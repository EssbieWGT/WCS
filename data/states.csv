Criminal defense lawyers say that’s because the state is intentionally deprioritizing much-needed changes, citing the lack of legislative action, as well as the underfunding of the public defender system, and an appeal filed by the state earlier this year seeking to block the temporary release of indigent defendants until they are provided legal representation.
Of the more than 35 bills related to indigent defense that the Legislature considered this session, only five became law. Gov. Janet Mills signed two of the bills while three more became law without her signature. Four additional bills were enacted by the Legislature but held by Mills to either veto within the first three days of the next session in January or let them become law without her signature. 
The governor vetoed one bill that aimed to clarify when an indigent defendant is entitled to counsel at the state’s expense. The laws that did pass, for the most part, did not enact any sweeping changes to the criminal justice system, three experts told the Maine Morning Star.
Meanwhile, there are still almost 300 people without attorneys as of August 27, almost 45 of whom are currently in jail, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of court data.
State commission, lawmakers declare ‘all hands on deck’ effort to address indigent defense crisis

“Overall, I would say it was a disappointing session. I understand, in light of the budget constraints everybody was under, that they felt they were limited in what they could do,” said Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services.
“But what left an especially sour taste in our mouths after the session concluded was that there was $150 million left over that they had not calculated correctly,” he added, referring to the $152 million surplus that Maine ended with at the close of the fiscal year on June 30, “and despite having a civil rights lawsuit still pending and a court order saying we’re violating the U.S. Constitution, we received very little in the way of new resources.”
Billings announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post in October.
Some defense attorneys argued that Mills is partly the reason for the Legislature’s lack of progress and funding for the public defense system.
“We have a governor who, through her cohorts, has made it very clear that they are not going to support any real, true criminal legal reform. We have a Legislature that has not been able to address this issue, or will not address this issue,” said Tina Nadeau, executive director of the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So anything that could have a wide impact on the people that we serve … has not had any positive reception.”
Mills’ office denied this claim, touting the recent establishment of the state’s first public defender offices and increasing the commission budget from approximately $20 million to $45 million per year. In 2023, Mills also signed into law a raise for private attorneys that the commission contracts with from $80 to $150.
“Despite having significantly more money, the number of rostered attorneys has not increased to required levels, and the system continues to struggle to find lawyers to represent indigent defendants,” Mills’ spokesperson Ben Goodman said.
Insufficient funding persists
However, Maine’s public defender offices are new and the 33 employed public defenders can’t take on all the indigent defendants’ cases, so the bulk of cases are still contracted out to private criminal defense lawyers. There are between 35 and 50 rostered attorneys out of a list of 300 that take on a majority of cases, with others working for the commission part-time. Those lawyers charged about 325,000 total billable hours last year, which Billings said amounted to about $48 million — exceeding the annual budget allocated to the commission.
“They’re not facing the reality that for a time period, we’re going to be paying for two systems, so it’s costing us over $56 million this year for a partial public defender system,” he said. “It’s going to take some patience and some amount of time for the public defenders to start absorbing the billable hours that were all going to the rostered attorneys before we start to see some savings.”
Because of those costs, the commission will have no funds left to keep paying rostered attorneys for the last quarter of the fiscal year, starting April 2026, unless the Legislature approves an additional $13 million before then, Billings said.

Those lawyers, which include Nadeau and Jim Howaniec, a longtime criminal defense lawyer and former mayor of Lewiston, are expecting major disruptions. 
“The rubber is going to hit the road come April 1, when people are still going to get arrested, but the criminal defense lawyers aren’t going to be paid,” Howaniec said.
Lawmakers on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee were caught between two competing realities this session, said co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland): “The need for [Public Defense Services] to have additional funding and the lack of a surplus of resources for the Legislature to appropriate.”
Both Nadeau and Howaniec pointed out that the state also has $1.03 billion in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also called the “rainy day fund,” which could be tapped for short-term relief. 
“The state of Maine has been sued for violating the Sixth Amendment. Is it not raining yet?” Nadeau asked.
Asked about the commission’s pending budget shortfall, the governor’s spokesperson said she would evaluate its budget and “work with the Legislature in the next legislative session to consider what needs may be reasonable —- and what the Commission itself can do — to continue to address this issue.”
“In the meantime, the Governor has said publicly that lawyers who represent indigent defendants should be confident they will be fully paid for their work,” Goodman added.
Goodman also cited Maine Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy’s March 2025 order that said the public defender offices are not taking on enough cases despite being staffed. He also pointed to the governor’s suggestion that the commission remove limits on the number of cases that private contracted lawyers could take on.










We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.


– Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services


However, Billings said in March there were only five public defenders responsible for training and taking on cases, and 1,000 defendants waiting for counsel. At that time, the offices were not fully operational with many positions still vacant, and there were many entry level and out-of-state attorneys with no Maine experience. 
“The state of Maine has simply not dedicated the necessary resources to solve this problem, and it cannot be fixed on the backs of five people,” he said. “We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.”
Legislative progress
One of the bills that became law without the governor’s signature this session, LD 1101 sponsored by Carney, funded eight new positions within the commission, five assistant defenders and three support staff. Carney said she hopes the law can support public defenders to take on cases that might be hard to find contracted defense lawyers for.
Michael Kebede, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said it was “very good” that the Legislature was able to fund this bill “in a legislative session where funding was very scarce.” 
“These positions are primarily responsible for providing indigent legal services to criminal defendants and parties in child protective proceedings, and that’s essentially the source of the crisis,” Kebede said. “There aren’t enough such people, and so this bill just creates more of the jobs that we need to solve the indigent defense crisis.”
Billings, however, said while the law created the new positions, they were not ones that the commission had requested. He also criticized the provision allowing the judicial branch to appoint attorneys not vetted or supervised by the commission, which he said was a step backward.
Broader reforms lacking
Even with adequate funding, the lack of broader reforms to the criminal justice system, which would decrease the number of people requiring legal defense, remains an issue. Hundreds of defendants who can’t afford attorneys are still facing the consequences of a harsh criminal code, Nadeau and Howaniec said.
“The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they’re economic, they’re political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system,” Howaniec said. 










The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they're economic, they're political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system.


– Jim Howaniec, criminal defense attorney


Carney said lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee shared this concern. “We are prosecuting things as crimes that shouldn’t be crimes under Maine’s criminal code, and by doing so, we’re unduly burdening both the judicial system and also the defense services,” she said.
But most of the reforms that would change the criminal code were either rejected by the committee, or were carried over to the next session. 
Lawmaker hopes to alleviate attorney backlog by changing how Maine punishes bail violations

Some of those include bills ensuring access to speedy trials for defendants, allowing people to be released on parole, decriminalizing small amounts of drug possession, limiting how many years younger people can be sentenced, diversifying the jury pool and getting rid of charges filed against someone out on bail who violates their conditions of release — Maine’s most common criminal charge.
That bill, LD 179 introduced by Rep. David Sinclair, an attorney from Bath, would have removed the crime of violating conditions of release. Maine is one of only six states with such a charge that serves as a separate class E crime, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
In 2024 alone, there were over 5,400 such charges filed in Maine courts, Frayla Tarpinian, a former prosecutor who oversees Maine’s first public defender office, said in a statement to the committee. In comparison, she said the second most common type of charge was 662 cases of drug possession.
Sinclair told Maine Morning Star in February that he believed removing the separate charge for violating conditions or release would help alleviate the state’s indigent defense system. 
However, that bill was ultimately opposed by the committee. Carney said while some agreed with the principles underlying the proposal, arguments that such a charge is an important tool for protecting survivors of domestic violence ultimately swayed their vote.
A related bill, which was one of the only ones signed into law this year, allows prosecutors to determine whether to reduce certain class E crimes to civil violations.
Maine is far from alone in struggling to pass broader reforms, said Abbe Smith, a law professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic at Georgetown University. 
“Everybody wants to be known as tough on crime, concerned about public safety, and I think opposition to commonsense reforms often plays on that fear of crime,” said Smith.
She added, “criminal defendants have no constituency. Nobody really cares about the quality of representation, except some lawyers and those who find themselves in the system.”
Indigent defense crisis in courts


Over the past few years, Maine’s indigent defense crisis has not substantially improved, with hundreds of people sitting in jail without attorneys over the years, Nadeau and Howaniec said. 
This January, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled the state’s failure to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney a constitutional crisis, and in March said the state must create a plan to address it.
Murphy, the judge, also agreed to consider releasing indigent defendants who have been jailed without legal counsel for at least 14 days, and to temporarily dismiss charges against defendants without representation for more than 60 days after their initial court appearance.
But the state appealed that decision and hearings on individual cases that could have started in June were paused until October when the case will go before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. As a result, no defendants were released or had their charges temporarily dismissed, according to the ACLU. 
“It’s such a problem that the brakes have been completely pumped on the most fundamental remedy for this ongoing crisis of people not having representation,” Nadeau said. “The real violation, from the state’s perspective, is these folks would be getting away with something, and how dare they. Because the state doesn’t think the people who are without counsel deserve a remedy.”
Next steps
Several other reforms will be considered when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
These include LD 1941, which would reestablish parole, and LD 449, which proposes conditional discharge for certain defendants. 
Carney said she doesn’t know whether it is possible to make the changes proposed in LD 449 to the state criminal code, although it is “trying to get at that same concern that we’re spending more resources charging and prosecuting people than we need to spend in order to achieve the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal code.”
Another carried over bill that Carney said could improve judicial efficiency is LD 340, which would establish different time limits for criminal trials. However, both Nadeau and the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers oppose the legislation because they say it is not adequate.
Another bill that could get taken up again next session is LD 338, which would expand jury pool diversity. That legislation was passed by both chambers but is being held by the governor. 
Howaniec said the lack of diversity in juries increases the inequity of Maine’s judicial system.
“There’s obviously a disproportionately larger number of minorities charged with crimes because there’s a correlation between poverty and crime,” Howaniec said. 
Carney agreed that the underlying policy is important and said it may be worth looking into how current jury pools are determined.

(Photo by Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)As Planned Parenthoods in the state and across the country navigate federal budget cuts, workers at an Ohio affiliate are fighting for the future of the organization.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced on Aug. 4 that staffing reductions were on the horizon, as a result of the cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget bill, and specific cuts that directly impact Planned Parenthood.
The greater Ohio affiliate announced the finalized reduction on Friday, with a total of 20 staff members losing their jobs. Of those 20, 17 were union members under Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio Workers United, the newly formed union under the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 98. Three other employees unaffiliated with the union also lost their jobs.
A press release announcing the staffing reductions said the cuts amount to more than $1.1 million in savings. Staffers were notified of layoffs throughout last week.
“We did everything we could to avoid layoffs,” said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio president and CEO Erica Wilson-Domer, in a statement with the announcement.
PPGOH Workers United is in their first ever negotiations for a bargaining agreement, having been voluntarily recognized by Planned Parenthood as a union at the beginning of 2025.
Since the announcement of funding cuts, the union created a letter-writing campaign for members. The call for letters acknowledged that budget cuts from the federal side “have been devastating” and that “hard decisions have to be made in light of these cuts,” but asked leaders to commit to a 25% reduction in salary.
“We don’t believe in advocating for salary cuts when it is unnecessary,” the union stated. “However, it has been made expressly clear in our negotiations that cutting a critical number of care-providing staff is management’s only solution to its budget crisis, and we don’t believe in cutting front-facing roles before all other options have been exhausted.”
The call for letters also stated that Planned Parenthood management in the greater Ohio affiliate had confirmed in mid-August that no plans were made to cut pay for the senior leadership team.
“We’ve lost some really important players,” Clarie Randall, an organizer at the OPEIU Local 98, told the Capital Journal.
Those that survived the layoffs continue to believe that their jobs and the clinics they work for are important to the communities they serve, and they plan to fight to keep them open.
“This is my community, I live in this community, I’ve raised my child in this community,” said Sarah Fernandez, who has been a health care assistant in Mansfield for three years. “I’m not planning on leaving, so I really need my community to be a safe and flourishing place.”
Wilson-Domer said overall cuts brought by the Trump administration amount to an annual loss of $10 million for the affiliate. Without a staffing reduction, the greater Ohio branch would “cease to exist, leaving over 50,000 patients without access to birth control, gender affirming care, abortion and a myriad of other essential services,” according to the affiliate leader.
A lawsuit has been filed by the national Planned Parenthood Federation of America to push back against Medicaid cuts, and the judge presiding over the case said Medicaid reimbursement should continue as the lawsuit goes forward.
The potential loss of Medicaid funds and the uncertainty in support for the work she does is “terrifying” for Fernandez, and adding tension in union negotiations and questions about transparency between affiliate leaders and workers has been disappointing.
“It’s terrifying to think that I might not be able to do what I do forever,” Fernandez said. “It feels like it’s much less about patient care and more like ‘we need to stay afloat.’”
Randall said bargaining agreement negotiations had been “amicable” until August, when staff were notified of the layoffs.
“It’s just been really disheartening, and I think morale is down,” Randall said. “It’s going to be harder (to provide care) because with fewer people there’s more jobs to cover, and workers are going to be spread thin.”
Wilson-Domer said the affiliate “has been engaged in nearly a month of good faith” negotiations with the union “regarding the necessary reduction in force and in consideration of various proposals.”
“This is a process that takes time,” Wilson-Domer said in a statement to the Capital Journal. “We understand that this is a stressful process for staff.”
She said the union has been informed that “overall director level and above compensation” has been cut by about $2 million.
“The impacts of a total $10 million funding loss unfortunately cannot be solved entirely through cutting executive compensation,” Wilson-Domer said.
The most recent tax filing for the non-profit (called a 990) is from 2023, in which Iris Harvey was still president and CEO, at an annual salary of $318,703. Wilson-Domer was chief strategy and transformation officer at the time, making $206,616 annually. Chief Medical Officer Adarsh Krishen was reported as making $177,022 per year and Chief External Affairs Officer Abigail Smardon was listed at an annual salary of $167,578.
Wilson-Domer reiterated that even with the staffing cuts, the organization “will continue to offer all of the services it currently does at our health centers.”
“This reduction does not include any health center closures,” she told the Capital Journal. “As long as our doors are open, PPGOH remains committed to providing high-quality, affordable and timely health care to all our patients.”
In Mansfield, Fernandez said as they await decisions about Medicaid funding and the true impact of local layoffs, struggles have to be expected, even as workers strive to keep providing the consistent service for those seeking birth control, STI screenings and gender affirming care, among other things.
“I think it’s really going to have to be a push of community members coming together and saying we need this clinic to stay open,” Fernandez said.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio’s new House minority leader, Dani Isaacsohn, says teaming up with the Republicans is essential to getting Democratic priorities accomplished.
Democrats are hopeful that new leadership can score them some wins as they prepare to head back to the Statehouse soon.
“Our focus as a caucus every single day is going to be ‘How do we serve the people of Ohio by making their lives better, making it more affordable, easier to access opportunity, more stability, more safety in their communities and their neighborhoods?'” Isaacsohn said.
The 36-year-old Cincinnati lawyer is the new face of the House Democrats, being voted to replace former Minority Leader Allison Russo, who stepped down in June to prepare for her secretary of state campaign.
Along with Isaacsohn, state Rep. Phil Robinson (D-Solon) is the assistant leader, state Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio (D-Gahanna) is the whip, and state Rep. Desiree Tims (D-Dayton) is the assistant whip.
Isaacsohn has risen to the top of the party since joining the legislature in 2023. He had been the whip since 2024 and was the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
Isaacsohn is known for bipartisanship, a strength he says will help Democrats stay relevant in the GOP-controlled supermajority.
“Nothing gets done without working together across the aisle,” the leader said.
While in the legislature, his focus has been on affordable housing. He helped make changes that provided relief to homeowners, earning him praise from leaders across the aisle.
“Dani Isaacsohn… very passionate about bridging the gap on Ohio’s housing challenges,” state Sen. Michele Reynolds (R-Canal Winchester) said.
Former lawmaker and current chair of the state’s property tax reform working group, Bill Seitz, emphasized the Democrat’s ability to find answers on property tax rates.
“There is a solution which Senator Blessing, Representative Isaacson have come up with,” Seitz said, adding that their proposal of a circuit breaker is the “best solution.”
Despite Isaacsohn’s positive relationship with the GOP, he will face challenges. Republicans do not need any Democratic votes in order to pass legislation.
“We would like to have 99 votes and that’s, that’s just typically is not possible,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said regarding the state’s operating budget.
The most impactful vote each General Assembly makes is the state’s massive two-year budget, one that, this year, didn’t get a single Democratic vote. Isaacsohn said he will work to help get the minority party into the decision-making room.
“We’re really focused on delivering results for the people we serve, and to do that, we have to work across the aisle,” Isaacsohn said.
The leader stayed in touch with Huffman over the summer break, he said, talking about topics like redistricting and the legislative calendar. The lawmakers are set to come back the week of September.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Kansas House Democrats made a recent stop in Hays on their statewide “fight back” tour. The event drew an impressive crowd of more than 100 people who overflowed into the various alcoves and hallways of the Glassman Bird Law Firm to listen to our representatives.
The mission for the evening, according to the webpage dedicated to the “fight back” tour, was as follows: “This tour isn’t just about conversation, it’s about mobilization. Together, we will strategize, organize, and take action to protect our democracy and advance a vision rooted in equity, opportunity, and justice for all Kansans.”
I was encouraged by the turnout, but I felt that the representatives who were present were unprepared to address the “protect our democracy” component of their mission statement.
The event began with questions about schools, property tax and appraisal processes but invariably turned toward national politics when a young woman voiced concerns about the deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and her fear of martial law being declared nationwide.
Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, D-Overland Park, reassured the questioner that martial law was unlikely to be declared in a red state like Kansas.
“I’m not pleased with what’s going on at the federal level, but I do not think that we will see martial law in Kansas. Lord have mercy, I hope I’m right on that, but instinctually I don’t think we will,” Clayton said.
I was annoyed. Our democratic representatives had been travelling around the state on a self-titled “fight back” tour for which they had printed banners and posters and even made a webpage. But when asked about the threat of right-wing authoritarianism in our country their response was simply to hope that it doesn’t happen in Kansas? Is crossing your fingers really the best way to “protect democracy”?
I raised my hand to tell Sawyer Clayton that her response to the question was not at all comforting. In turn she asked me what I thought she should do about martial law while adding that she was “open to suggestions.”
A good faith interpretation of her response would see it as fulfilling one of the objectives of the “fight back” tour — to organize and strategize as a community. But it felt to me like a teacher arriving to class and asking the students, “So, what would you like to do today?”
If House Democrats are truly interested in organizing toward the lofty goal of protecting democracy, they must come to these types of meetings with more than an openness to suggestions. They must have a plan!
My frustration only deepened at the end of the evening. Just as I was leaving, Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence, shook my hand and thanked me for coming and offering my input. I told him how surprised I was that they had not been corresponding or strategizing with Democrats in other states about how to counter the increasingly authoritarian maneuvers of the right.
He gave me a platitude about my generation being “agents of change” and encouraged me to make my voice heard through calls and emails. I don’t recall exactly what I said in response, but it was something along the lines of, “I’m literally in front of you right now.”
It is frustrating that Democrats in Kansas and across the United States continue to warn of “democracy in peril” in their tweets, speeches, and event promotions, while still delivering canned statements and maintaining a business-as-usual politics that fails to match the gravity of their rhetoric and of our political situation.
Kansas Democrats recently sent a letter to Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall asking for congressional oversight on the Department of Homeland Security. But only 17 of 37 Kansas House Democrats and five of the nine Kansas Senate Democrats signed the letter. This falls far short of the unity that is required to meet the challenges ahead. Sending the letter is a good start, but it’s the kind of thing that Kansas Democrats should be doing weekly if not daily.
Kansas Democrats need to begin thinking seriously about worst case scenarios. What would they do if the National Guard were deployed in Kansas? Would they file a lawsuit? Break quorum? Protest — and how? What if Trump were to blackmail Kansas universities as he has done to Harvard and Columbia? What if one of their constituents were arrested for writing an op-ed that criticizes Israel?
These are not abstract hypotheticals. Trump has recently ordered the mobilization of more National Guard troops from 19 states and is signaling his intention to send troops into Chicago in the same manner that he has done in D.C.
The representatives on the “fight back” tour are decent, intelligent people who truly have Kansans’ best interests at heart. That was clear to me. My point in writing this is not to disparage their character but to point out that they have a serious blind spot when it comes to being prepared for authoritarianism.
They, along with Democrats across the country, might be caught in what the political philosopher David Runciman calls the “confidence trap.” Each time a democracy overcomes a crisis it gains confidence that it will do the same in the future. Eventually, a crisis may arrive where citizens and politicians will fail to do the things that got them through the crises of the past because they believe implicitly that they will pull through.
Our democracy may have weathered the storm of Trump 1.0, but its second iteration is already far more extreme and unrestrained. If we want to make it through, Kansas Democrats need to stop being complacent and get activated. This means developing contingency plans, speaking to lawyers and working to develop a united front among all Kansas Democrats.
On a personal level, they should be reading literature from our Founding Fathers or resistance fighters like Nelson Mandela who put their lives on the line for freedom and democracy. Because in addition to collective action, they should be asking themselves how far they are personally prepared to go if our democracy is what’s at stake.

Trump is currently facing legal challenges over his 60-day deployment of troops in Los Angeles earlier this year under equally unfounded claims about violence and risk — and against the wishes of the troops themselves.
Now he’s ordering soldiers into our streets for the fourth time as president to viciously target some of the most vulnerable members of our society — despite abundant evidence that prosecuting homelessness only makes it worse.
The cost of this cruel power grab is borne by taxpayers like you and me.
Previous reporting found that National Guard deployments cost the U.S. government $530 per Guard member, per day. So the price tag of deploying 2,091 troops to D.C. is well over $1 million per day — and the number of troops will likely continue to grow. And with no deadline for the D.C. deployment, those costs could add up for months or even years.
This militarized spending comes at the expense of federal programs — like public housing — that actually do prevent crime and improve health and education outcomes.
Using those figures and other publicly available data, I calculated that the daily cost of operating public housing for all 5,616 people who are unhoused in D.C. on any given night is one-quarter the daily expense of deploying the National Guard. If the Guard remains deployed for three months, it would cost more than operating public housing for the entire unhoused population in D.C. for an entire year. 
That’s also true in the states whose GOP governors are voluntarily sending National Guard troops to the capital. Across those six states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia — some 30,000 people are unhoused. The daily cost of operating safe shelter for all 30,000 would be less than one day of the D.C. occupation.
In fact, it’s true in almost every state, I learned.
The daily expense of deploying troops to D.C. is more than four times the daily cost of operating public housing for Georgia’s unhoused population, five times for Nevada’s unhoused population, and 15 times for all unhoused people in Wisconsin.
If you want numbers for your own city, county, state, or congressional district, you can use the National Priorities Project’s trade off calculator at NationalPriorities.org to learn more about what taxpayers in your area are paying towards militarism — and the services we could be enjoying instead.
Trump’s decision to hyper-militarize our streets is transpiring on the heels of the MAGA budget bill, which cuts food and medical services for millions across the country to further enrich billionaires and war profiteers.
Deploying troops in our nation’s capital, rather than investing in what makes communities safe and prosperous, is yet another attempt to scapegoat struggling people — especially communities of color — to advance a draconian agenda in service of billionaires, war profiteers, and white supremacy.
Government spending on straightforward solutions that help poor and working-class people faces constant political backlash. But providing affordable housing to end homelessness in D.C. would be far cheaper than deploying troops — and would do far more to improve the city’s security.

Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state last Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotas. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

(Photo courtesy of LifeWise Academy.)In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
 Identical bill language

The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
Public schools would be required to allow dismissal for religious instruction under new bill

ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
 Ten Commandment displays

Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.










This is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment.


– Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy


After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

The program started small by collecting, checking, and distributing bikes to low-income adults and youth through the basic needs nonprofit WAIM. 
I was excited to be awarded a CT Department of Transportation (CT DOT) Active Transportation microgrant in 2024. With the $ 5,000 grant, we could distribute locks and helmets and purchase a set of repair tools that we’d been borrowing from volunteers. This felt like a win after news that several bikes had been stolen. These bikes are a form of transportation for many people, especially those unhoused or marginally housed, even in the dead of winter. The recycling program’s impact was visible in the increased bikes around Willimantic.
Like many small New England cities and towns with pre-car footprints, Willimantic has a dense, walkable core. I live in the Victorian Hill Section, which is rated “Very Walkable.” Willimantic is the most walkable part of Windham County. While the Willimantic Hill Section is “Very Walkable”, it’s rated as “Somewhat Bikeable.” 
There are no protected bike lanes and no lights on the Airline rail trail, which runs through the center of Willimantic and connects two public housing developments to downtown. Even without infrastructure, biking requires resources like maintenance. Willimantic’s only bike shop, Pedal Power, closed in 2024. Biking requires physical ability, preference, and tolerance to winter ice and summer heat.  Biking without bike lanes, lights, or other support isn’t for most people. And many opportunities exist outside of a reasonable bike commuting distance.  Willimantic is dominated by cars and their associated infrastructure, ranging from parking lots to garages.
Public resources allocated to car investment far exceed those allocated to alternative transit programs, such as the CT DOT microgrants. While there are no protected bike lanes in Willimantic, a parking garage opened in 2022 with 290 parking spots at a reported cost of $12.5 million, with $6 million reimbursed from the state. The garage has eight free electric vehicle (EV) chargers, which disproportionately support wealthier residents.  
A 2024 Gallup poll found that households with incomes over $100,000 are three times more likely to own an EV than households with incomes between $40,000 and $99,000 and seven times more likely than households with incomes under $40,000. These public subsidies are not equitable. As a community college professor with an EV, my parking and charging can be free, while people bike without lanes, and people stand waiting for buses without benches or shelters. This is a regressive pro-car system.
Beyond EVs, wealthier people are more likely to own cars in the U.S., except for public transit-dense cities like New York City and Boston. Public investment in cars, parking, and road subsidies is regressive, benefiting wealthier individuals. 
Due to the lack of other affordable and accessible alternatives, cars are highly desirable for lower-income people. People with cars are more likely to find and keep a job, and are also more likely to have access to food and healthcare. However, cars can be traps for low-income people. The total cost of owning a car can exceed $ 1,000 per month, which includes the costs of the vehicle, insurance, taxes, gas or electricity, maintenance, and repairs. According to a 2025 Bankrate report, the majority of Americans struggle to pay $1,000 in unexpected expenses, such as a car repair, and can be destabilized or take on debt. 
Car costs can be so disruptive to family well-being, and social service agencies are taking notice. A Minneapolis Social Worker became a mechanic and started Lift Garage, providing low-cost repairs. WAIM offers emergency assistance for car expenses that dwarf the bike program.  Beyond repair costs, car costs can be predatory. Racialized minorities, on average, pay more for cars through higher rates for car insurance, car loan denials/predatory loans, and police tickets to drivers.
While getting, insuring, and maintaining cars are a challenge for lower-income people, life without a car on the eastern side of the state can be dangerous.  A lack of access to reliable and affordable transportation can be a barrier to healthcare access.
Generation’s Federally Qualified Health Center primarily serves uninsured and underinsured patients in Eastern Connecticut, with a center located in Willimantic. A study by Generations found that 35% of their patients missed at least one health appointment due to transportation issues; and 67% of their patients reported lacking reliable transportation due to not owning or being unable to use a car.  Without access to a car, public transportation options are limited.  Under 4% of Connecticut commuters use public transportation to get to work. In smaller cities, options are more limited. Willimantic’s Windham Regional Transportation District (WRTD) has no direct connection to CT’s FastTrack regional bus service or CT Rail and Metro North train service.
While I appreciate the CT DOT microgrant’s support of a small bike recycling program in Willimantic, it highlights the need for a progressive transportation agenda to improve transportation access. 
There are efforts to make Connecticut more public transportation-friendly. The CT House Bill 5390, “Work, Live, Ride,” was reintroduced in 2024  to incentivize dense, walkable infrastructure in transit-oriented districts by allocating funds to build more housing connected to public transportation. 
While public transportation is more comprehensive in denser areas like Hartford or New Haven, what could make transportation more accessible to lower-income individuals in Willimantic and cities across Connecticut? There could be a massive reinvestment in affordable public transportation. The state could establish regional rail between all population centers, as they were connected during the industrial era, and implement fare-free buses within population centers, similar to the ones introduced during the pandemic that increased ridership. 
Baltimore’s Charm City Circulator is a free bus service downtown, but excludes many poorer outlying neighborhoods.  I believe many lower-income people would benefit from these changes. I asked my community college students in Willimantic if they’d like affordable, reliable public transportation over a car, and most of them enthusiastically said yes. It took decades to disinvest in and dismantle most urban streetcars and trains, with public investment in highways and other infrastructure enabling car-driven, segregated suburban sprawl. It will take years of transportation being affordable and reliable for people to depend on to change where they live, work, attend school, and perhaps even get rid of a car.
Intercity trains and intracity buses would entail a shift in urban development and substantial public investment, as seen across Western Europe and around the world. Public transit is a public investment and not a market service. Rider fees don’t cover operational costs. Rising fares in public transit-dense New York City only cover about 25% of operational costs. Bike infrastructure and recycling programs like the one at WAIM can be part of an accessible alternative. Real change to challenge regressive car-centric urban landscapes requires public transit that is accessible, reliable, and affordable.

Created to describe the Nazi’s systematic extermination of 6,000,000 Jews, “genocide” has a high evidentiary threshold in law. It’s not merely a descriptor for war or humanitarian crises but presupposes an extreme level of barbarity. 
Given these facts, it is disturbing to read opinion pieces in various publications, including the July 15 Mirror op-ed ‘In search of moral clarity (again)’,” that promote unsubstantiated Hamas claims, use ‘‘Palestinian genocide’ as accepted fact, and rely on alarmism, for example, by drawing a parallel between Israel’s 20-month defensive war and the Rwandan genocide, a minimally reported horror that saw 800,000 tortured, raped, and killed within four months.
The Gaza Health Ministry is part of the vast and successful propaganda machine that is integral to Hamas’ power. We should carefully evaluate pro-Hamas claims and make every effort to avoid oversized rhetoric like invoking the Rwandan genocide. 
The mainstream media, having published some inexcusably flawed articles, also bear responsibility here. For example, a precipitous and reckless BBC news articles accused Israel of a late-2023 rocket attack on Gaza’s Al-Ahli Hospital. In fact, both U.S. and French intelligence identified a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket failure for the destruction and casualties. When outlets get it wrong, as they often do  when  competing for “clicks,” especially when relying on sources within Gaza, they do not correct or retract but merely “update” the existing article. The “updates” do not receive attention. Instead, the media often pass the corrections off as a “changing landscape” issue rather than a deficient reporting and sourcing issue.
We see the same incomplete reporting on Hamas’ Gaza Health Ministry death figures. The Associated Press has finally, but not sufficiently, massaged its boilerplate language to try more fully to explain the data.
The Henry Jackson Society published a report identifying multiple anomalies and caveats in the Gaza death data. At the time of the report, Palestinians and AP claimed 40,000 deaths from military operations in civilian areas. They did not identify which dead were terrorists, and they purposefully concealed that Hamas is using schools, hospitals and even U.N. buildings for military command and operations. Hamas has turned civilian infrastructure into legal military targets. In fact, the Jackson Society researchers could attribute more than half of the 40,000 to battlefield deaths, friendly fire incidents involving Islamic extremist munitions (like Al-Ahli Hospital), and deaths unrelated to the war.
It bears repeating that Israel has made unprecedented efforts to avoid killing civilians and been consistent in its war aims to recover the hostages and end Hamas control in Gaza. On the other hand, Hamas and its Palestinian supporters publicly proclaimed their intent to kill civilians and eradicate Jews from Israel, planned the October 7 attack on Israeli civilians for 17 years; and are still holding Israeli hostages. By definition alone, the genocidal entity is Hamas.
I was dismayed that the author of the op-ed suggested we should relitigate the 108- year-old Balfour Declaration as though Israel was some sort of gift to the indigenous Jewish people. The Balfour Declaration was a long-fought for starting point to return Jews to their ancestral homeland. For 3,000 years Jews have lived in what’s now Israel. To suggest it started with Lord Balfour is an argument that fundamentally denies Jewish self-determination. After all, the Balfour Declaration is rooted in World War I and the fall of the Ottoman empire. Borders changed, territory was apportioned to the Arabs, Jews, and many other groups. Yet, I’ve never heard the charge of colonialism levied at anyone except the Jews. Funny about that.
Finally, while I’d like to believe in the best of humanity, according to the latest Palestine Center poll, the “overwhelming majority” of Palestinians don’t want Hamas to disarm. Despite Hamas’ own video evidence, 90% don’t believe Hamas men raped, brutalized, and killed civilians on October 7; most believe the anti-Hamas uprisings in Gaza are contrived; and half don’t support the protests against Hamas’ brutality. 
Over the past 100+ years, the Palestinians have insisted on maintaining perpetual refugee status, working toward elimination of Israel, instead of permanently settling in their own sovereign state. The world has logged tens of thousands of diplomatic hours and billions of dollars working towards a two-state solution, which the Palestinians have consistently rejected. 
In return, Palestinians and their leaders have given the world only violence, terrorism, and 75+ years of intransigence. It’s something to think about when people tell you they “stand in solidarity with Palestinians.”

The Harwood Planning and Zoning Board and City Council voted in favor of the $3 billion Applied Digital data center that seeks to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence computing. 
The Planning and Zoning Board recommended rezoning a 320-acre area southeast of Harwood from agriculture to light industrial. The City Council then approved a first reading of the zoning change and a building permit for MBN Engineering of Fargo that will work on the project. A second vote by the council is required to finalize the zoning change and the building permit. The votes would likely come at the October meeting.

Harwood Mayor Blake Hankey said the zoning change and data center would help insulate Harwood from development from the north side of Fargo. 
“I’m hoping that’s going to stop Fargo from coming into our backyard,” Hankey said.
Hankey said Fargo is attempting to annex the site that is between Harwood and Fargo, which he believes is illegal. But, if the site were to become part of Fargo, Harwood residents would have to deal with the potential negatives, such as noise and traffic, without the tax benefits, Hankey said. 
The Harwood City Council also formally voted to oppose Fargo’s annexation. Fargo city leaders voted unanimously last month to approve resolutions to annex land north of the city that includes the data center site, The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead reported. The annexation would need approval from Harwood leaders.
Harwood resident Darlene Meyer said she had come around the idea of the data center being built nearby, in part because of Fargo’s intentions. 
She called the Harwood government’s actions “the biggest decision in the history of Harwood.”
After the unanimous vote from the Planning and Zoning Committee, several people in the crowd called out “shame.”  
Texas-based Applied Digital last month announced the project that the company says would add 200 to 300 jobs and tax revenue for the town of about 900 people.
Harwood resident Deb Moug said her research led to some of the negatives of data centers, such as high power consumption and impact on the quality of life. She cautioned leaders to take more time on making decisions. 
“I think people are too anxious to jump on the AI bandwagon without really thinking this through,” she said. 
Some members of the public called for an environmental impact study.

If built, the Harwood center would be Applied Digital’s third project in North Dakota, with its largest data center at Ellendale, a town of about 1,100. 
The Harwood project received a cool reception at a community meeting organized by Applied Digital on Aug. 25. 
Tuesday’s City Council portion of the meeting started with Hankey cutting short comments from a Harwood resident who wanted to criticize how Applied Digital approached the city. Hankey tried to limit the comments to specific to the zoning change and not the Applied Digital business model. 
As residents shouted at the mayor, he asked to have one person removed. Some others left  voluntarily. 
Later in the public hearing, however, Hankey and others made comments about Applied Digital.
After the hearing and before the vote, Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins and Executive Vice President Nick Phillips took several questions about topics such as traffic flow and utility rates. 
They said they would work with local officials to minimize truck traffic through Harwood. Cummins said there would not be noticeable surges in traffic when workers start and end shifts. 
“It’s a significant number of jobs, but not an overwhelming number of jobs,” he said. 
Phillips also said a recent off-peak rate increase by Cass County Rural Electric Cooperative, which will provide power to the center, is not related to the project. 
They reiterated how North Dakota’s cool climate allows for more energy-efficient data centers than warmer states. 
In announcing the project, Applied Digital said it hoped to break ground yet this month, but Cummins said the company would have to wait for final approval from the city. 
“It’s as soon as we can make it happen,” Cummins said. “We love the weather here for what we do, but it does create some problems for construction.”

Wes Moore (D) and his wife Dawn Moore watch the final moments of the 2024 General Assembly session from the Senate gallery. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A quiet international birthday trip for Gov. Wes Moore’s wife got splashed across a British tabloid over the Labor Day holiday.
A shirtless Moore and his wife Dawn were photographed over the weekend lounging on a yacht owned by George Clooney, the actor and political benefactor, according to The Daily Mail, which broke the story.
The Daily Mail headline had all the bold-typeface subtlety and nuance to be expected from a tabloid from across the pond: “Damning photos burn top Dem’s 2028 plans to the ground as he’s busted half-naked on kingmaker George Clooney’s luxury yacht in ITALY… while his ‘hellhole’ state faces crime apocalypse.”
The publication reported that Clooney and his wife had been in town for a film festival. The couple left the Moores with access to their Lake Como villa — valued at an estimated $100 million.
The trip — described as a personal vacation to a personal friend’s residence — was not listed on Moore’s public schedule.
“The Governor paid for a trip to celebrate his wife’s 50th birthday,” David Turner, Moore’s communications director, said in a statement Tuesday.
Moore did not temporarily leave Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller in charge while he vacationed, according to the governor’s office.

	“The governor was not temporarily unable to perform his duties and therefore did not appoint the lieutenant governor to serve as acting governor in his stead,” Turner said in his statement, in response to questions about Miller’s role. Turner included a link to relevant sections of the Maryland Constitution addressing when a lieutenant governor would assume the duties of the governor.
Republicans made hay of the trip, which drew a sharp attack from the White House.
“The crime crisis ravaging your city is no problem at all when you can jet off to an Italy yacht vacation,” Abigail Jackson, deputy White House press secretary, posted on X. “Unfortunately for residents of Baltimore, this isn’t their reality. Yet, Wes (wannabe President) Moore insists there’s no crime problem and he doesn’t need help!”
Moore and President Donald Trump (R) have been trading barbs over the last week over the state of crime in Baltimore, with Trump hinting again Tuesday that he might send federal troops into Maryland though he did not say when.
The visit also raises questions about Moore’s political future.
Clooney has built a name for himself in politics hosting fundraisers including one for Joe Biden’s failed re-election bid. The Daily Mail said Clooney has expressed some support for a presidential bid by his recent house guest.
In an April interview on CNN, Clooney praised Moore, calling him “a proper leader.”

(Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission on Tuesday advanced stricter regulations than the board adopted earlier this summer, leaving some advocates feeling more concerned.
All five commissioners voted to amend the emergency regulations that have been in effect since June 29 but were set to expire by the end of September. The new regulations, which would still allow the commission to begin licensing registered medical cannabis establishments by a voter-mandated Oct. 1 deadline, is contingent upon Gov. Jim Pillen’s approval. He approved the first rules in June. Tuesday was the commission’s fourth meeting since June, the first that all commissioners attended.
The revised regulations would, for the first time, set extensive testing and security requirements and establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” for in-state physicians to recommend medical cannabis. If approved, the rules would remain in effect for up to 90 days.

Practitioners participating in the program would have to take 10 hours of continuing education on medical cannabis and complete two hours annually to stay in compliance. Physicians would need to prescribe specific dosages and potency levels. After that, a patient or caregiver could purchase the recommended medical cannabis amount at a specific dispensary only once every 30 days.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. But they could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within a 90-day period. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
The amended requirements maintain a statewide limit of no more than 12 medical cannabis dispensaries, arranged by judicial district. That would mean one dispensary each in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data.
The rules would still prohibit dispensaries from selling smoking or vaping products and edibles of any kind. While the earlier rules would have allowed the sale of non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, the revised rules would not. Oral tablets with a “thin layer” of flavoring to make the products swallowable would now be allowed.
Under current law, a patient or qualified caregiver with a recommendation from any health care practitioner can legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, in any form. But without licensing, cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska yet.
2024 ballot measures
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the nonprofit that led the successful 2024 ballot measures to legalize and regulate medical cannabis, said Tuesday’s vote should leave Nebraskans “outraged.”

About 71% of voters in November approved legalization, and about 67% created the Medical Cannabis Commission and “exclusively” vested in it the authority to regulate the drug.
Among Eggers’ frustrations was the board’s decision to limit the number of cultivator licenses and products manufacturer licenses offered to four each. The earlier emergency regulations and state law set no limit.
Eggers told the Nebraska Examiner that commissioners “didn’t just ignore” their voter-mandated regulatory authority, “they shredded it.”
“By approving rules that pile on new barriers and unlawfully restrict forms of cannabis, they are dismantling what the people demanded at the ballot box,” Eggers said in a statement. “This is a direct assault on patients, families and the democratic process itself. Nebraskans voted for access to medicine. 
“Instead, the commission delivered defiance, obstruction and betrayal.”
Confusion over draft regs
The new proposed set of emergency regulations was released quietly late Tuesday morning. The timing left advocates scrambling to understand the changes between an early 20-page set of rules to the new 46-page document.
That’s if the public knew the regulations were ready for review at all, or if they could decipher what the commission intended by releasing two versions of draft regulations: a “Version A” (with 46 pages) and a “Version B with highlights” (47 pages) to be considered at the 1 p.m. hearing.

The commission did not explain the competing drafts before the public comment period, and many advocates told the Examiner they thought “Version B” was the set they should review, given the “highlighted” label and a limited time frame.
Among the major differences: “Version B” would have allowed up to 21 dispensaries rather than 12, with more dispensaries allowed in more populous areas. It also appeared to permit vaping and created a framework of vertical licensing, or the ability for someone to apply for multiple types of licenses.
However, those changes, endorsed by multiple testifiers across the commission’s initial meetings, fell mostly on deaf ears, with only Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln voicing public support. 
Public weighs in
Eggers, at one point Tuesday, thanked commissioners for listening to Nebraskans about the higher dispensary limit, not yet knowing the board was preparing to go in another direction.
She said limiting cultivators was “counterintuitive” and could break the supply chain “from the start.”
Cody Jester of Fairfield echoed Eggers’ concerns and said he was interested in cultivation. He said he had tried to work with local officials and his local health department, a requirement the first regulations outlined. But the new regulations adopted Tuesday removed that step. Jester said it could take months to grow medical cannabis but that farmers were ready.

Josh Egle from Banner County said he appreciated the commission establishing a lottery system to review licensing applications. But he suggested a hybrid lottery-merit system that could bring in quality candidates but also allow the participation of locals wanting to get involved. 
Denise Wegener of Omaha said the quickest alleviation for her is smoking or vaping marijuana, which she said has given her her life back from a debilitating health condition.
“We’re not just Joe Schmo out here recreationally getting high for fun,” Wegener said. “We’re using this as medication to heal our bodies.”
Several people also again encouraged the commission to view them as patients. Lia Post of Springfield, for instance, told the commission to not listen to Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who urged lawmakers not to pass a medical cannabis legislative bill this spring.
That bill, backed by Eggers, Post and other 2024 petitioners, sought to give commissioners more funding, time and support. It fell 10 votes short, leaving the regulatory board to act on its own, with limited funds.
“I’m so glad my life is now in the hands of this Pete Ricketts-Jim Pillen-Mike Hilgers firing squad. Yay,” Post told the commission. “More people who want me and patients like me to die.”

Bill Hawkins of the Nebraska Hemp Company also lambasted the commission for the new health care practitioner directory that would exclude out-of-state recommendations.
“Patients’ rights are still in effect,” said Hawkins, who is again leading a petition effort to legalize recreational marijuana. “There is nothing in the law that says a patient with a recommendation — from any state, any ailment — [has] to buy your poison pill from your dispensary.”
Cultivators and vaping
Bailey echoed the public’s support for more cultivators and for vertical licensing, suggesting more for cultivators, possibly six. He cautioned that one cultivator’s supply chain failure, or a bad crop year, could ripple and cause costs to skyrocket. He also said the growing limit didn’t make sense, adding: “I can’t imagine buying a farm and telling me I can’t grow corn because my neighbor’s growing.”
“You got the funnel upside down,” Bailey said. “We want competition in this world. That’s what free enterprise is about.”

Commissioners Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna said they worried about oversaturation compared to other states. 
But Bailey contended that without competition, Nebraska could create a black market opposite to the commission’s intent and that many cultivators wouldn’t grow product if there wasn’t demand.
Bailey also led the charge to allow vaping products, a stance that Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist and commission chair, and Mueting, an addiction prevention specialist, resisted. The two women had expressed their stance when Pillen appointed them in May.
“Nobody will say that vaping is medicine,” Oldenburg said. “And when I’ve talked to every physician that I know and I ask them this, they really do look at me like I have three heads, like I’m making a funny joke.”
Legal threats
After the back and forth, commissioners entered a closed session for more than an hour to discuss what they described as “strategy for imminent litigation.” 
The commission is currently being sued to overturn the voter-approved laws, with a former state senator mainly arguing the state laws contradict federal law against marijuana. A Lancaster County judge dismissed the case. It is being appealed.

At the same time, Hilgers and his office have threatened to sue the commission when it begins licensing, which could come as early as the commission’s meeting on Sept. 30. He has advanced a similar argument that the voter-approved laws are preempted by federal law.
After emerging from the executive session, Mueting suggested about six changes, roughly what Bailey had suggested, including the change capping cultivators at four, for instance. But commissioners didn’t discuss why they were proposing those specific changes over others.
Mueting also updated a separate regulatory effort to establish a seed-to-sale tracking system without state funds. She said a company Metrc, a cannabis compliance tracking system and software firm, had voiced interest in exploring a self-funded model in which businesses would pay into the Nebraska system instead of paying the commission.
Without legislative approval, the commission can’t accept any fees, fines or funds. In the meantime, the commission will partner with the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, of which Bailey is chair, to share up to $150,000 to cover the cannabis board’s operating expenses. 
‘Knock-down, drag-out process’
The commissions also plan to cooperate in asking lawmakers for sufficient funds next session after lawmakers refused to give the Medical Cannabis Commission its own line item in the state budget.

The commission will prioritize cultivator licenses first. Applications meeting the commission regulations can be emailed to mcc.contact@nebraska.gov or mailed to the Liquor Control Commission between Sept. 4 and Sept. 23.
Despite legal threats and legislative inaction, Eggers and others said voters have given the commission a clear mandate.
“This doesn’t have to be a knock-down, drag-out process, but there is a clear law that was passed,” Eggers told the commission. “I would appreciate, and the patients here and the patients in this state would appreciate you adhering to what the voters passed.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission is scheduled to meet next at 1 p.m. Sept. 30.

(File photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)The developer of a planned Maryland offshore wind farm insisted Tuesday that a related steel manufacturing facility in Sparrows Point will move forward, despite the federal government withdrawing a $47.4 million grant for the project last week.
The Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Project was one of a dozen projects targeted by the U.S. Department of Transportation Friday when it withdrew $679 million in previously approved grants for port and rail infrastructure improvements in support of wind power projects across the country.
In announcing the cuts, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said they were part of a Trump administration effort to slash funding for “doomed” offshore wind farms.
The administration of President Joe Biden “bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry,” Duffy said in a statement Friday. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”
But US Wind, the Baltimore-based wind farm developer behind the Sparrows Point project, was defiant Tuesday. It said the $400 million project planned for nearly 100 acres on the site of the former Bethlehem Steel mill “will continue to move forward, ultimately bringing hundreds of manufacturing jobs to the Baltimore region.”
The company added that steel manufactured on the site would also fuel the shipbuilding industry.
“There continues to be a robust market for steel components for the energy and shipbuilding industries, and US Wind is confident that just as steel has been a key part of the region’s past, Sparrows Point Steel will be an important part of Maryland’s industrial future,” wrote Nancy Sopko, US Wind’s vice president for external affairs, in a statement.
Trump administration plans to revoke federal approval for Ocean City wind farm

The facility is expected to fabricate steel components for wind turbines, including towers and monopiles. In 2023, US Wind inked a “long-term partnership” deal with Haizea Wind Group, a company that focuses on turbine design, manufacturing and assembly, with facilities in Spain’s Basque Country and in France.
Later that year, US Wind announced it had won the grant funding from the federal government for the Sparrows Point project. It said the influx of cash would “help transform the site into a sustainable working waterfront by supporting extensive upgrades needed for large offshore wind components to be staged and transported to offshore wind project sites along the East Coast.”
Duffy said the funding revocation came after a “review of all discretionary grant programs with obligated and unobligated projects” turned up the wind projects “not aligned with the goals and priorities of the administration.”
President Donald Trump has made his intentions clear from the start, beginning with a January executive order pausing new offshore wind leasing activities in federal waters. A group of 18 Democratic attorneys general challenged the order, and the case is set for a hearing in Boston on Thursday.
In a statement Friday, the Oceantic Network, an offshore wind industry group, argued that the port projects defunded by the Trump administration would serve multiple industries, including defense, citing upgrades to the Port of Davisville in Rhode Island and Virginia’s Fairwinds Landing, which were expected to be multiuse sites.
“The Trump administration is weakening our country’s national security and destroying good-paying jobs by pulling critical funding designed to update our aging maritime infrastructure,” said Oceantic CEO Liz Burdock.
US Wind’s own wind farm, planned to be off the coast of Ocean City, has faced its own roadblocks of late.
US Wind won the final federal permit for the Ocean City project in the waning days of the Biden administration, but Trump’s Interior Department indicated in a court filing last week that it intends to revoke the major federal permit for the project that was years in the making.
The Town of Ocean City, which has mounted an aggressive campaign against the US Wind project, had filed a lawsuit targeting that very permit. The federal government argued the town could pump the brakes, since Interior was planning to withdraw the permit anyway.
Ocean City’s mayor and council have also challenged an air pollution permit issued to US Wind by the state of Maryland — one of the last permits that the wind company needed in order to begin construction. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency also weighed in on that state-issued permit, arguing in an unconventional letter that the document should go through an EPA appeals process — as opposed to state courts. Ocean City, accordingly, filed appeals in both places.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland joined 21 states and the District of Columbia on a brief in support of federal labor unions who are suing to block President Donald Trump’s executive order canceling collective bargaining agreements with dozens of federal offices.
The friend-of-the-court brief, filed Friday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, argues that Trump’s order violates the affected workers’ First Amendment rights and retaliates against them for not adhering with the president’s agenda.
“Federal workers constitute one in ten Maryland jobs, serving our communities in roles such as nurses at veterans’ hospitals, environmental scientists, agricultural inspectors, and administrative support specialists,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement Tuesday.
“These dedicated public servants deserve a voice in the workplace,” Brown’s statement said. “Without the right to collectively bargain, they risk losing the protections, fair wages, and safe working conditions they need to support their families and serve the public effectively.”
President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 27 that said labor agreements were being canceled “to enhance the national security.” The agencies targeted ranged from the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security to the Bureau of Land Management and the Federal Communications Commission, according to guidance at the time from the Office of Personnel Management.
Two more agencies cancel union contracts, as FEMA, USCIS end collective bargaining

Trump expanded that list on Thursday with another executive order that added NASA, the commissioner of patents in the Patent and Trademark Office, the National Weather Service and the U.S. Agency for Global Media — which oversees Voice of America — among other agencies.
“The agencies and agency subdivisions set forth in … this order are hereby determined to have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work,” Trump’s order said.
The American Federation of Government Employees — one of six federal unions that had sued to block Trump’s original executive order — said after Thursday’s order that it will continue to fight.
“AFGE is preparing an immediate response and will continue to fight relentlessly to protect the rights of our members, federal employees and their union,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.
U.S. District Judge James Donato issued a preliminary injunction June 24 that blocked implementation of Trump’s order, noting that a White House fact sheet published with the original order called out “hostile Federal unions” that “have declared war on President Trump’s agenda” and are “‘fighting back’ against Trump.”
But the 9th Circuit lifted that injunction, on Aug. 1, saying that Trump’s order “on its face … does not express any retaliatory animus. Instead, it conveys the President’s determination that the excluded agencies have primary functions implicating national security.”
Since then, federal agencies have moved swiftly to end labor agreements with their workers, reclaiming office space from the unions and canceling arbitration and grievance hearings, among other actions.
The Center for American Progress estimates more than 1 million federal workers, representing about 81% of federal labor union membership, are affected by Trump’s executive order
Besides Maryland, other jurisdictions signed on to the brief include the District of Columbia and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)In 2012, Alaska State Troopers arrested Fairbanks pilot Ken Jouppi and seized his aircraft after charging him with bootlegging for shipping beer into the dry community of Beaver.
Now, after 13 years of legal disputes, the state’s decision to seize Jouppi’s airplane could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning nonprofit public interest law firm, last week asked the Supreme Court to consider overturning an Alaska Supreme Court ruling from April. That ruling declared that the state’s decision to seize Jouppi’s plane was not an excessive fine for bootlegging.
The “petition for a writ of certiorari” — a formal document asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue — was filed last week, an official with the Institute confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.
The odds are against Jouppi — the Supreme Court takes only about 1% of the cases it receives. If cases filed with a fee waiver are excluded — those usually come from prisoners representing themselves in a last-ditch appeal — the acceptance rate is 5% or less.
Now 85 and retired, Jouppi was a longtime air taxi pilot in Fairbanks when he planned to ferry a passenger and her groceries from that hub city to Beaver, a village in the Interior.
Before takeoff, an Alaska State Trooper noticed a six-pack of beer visible in the baggage. Beaver had outlawed the sale, consumption and importation of alcohol in 2004. Troopers searched the plane and found three cases of beer — two Budweiser, one Bud Light — intended for the passenger’s husband, the local postmaster.
Jouppi was indicted on bootlegging charges, convicted, and sentenced. His sentence included three days in jail and a fine. State prosecutors asked that he be required to forfeit his plane, but the trial judge declined.
The state appealed that decision, and the Alaska Court of Appeals ruled in 2017 in the state’s favor. The Appeals judges sent the case back to the trial court, which again refused to order the plane’s forfeiture, citing the U.S. Constitution’s excessive fines clause.
The state again appealed, and in 2022, a full decade after the original crime, the Court of Appeals partially ruled in the state’s favor. 
The appeals court ordered additional proceedings by the trial court, but both Jouppi’s attorneys and state prosecutors instead asked the Alaska Supreme Court to take up the issue, which it did last year before issuing a written opinion in April.
“We hold, as a matter of law, that the owner of the airplane failed to establish that forfeiture would be unconstitutionally excessive,” wrote Justice Jude Pate on behalf of the court, which ruled unanimously in the state’s favor.
Pate and the court said that Alaska legislative debates showed that state lawmakers placed a high priority on punishments for bootleggers, and thus the seizure of an airplane was not excessive, even though a relatively small amount of beer was involved.
“Alcohol abuse in rural Alaska leads to increased crime; disorders, such as alcoholism; conditions, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; and death, imposing substantial costs on public health and the administration of justice. Within this context, it is clear that the illegal importation of even a six-pack of beer causes grave societal harm,” the ruling states. “This factor strongly suggests that the forfeiture is not grossly disproportional.”
In their request for the U.S. Supreme Court to examine the case, Jouppi’s attorneys argue that the federal justices should decide whether courts should consider the seriousness of an offense in abstract, or if they should take into account a specific defendant’s circumstances.
The Alaska Supreme Court “examined the gravity of the defendant’s offense at a stratospheric level of abstraction,” they argue, when justices should have taken into account the circumstances.
The Alaska justices relied on a federal decision from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Jouppi’s attorneys note, but Alaska is within the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Judges for the 9th Circuit have considered the Excessive Fines clause of the Constitution and concluded that it is critical to “review the specific actions of the violator rather than by taking an abstract view of the violation.”
Because of those two differing interpretations of the Constitution, Jouppi’s attorneys say, the case is ripe for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider.
No date has been set for a court conference to determine whether Jouppi’s case will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
If the court declines to consider his case, the Alaska Supreme Court decision will stand.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/supremecourtoct92024_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 20:57:10.422624

(Ciattarelli photo by Amanda Burns/Spadea photo by Hal Brown)New Jersey Republicans say radio talk show host and failed gubernatorial candidate Bill Spadea’s return to the airwaves may risk the GOP’s chance to win the governor’s race in November.
Spadea, who resumed his morning talk show on New Jersey 101.5 on Tuesday, prefaced his return by saying he will not endorse Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s gubernatorial bid. Spadea was one of three men Ciattarelli defeated in June’s GOP primary.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) said he’s concerned that Spadea’s on-air presence will be a “total drain on the Republican Party.” Bergen did not support Spadea’s campaign for governor.
“It’s less about the act of not endorsing Jack,” Bergen told the New Jersey Monitor. “It’s a lack of support for Republicans, the Republican Party, and a Republican gubernatorial candidate in general.”
Former state Sen. Ed Durr is a Republican who briefly campaigned for the GOP nomination for governor before dropping out of the race in March. When Durr ended his gubernatorial campaign, he said he did so to boost Spadea’s chances. Now, he said he wants to see Spadea work to elect Ciattarelli.
Durr joked that Spadea may have his eye on running for governor again in four years, and to do that, “he needs to get Jack out of the way.”
“He’s actually actively participating and campaigning against him, and I think that’s shameful,” Durr said.
Spadea took a break from hosting his four-hour morning show in January amid complaints from some of his GOP rivals, including Ciattarelli, that New Jersey 101.5 was providing Spadea with an improper campaign advantage. His show on Tuesday was light on politics, though he did take a jab at Republicans who supported a Democratic push to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain New Jersey driver’s licenses. Ciattarelli has recently said that if elected, he would ban issuing licenses to undocumented drivers, though in 2021, he expressed support for the idea.
“Criminal aliens are rampant among us, sneaking in to get a driver’s license because some weak Republicans — you know who — and complicit Democrats, you also know who, allow this and push for it,” Spadea said Tuesday.
Bergen, who is seeking reelection in November, stressed he didn’t want to overstate one person’s significance, but said Spadea’s anti-Ciattarelli messaging bothers him because Bergen believes the governor’s race may be won by a “tiny amount of votes.”
“The only way that we won’t get what we want here is if we choose not to put the full effort forward to do it,” Bergen said. “And someone like Bill Spadea — or replace his name with anybody else that’s going to work to disrupt that or complicate that — I have a problem with at this time.”
Ciattarelli is facing Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill in November in the closely watched election, one of just two gubernatorial races nationwide this fall. The two are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who can’t seek a third term in November.
While Sherrill is leading in the polls, Republicans note that many poll respondents remain undecided. Ciattarelli came within three points of unseating Murphy in 2021 despite polls showing Murphy with a much larger lead.
Spadea on Friday said he would not back Ciattarelli because Ciattarelli is “wrong for New Jersey.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)State and local education officials welcomed students back to school by announcing more than $111.3 million in land investment revenue will be distributed to schools for the 2025-2026 school year — the largest ever yearly distribution in the state program’s history. 
“I’m proud to share that the Permanent State School Fund has grown from about $50 million in 1994 to $3.7 billion today,” Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks said during a news conference Tuesday at Whittier Elementary School in Salt Lake City. 
“This remarkable growth is a result of careful stewardship, prudent administration of trust lands and investment assets, and the foresight of those who established the trust system to support Utah’s education programs now and for years to come,” he said. 
The record $111.3 million distribution comes after Utah voters last year approved a constitutional amendment, Amendment B, which increased the amount that can be distributed from the Permanent State School Fund, an endowment created at statehood to support public schools. 
Approved by voters, Amendment B changed the Utah Constitution to increase the limit of the annual distributions from the fund to public schools from 4% to 5% of the fund. Last year, before the amendment, schools received about $106 million under the 4% distribution cap. 
Amendment B

That 1% change, however, means “beginning in the fall of 2026, schools will have access to even more resources to support students in the classroom, while the fund itself continues to grow for future generations,” Oaks said. “Amendment B helps us to better meet the needs of children today without sacrificing the needs of future students.”
The $111.3 million in LAND Trust funds will support more than 647,000 students in 1,019 schools statewide, distributed on a per-pupil basis, according to the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office. 
“Utah’s School LAND Trust Program is unlike anything else in the nation,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Molly Hart. “While other states have school trust lands, Utah has set the gold standard in managing these assets into a $3.7 billion Permanent State School Fund that directly improves education outcomes and learning in every K-12 public school throughout Utah.”
Hart said she’s personally seen how the annual distribution has grown — from $29 million when she first arrived in Utah in 2012 to $111 million for this year’s distribution.

She called that “simply remarkable.” 
“What makes this program so successful and powerful is that the decisions are made locally by school community council members and land trust councils that are made up of principals and teachers and parents and grandparents who know their students best,” Hart said. “This ensures that every single dollar is strategically invested where it will make the greatest impact.”
Utah — one of the fastest growing states that’s also known for large families — struggles to keep pace with education needs. For the 2026 fiscal year, roughly 38% of the state’s $30.8 billion budget went toward public and higher education, according to the state budget. 
However, the state consistently ranks among the lowest in the nation for per-pupil spending. 
Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Elizabeth Grant told Utah News Dispatch the School LAND Trust program makes a “huge difference” by helping provide much-needed funding for schools. 
“Utah schools are very good at making due with what they have, the funding that they get,” she said. “So we use the dollars well.”

How does Utah’s school land trust system work?
Four agencies make up Utah’s School and Institutional Trust System. The Trust Lands Administration manages about 3.3 million acres of trust lands in Utah, granted by Congress at statehood in 1896 with the requirement that revenue earned from the sale or lease of the land be placed into permanent endowment for public schools. The revenue is generated from activities like energy development, real estate and grazing. 
The School LAND Trust program, housed in the State Board of Education, distributes annual investment earnings directly to local schools and empowers communities to decide how best to meet their needs through land trust councils that decide how to spend the money. 
The Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office is made up of an independent team of investors tasked with investing the revenue in the Permanent State School Fund to grow the endowment. And the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office ensures the fund’s beneficiaries’ interests — primarily school children — are protected and represented.

How much are schools getting?
Alpine School District — Utah’s most populated — got the biggest distribution, more than $13 million. Davis School District got $10.6 million; Granite and Jordan school districts received more than $8.7 million each; Nebo School District got more than $6.6 million; and Washington District got $5.6 million. Those are just some of the top earners due to their large school populations. 
Salt Lake City School District received more than $3 million in this year’s distribution for more than 19,000 students. Included in that disbursement, Whittier Elementary in Salt Lake City got more than $77,000. 
As part of Tuesday’s celebrations, Oaks presented Whittier Elementary Principal Vanessa Jordan with an oversized check. 
Whittier Elementary school community councils chose to use the $77,000 to support building literacy skills for young students. 
“This year, our land trust funds will provide funding for a part-time certified teacher (and a) paraprofessional who will both support literacy intervention for kindergarten, first grade, and second grade students,” Jordan said. 
Here are some more examples of how schools across the state plan to use their distributions this year, according to state officials: 

Desert Canyons Elementary in Washington County School District plans to use the funds to hire and train paraprofessionals who support reading and math instruction. 
Canyon View Middle in Emery County School District is looking to provide specialized literacy-focused teacher training, technology to identify learning gaps, and an instructional coach. 
Sky View High in Cache County School District intends to expand access to concurrent enrollment, AP classes, and ACT prep with an aim of raising graduation rates and boosting college readiness.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar has run into roadblocks in a bid to see documents he said he’s entitled to review — including pushback from a fellow commissioner who does not want to “burden” NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest energy provider.
Molnar, most recently elected in November 2024, is seeking records in two separate matters before the Public Service Commission.
He wants records related to an internal investigation into allegations he’s been “unprofessional” in his conduct.
Molnar also wants to see NorthWestern Energy contracts related to wildfire mitigation. He said he wants to ensure the utility does not inflate those costs or overcharge customers.
The requests for information by Molnar follow the 2025 approval of House Bill 490, a wildfire mitigation bill.
Separately, they also follow his own announcement in July that the PSC had hired an outside firm for as much as $10,000 to investigate complaints against him in a case that’s since made its way to the Governor’s Office.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he had a spat with a utility official over his access to the wildfire mitigation contracts.
He said he requested the monopoly company file a motion for protection if it considers any of the information in the contracts to be a “trade secret.”
If granted, such protection would allow commissioners to view the documents but require them to guard the information from public disclosure.
However, in an email obtained by the Daily Montanan Commissioner Annie Bukacek said the Public Service Commission doesn’t have the capacity to review the information Molnar requested.
In the email to the associate general counsel for NorthWestern, Bukacek also said she doesn’t want to add too much work for the utility.
“His (Molnar’s) requests add to your time and therefore the cost of NorthWestern doing business if you have to file a motion for protection of proprietary information,” Bukacek wrote. “I want to make it clear that this commissioner does not support the added burden of Commissioner Molnar’s request. I am not asking for a response from you.”
Conduct the people’s business ‘in the light of day’
Regarding the internal investigation, Molnar has admitted he might lack finesse in his communication at times but has said the concerns raised were better addressed with a conversation than a costly bill to taxpayers.
The PSC also hired a law firm at a rate of $250 an hour.
However, in a complaint to Gov. Greg Gianforte, Commissioner Jennifer Fielder said Molnar is undermining the investigation, and she requested the governor suspend Molnar including for threats of retaliation — an allegation his lawyer has described as “inflammatory.”
Fielder sent the letter on behalf of the PSC “response team” investigating the allegations. In Montana, the governor has the authority to remove a member of the Public Service Commission.
But Molnar has said the accusation he’ll retaliate is confusing.
“I don’t know who brought the complaint yet. I don’t know what I’m accused of. I don’t know who the witnesses are,” he said. “How do I take retribution?”
Molnar also said Fielder wrote him a letter that said his press conference about the investigation could be considered retaliation.
“I said, ‘How is holding a press conference decrying the lack of due process retaliation?” Molnar said.
In a response to the governor, Molnar’s lawyer said Gianforte should have immediately rejected the complaint by Fielder.
Molnar also said he has been denied in his attempt to learn more about it. He learned of the complaint Fielder filed only after general counsel for the governor provided it.
A policy manual identifies the positions typically on the PSC “response team,” including the president.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he wanted to know who is part of the “response team” handling his investigation and how the complaint to the governor came about.
In an email last Tuesday from the law firm the PSC hired to provide legal advice in the investigation, lawyer Amy Christensen requested Molnar’s lawyer, Matthew Monforton, ask his client to “discontinue” asking PSC staff for information regarding the complaint to the governor.
Wednesday, Monforton told Christensen her directive was “as misguided as it is improper.”
“Commissioner Molnar was duly elected by the people — not appointed by you, not beholden to your ‘Response Team,’ and certainly not subject to your attempts to muzzle him,” Monforton wrote.
Monforton said Molnar has the authority and constitutional obligation to access documents, he won’t be subject to “procedural gamesmanship,” and he will fulfill his elected mandate to ensure “the people’s business is conducted in the light of day, not in the shadows you prefer.”
“Let us be crystal clear about what you are defending: a clandestine complaint dispatched to the governor seeking the suspension of a duly elected official,” Monforton said.
In an email Tuesday, PSC Executive Director Alana Lake said the agency has not yet heard from the Governor’s Office about its complaint, a request Gianforte “take action to allow the investigation to move forward in a lawful manner.”
However, Lake said such requests take time to review “and undergo careful consideration.”
Lake said she could not share details of how the “response team” decided to submit a complaint to the governor given confidentiality requirements in policy, but she said it is “working diligently to ensure the investigation can proceed in a lawful and fair manner.”
The PSC has a work session scheduled Wednesday on the complaint.
‘Why is this even private?’
In the 2025 session, the Montana Legislature adopted HB 490, which requires certain entities such as electric cooperatives and utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans and receive some protection against civil liability for wildfire damages.
The bill requires mitigation plans to include information about inspections and maintenance programs, estimated costs of improvements and upgrades, and other information.
The PSC is charged with approving NorthWestern Energy’s plan. The bill said plans can be approved if they are found to be “in the public interest” and reasonably balance implementation costs with risks of potential wildfire.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he wants to understand the actual wildfire mitigation costs, having heard estimates of anywhere from $7 million to $70 million.
He said one way to find out is to look at how much NorthWestern Energy is spending on vegetation management currently, including with its own crews.
Molnar said if he can see how much they have spent in the last couple of years, he will understand how much is fair for the PSC to approve in any upcoming case.
“Why is this even private? My god. You’re cutting grass. You’ve been doing it forever,” Molnar said. “From the day you became a utility, you’ve been trimming around your power lines.”
He said NorthWestern Energy told him he could view the documents on site, but he said he wanted to distribute copies to other commissioners. So he said he requested the utility send the documents to him — either email them as a public record or ask for an order of protection.
“They’re so used to having their own way,” Molnar said.
In an email obtained by the Daily Montanan, Bukacek said she disagreed with the “tone, tenor and abject idiocy” expressed by Molnar in his meeting with NorthWestern. She also said she did not believe HB 490 requires NorthWestern to provide the information Molnar requested.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he wants to see the information to do his job as a regulator — unlike Bukacek, he said.
“If there was such a thing as treason in the Public Service Commission, she would be saying, ‘I regret I have but one life to live for the utilities that I regulate,’” Molnar said.
On Aug. 25, NorthWestern filed a motion requesting an order of protection for the contracts, arguing public disclosure would harm its ability to negotiate with vendors and get the best deals for its customers.
The PSC has yet to take action on the motion, but Molnar said he would not fight a protective order.
At the PSC meeting Tuesday, energy transition engineer Nick Fitzmaurice with the Montana Environmental Information Center also expressed interest in ensuring customers don’t pay too much for wildfires.
Fitzmaurice said the law gives the PSC the authority to appoint a “technical master” with expertise to review the wildfire mitigation plan, and it should do so for a “robust review.”
“This will be essential to protect Montanans from the risks of utility-sparked wildfire and to ensure we are not on the hook for damages should NorthWestern’s measures be insufficient to prevent the utility’s infrastructure from igniting a wildfire,” Fitzmaurice said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Molnar1-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-09-02 20:57:10.422624

Some cities are ramping up efforts to ticket and tow vehicles that shelter homeless Californians.


For months, cities around the state have ramped up enforcement against people sleeping in tents on the street. Now, some are focusing on a new target: People who live in vehicles. 
Wayne Gardiner, 58, watched his home of 20 years roll onto the back of a flatbed tow truck in San Jose on a recent Monday afternoon. Then he realized he’d forgotten something inside.
He threw open compartments in the bottom of the RV as fast as he could, looking for the pressure-washing tools he uses for cleaning jobs to make extra money. As the RV rose up onto the truck, about to head off to a junk yard, Gardiner found the black backpack full of tools and pulled it out. 
Then he stood back with his rottweiler, Buddy, and some of his possessions in green trash bags at his feet, and watched the truck drive away. He held his emotions in check.
“If I get myself involved with that, I’ll be a wreck,” Gardiner said. “I gotta let it go.”
San Jose is towing vehicles from different areas of the city in a new effort to rid the streets of lived-in vehicles. Last month, it started clearing its largest homeless encampment – a makeshift city in Columbus Park, where Gardiner and hundreds of other people had been sleeping in cars, RVs and tents. 
San Francisco passed a new policy this summer banning large vehicles from parking on any city street for more than two hours — effectively making it illegal to live in an RV on the street. 
Even smaller cities, including Carlsbad outside of San Diego, and San Mateo in the Bay Area, have adopted new policies targeting people living in cars and RVs. 
The issue has attracted the attention of state legislators as well. Assembly Bill 630, which cleared another legislative hurdle Friday, would make it easier for certain cities to dispose of RVs parked on their streets. 
“We have stories from people who have inoperable RVs that are parked in their neighborhoods, under freeways, that they know are ground-zero for drugs, for prostitution rings, for other criminal activities that are happening there,” said the bill’s author, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat. “So what we’re trying to do is address this issue head-on.”
The push comes as rows of RVs and lived-in cars line streets in cities across the state, frustrating voters and creating issues with trash, waste water and traffic visibility. The number of lived-in vehicles on San Francisco’s streets has risen over the past year — from 474 in July 2024 to 612 in June 2025, even as the number of tents dropped from 319 to 165, according to the city’s count.
Vehicle homelessness can be more difficult for cities to manage than tent encampments. People often are reluctant to give up the safety and security of their RV or car in exchange for a temporary shelter bed or short-term housing. And many cities have nowhere to store RVs, and nowhere for them to park legally.

Advocates for the rights of unhoused Californians say doling out punishment to deal with the issue will make the homelessness crisis worse. When cities tow lived-in cars and RVs, their owners often can’t get them back because they can’t pay the towing and storage fees, said Eleana Binder, public policy director for GLIDE, which serves San Franciscans living in homelessness and poverty. They end up with nowhere else to go.
“It does increase street homelessness, because people are right on the edge,” she said. “For a lot of people, a vehicle is their only asset, their last step before street homelessness.”
Tickets and tows
Ordinances that regulate homeless encampments often target people sleeping in tents, not vehicles. As a result, police have used parking ordinances to try to clear vehicle encampments by giving tickets and either towing or threatening to tow. But that approach doesn’t take into account the fact that the cars and RVs are people’s homes. 
In some places, new policies that specifically address people living in cars and RVs try to address that problem by providing services as well as tickets and tows.
Gardiner, who watched the city of San Jose tow his home, was luckier than many. The city paid him $2,000 for his RV, as part of a pilot program intended to convince people to give up their vehicles and move indoors. He also got a free hotel room, where the city told him he could stay for up to a year.
Gardiner was one of several hundred people living in San Jose’s largest encampment — a sprawling collection of RVs, cars and tents scattered across a rutted, dirt field in Columbus Park and spilling onto surrounding streets. City crews began clearing the camp in August, and have towed 78 vehicles and moved 128 people indoors, according to the city.
The city estimates 370 people lived at Columbus Park when the operation started, but advocates say it was more. And not everyone has been offered the $2,000 buy-back program, a motel stay or other help. 
Valerie Vallejos, who lives in her van at Columbus Park while she studies cosmetology at San Jose City College, said she was visiting her children in Stockton when outreach workers came to the park offering people services. Now she’s trying to get on the list, hoping to get a housing placement or at least a reprieve from threats of towing. So far, she’s had no luck. 
“I’m going to keep coming back out until I get something,” she said. “It’s my only option. What else can I do?”
San Jose is cracking down in other places, too. Officials launched a pilot program earlier this year that bans oversized and lived-in vehicles in certain parts of the city. The city first posts signs and puts up flyers warning people to move their vehicles, then tows if people don’t move. Since January, the city has towed 19 RVs and trailers and 45 other vehicles, according to its online dashboard. But many vehicles return after the enforcement blitz. To date, the city has completed enforcement in 38 “tow-away zones,” where there were a total of 1,175 cars and RVs. Ninety days after that enforcement, 671 vehicles had returned to those locations.

It’s kind of scary, you know,” said Vallejos. “It’s just sad. It’s just sad.” Photo by Florence Middleton for CalMatters
“It’s a start,” said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, who acknowledged that towing won’t magically make street homelessness disappear. But he said even forcing RVs to move temporarily can help mitigate the problems the city has seen in long-standing encampments, such as methamphetamine labs, fires and the accumulation of dilapidated, abandoned vehicles.
“This is about providing relief to neighbors and small businesses that have had permanent RV encampments for years on end,” Mahan said.
Since the beginning of the year, San Jose has enforced three “tow-away zones” in the blocks around Barnard Avenue where 51-year-old Esmeralda Herrera lives in a parked trailer with her elderly dog, Kiba. She lost her job as a janitor for the Santa Clara County school district during the COVID-19 pandemic, and then a rent increase drove her out of her apartment.
Herrera is on a waitlist for affordable housing, but she hasn’t seen any progress, she said. In the meantime, Herrera said she bounces all over the city, moving to a new block every time the police threaten to tow her trailer. She’s afraid to leave for job interviews, because she worries that when she gets back, the trailer and her beloved dog will be gone. 
“I don’t know what I would do,” she said. “I don’t want to be in the street.”

‘Public road is not permanent housing’
San Francisco is set to begin enforcing its new RV parking rules this fall. Like San Jose, it plans to pay people to give up their RVs. In addition, people can get a temporary reprieve from towing if they agree to work with a case manager on a housing plan. But only people who have been on the city’s radar since May 2025 are eligible.
“I’m really worried that people are going to end up slipping through the cracks of the permit program, or losing their permit and getting towed,” Binder said. “And for so many people, getting towed means ending up on the streets. That’s my biggest fear: That we’ll see people suffering and more people ending up on the street that weren’t before and don’t have to be.”
In March, Carlsbad expanded its camping ban to include sleeping in vehicles on public property — an infraction that carries a $100 penalty for a first offense, a $200 penalty for a third offense, and a $500 penalty for subsequent offenses. Since the change, the city has issued 34 vehicle camping citations and 77 oversized vehicle parking citations, and towed 12 vehicles, said Mandy Mills, the city’s director of housing and homeless services.
The city received a $3 million state grant to help people living in vehicles move indoors, both by paying for temporary housing subsidies and funding the salaries of two outreach workers to connect people with housing. 
In San Mateo, sleeping in a vehicle on public streets has been illegal since the 1990s. But it wasn’t enforced. In June, City Council voted to start giving people tickets after they refused two offers of shelter.
“The public road is not permanent housing,” said City Manager Alex Khojikian. 
Gonzalez’s bill was intended to help cities like San Mateo clean up their streets. The bill cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee on Friday with a last-minute amendment that limits its scope to Alameda and Los Angeles counties. 
The bill would give cities in those counties more freedom to dispose of abandoned or inoperable RVs. Under current law, a city can trash abandoned RVs valued at $500 or below, but anything more valuable is sold at auction. Someone else can buy that RV and return it to the street, Gonzalez said. 
Gonzalez’s bill would raise that threshold to $4,000, allowing cities to more easily junk RVs and get them off the street for good.

You have to take the deal because they’re gonna take it anyways,” he said. “I have to just let it go.” Photo by Florence Middleton for CalMatters
While Gonzalez says his legislation wouldn’t target RVs in which people are currently living, the bill doesn’t define what makes a vehicle “abandoned.” Opponents, including the California Public Defenders Association, worry that will allow cities to tow too broadly, and remove much-needed shelter from California’s homeless population. 
A separate piece of legislation, Senate Bill 692, would have lowered a different threshold cities have to meet before they can tow “abandoned or inoperable” vehicles. The bill, by Oakland Democratic Sen. Jesse Arreguín, is dead for this year, but may move forward again next year, as Arreguín says he will continue to work with stakeholders on amendments.
In the meantime, in San Jose, Herrera will continue bouncing around the city’s streets with her dog.

In a decision that drew immediate pushback, the Montana Public Service Commission voted unanimously Tuesday against declaring the constitution requires it to consider the adverse impacts of climate change in its work.
The PSC also disagreed it must consider climate in a set of statutes outlined in a petition filed in February 2024 by more than 40 Montana businesses and organizations.
For one thing, the order said making such a declaration would exceed the authority of the Public Service Commission. It said the PSC exercises powers granted by the Montana Legislature, and it is “an administrative agency.”
“It is well established that the Montana Constitution does not allow administrative agencies to issue declarations interpreting the Constitution,” the order said.
The decision elicited quick criticism from the Montana Environmental Information Center and other organizations that petitioned the PSC to consider climate costs including health detriments in its regulation of gas and electric utilities.
“It’s frustrating that this process has dragged on for so long at the PSC just for it to continue avoiding its legal obligation to consider climate change,” said Nick Fitzmaurice, MEIC energy transition engineer.
He said the Montana Constitution is clear, and the state Supreme Court decision in Held vs. Montana “reaffirmed that our right to a clean and healthful environment includes a right to a stable climate.”
He said the MEIC and its fellow petitioners would be exploring their options for how to ensure the PSC “upholds its obligation to protect customers and their utility bills” by considering climate change.
The Supreme Court affirmed in December 2024 that Montanans have a constitutional right to “a clean and healthful environment” in the historic Held decision.
The majority found a law limiting analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during environmental reviews violates the Montana Constitution’s right to a clean environment and stopped the state from acting on it.
But PSC chief legal counsel Lucas Hamilton said that doesn’t mean Public Service Commissioners can make the declarations the MEIC and others want them to make.
Hamilton said “a long line” of Montana Supreme Court cases says that constitutional questions are properly answered by district courts, not administrative officers, like the PSC.
And the right to a clean and healthful environment isn’t the only right that comes up in utility cases, Hamilton said.
“The right to a clean and healthful environment appears alongside other, equally important inalienable rights in the Montana Constitution,” the order said.
For example, Hamilton said Montanans also have the “right to pursue life’s basic necessities,” and the PSC handles questions that address multiple rights.
“In the context of utility service, utilities often provide the means for pursuing life’s basic necessities, right? This is water service. This is sewer service. Heat and light that keeps life going on in a cold state like Montana in certain months of the year.”
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, including NorthWestern Energy.
The groups calling on the PSC to consider the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions had argued it has “the most consequential role” on climate impacts given it could promote or discourage investments in fossil-fuel infrastructure.
The groups argued that taking climate into consideration would benefit customer bills, help children who suffer from the effects of bad air, support businesses, such as ski hills, and boost the Montana economy and recreation culture.
In a statement provided by the MEIC, Bridger Bowl Ski Area’s Hiram Towle said the PSC’s decision “further delays a true financial analysis of energy in Montana.”
“As a business responsible for stewarding natural resources, we prioritize protecting the land and maintaining stable operations for current and future generations,” said Towle, general manager. “Climate change and its impact on utility affordability, reliability, and the environment, poses a serious threat.”
In a statement, lawyer Barbara Chillcott, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, said the PSC should meet its responsibility to the public including the safety of children from wildfires, floods and drought.
“The PSC lists its functions as ensuring ‘ratepayers have continued access to utility services that are affordable, reliable, and sustainable for the long-term,’” Chillcott said. “By its own definition, the commission must take a hard look at how any of its decisions can help blunt the worsening effects of climate-fueled hardships that Montanans are suffering.”
At the meeting, PSC President Brad Molnar and Commissioner Annie Bukacek praised staff for their work on the order — for “brilliant” work and “arduous” effort, Bukacek said.
Molnar said he appreciated the tightly written order by staff, especially because he believes the decision will end up in court.
“I will remind all that this is one step,” Molnar said.
The group had also requested the PSC adopt rules to consider climate costs in the future, and that portion of its petition is pending.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-09-02 19:57:11.552465

(Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries photo)Hunters and competitive shooters will get a break on a variety of purchases this weekend during the Second Amendment Weekend Sales Tax Holiday, which runs Friday through Sunday.
Items that qualify for a break on sales taxes are firearms, ammunition and specified hunting supplies, including archery items, hunting apparel and certain types of knives, according to the Louisiana Department of Revenue (see all exemptions). Binoculars, hearing protection, range finders, decoys, hunting stands and blinds also qualify.   
The tax exemption only applies to consumer firearm purchases and not commercial or business transactions. The break also doesn’t apply to animal feed, hunting dogs, off-road vehicles and vessels such as airboats, which were allowed under previous versions of the sales tax holiday.
All sales tax holidays were suspended in 2018 when Louisiana was dealing with a budget shortfall. The return of the 2nd Amendment Sales Tax Holiday last year ended that reprieve, but lawmakers have refused to add any more exemptions.  
Louisiana first approved a 2nd Amendment tax break in 2009 and most recently amended its guidelines in 2023.
An annual back-to-school sales tax holiday was proposed in this year’s legislative session, but it was never brought up for consideration in committee. 
Louisiana previously offered a sales tax holiday for hurricane preparedness, but it also predated the seven-year pause on all such suspensions in 2018. 
The liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy issued a research brief in July that found sales tax holidays will cost states a combined $1.7 billion in lost revenue this year. It called the incentive “poorly targeted and too temporary to meaningfully change the regressive nature of a state’s tax system.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shotgun_Shooting1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 19:57:11.552465

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) In the 15 years since the Jordan River Commission was established, the river that cuts through Salt Lake County has undergone a major transformation. 
What started as a scattered trail system through a weak riparian ecosystem, interrupted by tracts of industrial land, is now a 50 mile paved trail that spans much of the Wasatch Front. More than 25 new access and portage ramps have been constructed for boaters, while the Legacy Nature Preserve offers about 2,000 acres of protected habitat. 
Someone can now ride a bike from Provo to Ogden, spanning three counties and 16 towns, while the Jordan River Water Trail allows boaters to access most of the river, which stretches from Utah Lake to Farmington Bay. 
“Great cities have great rivers,” said Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson. “And I’m proud of this river and the cities in my county that have stepped up.”

Wilson spoke during a media event Friday, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Jordan River Commission, and kicking off September’s Get to the River festival, a monthlong celebration that includes a beer garden at the Fisher Mansion, educational lectures, nature walks, art exhibits and more. Events are hosted from Saratoga Springs to North Salt Lake. 
Despite the progress, sections of the Jordan River Trail continue to be a hotbed for homeless encampments, drug activity and environmental degradation, prompting Salt Lake City Police to issue a partial closure this year to address public safety concerns. That closure was lifted in July, though officers are still patrolling sections of the trail in Salt Lake City.

The Jordan River Commission started in 2010 with an agreement among local stakeholders and governments — now, more than 40 partners have signed on, including local, state and federal agencies, businesses, nonprofits and all 16 cities and three counties along the river, a major milestone for the commission. 
“More communities signed on, more partners joined in and the progress went faster than anyone could have imagined,” said Cory Rushton, a former West Valley City councilmember and former Jordan River Commission governing board chair.
That progress is on display at the Legacy Nature Preserve, an effort spearheaded in part by the Nature Conservancy along the river in North Salt Lake, Wood Cross and Bountiful. The 2,000-acre preserve was once an industrial area, littered with debris and trash and criss-crossed by access roads. 
Crews removed more than 9,000 tires when cleaning up the site, which had been used as erosion control. 
Now, the area is returning to its original state — a lush riparian corridor lines the river and the preserve’s ponds and wetlands, providing habitat for birds and other animals. The preserve is closed to the public, but boaters can experience it from the river. 
“All of these different habitats allow an amazing assortment of birds and other wildlife to use the legacy preserve as a place to rest, nest and migrate through,” said Andrea Nelson, a community engagement manager for The Nature Conservancy in Utah. 
The preserve is just one example of the river corridor’s transformation over the last 15 years which, according to Don Shelton, is a result of the Jordan River Commission’s dedication to its mission. 
“It’s just remarkable to me what has been able to be accomplished by a group that does not have any land use authority, does not have any statutory authority, but has persuasion, vision and persistence,” said Shelton, a South Jordan councilmember and current Jordan River Commission governing board chair.

Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat, speaks in front of former CDC employees and allies at the Georgia State Capitol on Sept. 2, 2025. Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in turmoil following the ouster of the agency’s director, a series of high-profile resignations, and an attack on its headquarters that killed a police officer, said former CDC staff Tuesday.
The former employees, including ex-deputy director for program and science and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry and former director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases Dr. Dan Jernigan — who both resigned Thursday — described the current environment at the CDC as a “death” where science is currently being sidelined by political ideology. Houry and Jernigan joined Georgia House and Senate Democrats at the State Capitol Tuesday to discuss the current climate at the CDC.
“You can almost see this as death by a thousand cuts: we’re cutting staff, we’re cutting resources, we’re undercutting science,” said Jernigan.

Jernigan said during a roundtable discussion before talking to the press that there has been an overall lack of transparency between the Trump administration and the CDC, saying that he has seen a shift in the CDC’s operations. Whereas past administrations, regardless of their political leanings, worked with scientists to let data guide policy, Jernigan said the current approach appears to start with a predetermined ideology and then attempts to find scientific justification to support it.
“I recognize you really can’t get politics completely out of public health. [Public health is] really a priority here. What are you putting first? And we’re asking that science go first before the policy development, and not starting with an ideology and then backing into the science,” Jernigan said.
The former CDC employees also tied the current political climate to the recent shooting at the CDC campus, which they said was fueled by years of misinformation about vaccines. Abby Tighe, who was fired from the CDC in May and is a founding member of Fired But Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and allies, said it’s “tragic to not have a stronger condemnation of this act of violence” and warned that without officials speaking out against the attack, she fears attacks on the scientific community could continue to happen.
“That could look like more attacks, and with the vaccine misinformation being the driver for this, who’s to say that this won’t lead to attacks at pediatricians’ offices or pharmacies or all of these places where vaccines are given and professionals who work in the vaccine space exist,” Tighe said.
CDC employees on Thursday were told they have to return to the office by Sept. 15, according to an email obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, just over a month after nearly 200 rounds of ammunition hit six separate CDC buildings. The building is still being repaired, but Lynda Chapman, chief operating officer who sent the notice, stated in the letter that an “alternative on-campus space” will be provided to those whose office “remains impacted.”
Houry said she left the agency because she “could no longer fight on the inside.” She expressed deep concern over decisions that she said were not being made based on data and science, as well as the loss of talented staff. She said that while she was tasked with sunsetting certain programs during her time, she did her best to archive data so that it could be “resuscitate[d]” if funding is restored.
“If there’s a surveillance system that doesn’t have funding or people, we cannot produce that data. But as we were facing sunsetting a lot of those programs, [we] did what we could to preserve it because we are hopeful that at some point we’ll be able to rebuild our agency,” Houry said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20250902_160405061-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-02 19:57:11.552465

Republican first selectmen are running as challengers in Oxford and Plainfield after losing their party endorsements, one with a twist: The GOP in Plainfield snubbed their incumbent in favor of a Democratic predecessor.
The Democratic primaries are in Bloomfield, Bridgeport, Chester, Hamden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, North Haven, Norwalk, Stamford and Stratford.
The GOP races are in Greenwich, Griswold, Haddam, Oxford, Plainfield, Sterling, Thomaston, Voluntown, Waterbury and Wolcott.
Bridgeport has contests for Democratic nominations for four council seats, including two held by politicians who were targets of elections complaints relating to the absentee ballot scandal in the 2023 mayoral race, Aidee Nieves and Maria Pereira.
Nieves, the council president, was endorsed by the Democratic Town Committee. Pereira is seeking renomination as a challenger.
Warring Democratic factions in the Hartford suburb of Bloomfield are continuing a long-running feud with full slates of endorsed and challenging candidates for council, school board, town plan and zoning commission, and library trustee.
Most of the primaries are for scattered down-ballot offices, not mayor or first selectman. There are no mayoral primaries this year in Stamford or New Haven, the two largest cities with mayoral elections in November.
In the eastern Connecticut town of Plainfield, Republicans endorsed Paul Sweet, a former Democratic first selectman, over Kevin M. Cunningham, the Republican incumbent. Cunningham is waging a primary against Sweet.
Cunningham is facing complaints of mismanagement.
The Day of New London reported a week ago that the local police union passed a vote of no confidence in the offices of the first selectman and finance department over repeated errors in paychecks.
The neighboring communities of Sterling and Voluntown also have GOP primaries for open first selectmen seats. Myron “Jack” Joslyn, the endorsed candidate in Sterling, is challenged by Kimberly Gunn and Frank M. Bood. Brian Muschiano is the endorsed candidate in Voluntown, challenged by Christopher A. Wilson.
In Oxford, a Naugatuck Valley community hard hit by flooding a year ago, First Selectman George Temple lost the GOP endorsement to his former protege, Jeffrey Luff.
Hamden, where Democratic Mayor Lauren Garrett is not running, has a five-way Democratic mayoral primary. The council president, Dominique Baez, is the endorsed candidate. She is challenged by Peter Cyr, Lushonda D. Howard, Walter L. Morton IV, and Adam Sendroff.
There is a two-way race in Norwalk for the Democratic nomination to succeed Mayor Harry Rilling, a Democrat. The council president, Barbara Smyth, is the endorsed candidate; Darlene Young, a council member, is the challenger.
In Wolcott, two Republicans are vying for the right to oppose Thomas G. Dunn, an unaffiliated candidate who has been unopposed in four consecutive races. The endorsed candidate is James Paolino; the challenger, Paul D’Angelo.
In Stratford, two Democrats are seeking the nomination and the right to oppose Republican Mayor Laura Hoydick. The endorsed candidate is David Chess; the challenger, Linda Manos.
Chester’s Democratic first selectwoman, Cynthia Lignar, was endorsed by the her town committee, but faces a primary challenge from Joe Cohen, a public affairs consultant and former Hartford Courant reporter.
Primary day is Tuesday, Sept. 9. Polls will be open from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. 
Hours for early voting generally are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with extended hours of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 2 and Thursday, Sept. 4.

(Photo submitted by the campaign.)The mayor of one of Pennsylvania’s largest cities announced her candidacy for Congress on Tuesday.
Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, said she’s seeking her party’s nomination for the 8th Congressional District in 2026 in an effort to challenge U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-Luzerne).
“I’m running for Congress because people here deserve a lot better than a rich kid, disrespecting our hard work and proud legacy,” Cognetti said in a campaign ad. “We can stand tall against a Washington that takes advantage of working people and make it work for us. People deserve a future they can believe in and a government that works as hard as they do, always.”
Bresnahan was elected to Congress last year by defeating Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright by roughly 1.5 points. The freshman lawmaker is currently one of four GOP incumbents in Pennsylvania that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is aiming to flip in 2026.
Cognetti was elected mayor of Scranton in 2019 as an Independent after Democratic incumbent Mayor Bill Courtright resigned from office after pleading guilty to federal bribery, conspiracy, and extortion charges. Her victory in 2019 made her the first woman elected mayor of Scranton and she secured re-election in 2021 as a Democrat. Earlier this year, she cruised to victory in the Democratic Party primary and is running for re-election in November.
In her campaign launch video, Cognetti also criticized Bresnahan’s stock trades as a member of Congress.
Cognetti is the first Democrat to enter the race in the 8th Congressional District and announced that she has the support of Cartwright, Lieutenant Gov. Austin Davis, and U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-Allegheny).
“By jumping into a congressional race before even wrapping up her re-election bid for mayor, Paige Cognetti is showing voters exactly where her true priorities lie,” National Republican Congressional Committee Spokesman Reilly Richardson said.

(Screen capture from Sarnecki's campaign announcement video)TOPEKA — Businessman Philip Sarnecki said he was weary of Republicans losing Kansas campaigns for governor to Democrats, she he decided to try to fix the problem himself.
He said he was joining a group of candidates seeking the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination that was dominated by “career politicians.” The GOP list included former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson, Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt.
The 2026 campaign will decide who replaces term-limited Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. She’s been governor since defeating Republican Kris Kobach  in 2018. In her 2022 campaign for reelection, she beat Republican Derek Schmidt.
“President Donald Trump won Kansas in a landslide the last three elections, but Republicans keep losing in Kansas,” Sarnecki said in a campaign announcement Tuesday. “That is over. We’re going to win and we’re going to win big.”
Sarnecki, who lives in Johnson County, is retired after 30 years in the financial services industry. He was managing partner of Northwestern Mutual, which had offices in 18 states.
He vowed not to “play by the old political rules. I can’t be bought. And, I refuse to let Democrats rewrite Kansas’ future.”
Sarnecki said that as governor he would support Trump, help create good-paying jobs, lower taxes for individuals and businesses, expand parental rights in education and shrink government red tape so businesses had more opportunity to grow.
In addition, Sarnecki blamed “poor Republican leadership” for high corporate income taxes and property taxes.
He said there wasn’t enough affordable housing for young Kansans. Employers, he said, were irresponsibly advancing diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the workplace.
“This is what the career politicians in Kansas have brought us: Incompetence and losing,” he said.
Democrats running for governor include state Sens. Ethan Corson and Cindy Holscher, both of Johnson County.
“Today’s Democratic leaders are lost souls,” Sarnecki said. “They can’t figure out the difference between illegal immigration and legal immigration. They can’t figure out the difference between criminals and victims of crime.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Philip-Sarnecki-for-governor-1.png,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas public libraries will receive their usual allotments of state funding for the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, a Department of Education attorney told the new State Library Board during its first meeting Tuesday.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed six new members to the board in August and has yet to appoint a seventh and final member. Gubernatorial appointed boards are allowed to meet before receiving Senate approval, and education department attorney Daniel Shults said Tuesday’s meeting was strictly organizational.
The Arkansas State Library is under the umbrella of the Department of Education but operates independently, and the board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries. The new members did not vote on library funding or any other matters and will be able to vote and set policy after being confirmed, Shults said.
Sanders signed a law in April mandating the removal and replacement of the previous State Library Board members, three of whom she had appointed since taking office in 2023. The law required her to call a meeting of the new board by Wednesday at the latest.
The overhaul came after the previous board clashed for more than a year over whether it should withhold funding from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content. Both state and local elected officials have tried to regulate public library leadership, funding and content for the past few years.
Act 903 of 2025 required the seven new board members to draw lots determining how their terms will be staggered, ending between one and seven years from now. Subsequent appointees would serve seven-year terms, the usual length of time library board members serve.
Challenges to public library funding throughout Arkansas meet frustration, some resistance

The six members drew the following terms:

One year for Clay Goff of Beebe
Three years for Sydney McKenzie of Rogers and Jack Fortner of Yellville
Five years for Emmaline Pilkington and Annette Bailey
Seven years for Lynlee McMillan and the board’s to-be-appointed seventh member

The new board unanimously selected Goff as chairman and McKenzie as vice chairman. Goff previously chaired the White County Regional Library System’s governing board for 11 years, and McKenzie is the only previous State Library Board member reappointed so far, having joined the board in January.
McKenzie and Pilkington are both married to Republican members of the state House of Representatives. Fortner is a former Republican representative who served four terms before declining to run for reelection in 2024.
McMillan is Sanders’ director of constituent services. Bailey and her husband are the co-founders of Mountain Home’s Twin Lakes Baptist Church.
Shults and other Department of Education officials led the new board through an overview of its responsibilities and regulations Tuesday.
In response to a question from Fortner, State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat said the board doesn’t “have governing control” over public libraries. Besides funding libraries, the board is also responsible for appointing the State Librarian.
McMillan asked Education Secretary Jacob Oliva what the state’s priorities are for the board. Oliva said literacy is a priority for the department. Sanders’ signature legislation of 2023 was the LEARNS Act, an education system overhaul that included literacy coaches in elementary schools.
“We know that a strong, robust literacy program grounded in phonics, phonemic awareness, fluency and vocabulary leads to better comprehension,” Oliva said. “Libraries can have part of that same conversation if they’re working with their families and their parents and making sure that we have access to a great, rich literacy environment.”
The Senate meets quarterly to confirm gubernatorial appointments, and its most recent meeting was Aug. 15. The State Library Board’s next meeting will be Nov. 14.

They are now voting on new agreements that would get them pay hikes. (Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Thousands of state government and community college employees in Washington are considering a new pact that would secure raises they lost out on in July when state lawmakers did not fund their contract.
Nearly 5,300 members of the Washington Public Employees Association didn’t get a 3% pay hike other state workers received July 1 because they failed to approve their two-year deal in time for lawmakers to account for it in the state budget.
Now, association members are voting on a revised accord that, if ratified and funded by the Legislature next year, would boost their salaries 3% retroactively and provide a year’s worth of back pay.
The ratification vote began Aug. 22 and will end Sept. 14. Union officials said they would wait to see the results before commenting.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The 2025-27 budget funded multiple contracts that provide pay hikes of 3% on July 1 and 2% next July. These agreements contain other salary-related changes including raising the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
But Washington Public Employee Association members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement with the pay hikes last fall. Association negotiators derided the proposal as a pay cut, saying it would not allow worker salaries to keep pace with rising costs. They also warned then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Those affected work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture.
Negotiators for the association and the Office of Financial Management did resume talks last winter and eventually reached a tentative agreement in March containing virtually the same economic terms as those turned down. Union members ratified it April 3, just three weeks before the legislative session ended.
Since session ended, the union bargaining team was engaged in “one of the most difficult negotiation periods” in the association’s history before reaching the tentative agreement now getting voted on, according to a post on the association website.
“While we didn’t win everything we fought for, significant gains were made — and harmful proposals were defeated,” officials wrote online.
State government and community college employees are voting on separate agreements. Both would take effect July 1, 2026, and cover the second year of the biennium. Each offers a path for workers to get the 3% doled out this year plus a 2% wage hike next year.
The primary difference concerns who is eligible to receive back pay.
Under their deal, those working in state government would receive the 3% pay bump awarded in July plus retroactive compensation – even if they are no longer working for the state on July 1, 2026. According to the union, the state wanted to limit back pay to only those employees on the payroll as of July 1, 2026.
But not every community college employee is assured back pay under their tentative deal.
Those employed on July 1, 2026, would receive the 3% bump and retroactive pay. Anyone who is laid off, loses their job due to a disability or retires would also be eligible. But those who leave on their own before the start of the contract would not.
“The bargaining team hoped to secure retroactive funding for everyone,” officials wrote on the union website, “but we ultimately reached a point where the state was unwilling to move.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

Keith Brooks (left) and Education Secretary Jacob Oliva present the LEARNS Act to the House Education Committee on Feb. 28, 2023. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers continued to express concern Tuesday about a newly effective law that prohibits students who don’t meet the state’s third-grade reading standard from being promoted to fourth grade. 
The new provision, which goes into effect this fall, is part of the LEARNS Act, a 2023 law that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system. 
The discussion followed Education Sec. Jacob Oliva’s presentation of 2025 state test scores to a joint meeting of the House and Senate education committees Tuesday. Oliva said students that score a Level 1, the lowest level, during the 2026 assessment will be reviewed but not automatically retained because the law allows for “good-cause exemptions.” Oliva told Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, those exemptions could apply to students with disabilities.
Arkansas’ rising 3rd graders will be first to be held back under new literacy standards

The goal of the review, he said, is to have a discussion about students who have “very limited understanding” in third grade. 
“If they were to go on to fourth grade without significant supports, they’re going to continue to struggle,” Oliva said. 
Options can then be considered, he said, such as enrolling in a summer program, offering high-impact tutoring or testing for a learning disability. Education officials would also consider if the student has already been retained or if they’re an English language learner, he said. 
“There’s a lot of factors that go into making that decision,” Oliva said. “It’s not saying that they automatically have to be retained. That may be the best decision for that child, but what it’s saying is that if a student does get promoted at a fourth grade without demonstrating a high level of understanding in literacy, there’s some provisions that also have to be in place.”
Only 35% of students are reading at grade level, according to the Arkansas Department of Education.
Asked by Sen. Frederick Love, D-Mabelvale, how many students scored a Level 1 in 2025, Oliva estimated around 10,000 students would be at risk. However, he noted that estimate includes students like English language learners, who may be exempt from retention. The goal of the new law, he said, is not to retain all of those students.
Arkansas education overhaul rules still a work in progress, officials say

“We do not intend to add student parking at middle school, that is not the goal of third-grade promotion,” Oliva said. “It’s to make sure that we are identifying skills that need support early, intervening, doing our job to mitigate that number as much as we can.”
In response to Flowers questioning whether each individual student would be reviewed, Oliva said he’s not sure if the education department will be at that level this year. Because it’s a new provision, they’re “still trying to figure that out,” he said. 
Oliva also assured Flowers that the rules have been promulgated and the department is “making sure we can clarify that as much as possible” by sharing information through training and webinars.
Rules implementing this new provision were added to the Right to Read Act Rules, which became effective July 1, 2024. ADE Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford told the Advocate in late July that the department was drafting additional information to assist districts with implementation. 
The intent was to add that information to the Right to Read Act Rules, but the department’s legal team was reviewing the information to determine whether a rule revision was necessary, Salas-Ford said.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)WEST COLUMBIA — More than half of South Carolina’s third- through eighth-grade students still can’t do math on grade level, even as reading scores reached all-time highs, according to state standardized testing data released Tuesday.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver and teachers’ advocates have attributed much of the improvement in reading scores to a shift in how students learn to read. State officials are hoping for similar results in math after launching a training program in the subject this spring.
By 2030, the Department of Education wants three-quarters of all students performing at or above grade level in both subjects. Three districts met that bar in reading: York 4 (Fort Mill), Anderson 4 (Pendleton) and Anderson 1 (Williamston). But none have reached it in math. Fort Mill comes close at 70% proficiency.
The results of SC READY end-of-year tests taken last spring that, overall, 44% of third- through eighth-grade students statewide could do math as expected for their age, while 60% could read on grade level. That’s the highest percentage overall since students began taking SC READY tests 10 years ago, according to department data.
A score of proficient or above indicates a student is ready for the next grade’s work.
“We know that we have challenges in math, and we’re not going to sugarcoat those challenges,” Weaver said.
Improvements in reading
Three years ago, the state began using the LETRS program — short for Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling — to train teachers in phonics, the strategy of sounding out letters and rhyming sounds to teach children how to read. That was a change from “three-cueing,” which teaches children to use context surrounding the word to figure out its meaning.
Every kindergarten through third grade teacher in the state is expected to complete the two-year program by the end of this school year, according to the state education department.
“It’s all part of the big package that has taken a number of years to put together and to align, but now we are beginning to see the dividends of that alignment,” Weaver said during an announcement of the scores at J.C. Lynch Elementary School in Florence 3 (Lake City), which showed big leaps in improvement.
There, the number of students scoring proficient for their grade jumped 10 points to 55% in reading and 13 points to 46% in math.
About half of SC’s 3rd to 8th graders can read on grade level. Math scores are worse.

Reading scores have surpassed those from before the COVID-19 pandemic. This year’s reading scores are the best since students started taking SC READY tests in 2016, according to department data.
In 2021, just 42% of test-takers overall could read on grade level.
“Our reforms are working, and together we will keep pressing toward our 2030 goal, so every child has the opportunity to succeed and thrive,” House Education Chair Shannon Erickson, a Beaufort Republican, said in a statement.
Better reading scores could translate to better scores across the board, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association and an elementary school literacy coach. Reading comprehension skills can help students not just in English class but in cases like parsing out word problems in math, she said.
“Reading is the foundation, really, for everything,” Crews said.
Hopes for improved math scores
Math scores have steadily increased in recent years, but students remain slightly behind where they were in 2019, the last full year of school before the pandemic disrupted learning. All state-standardized testing was suspended in 2020. In 2021, just 37% of students received a score in math showing they were ready for the next grade’s work.
Beginning in January of this year, teachers in 10 of the lowest-performing schools in math started receiving training in best practices. The state also sent math coaches to help students and updated instructional materials, said Abbey Duggins, a state deputy superintendent overseeing academics.
During this fall semester, that will expand to 140 schools, Duggins said. So far, specialized instructors are in about half of those, she said.
“Our goal here in South Carolina is that no kid says, ‘I’m not a math kid,’” Weaver told the state Board of Education during its Tuesday meeting.
Legislators initially spent $10 million on the program, called the Palmetto Math Project, last year. They provided the same amount this year.
Similar to the reading program, which started as a pilot in 2022, the Department of Education will evaluate what works and what doesn’t work in those original districts before expanding the most effective methods statewide, Duggins said.
Math and reading are such different subjects to teach that finding a similar training program to help boost scores has been tricky, Duggins said. The department has settled on OGAP, the Ongoing Assessment Project, which outlines the ways in which students most easily learn different mathematical concepts, Weaver said.
Zearn Math, an online math program with lessons and activities used nationwide, will also expand into South Carolina schools, according to the education department.
The department has also changed the math curriculum to put geometry ahead of algebra, which will introduce students to more concrete ways of learning math before moving into the more abstract realm of algebra, Duggins said.
“If we can just find the way to build in to our teachers’ toolboxes, enhance what they already know about math instruction and take it to the next level, we know that we will start seeing the same results in that math space,” Duggins told the state Board of Education.
What the data says
Older students performed worse than younger ones. Eighth grade students performed the worst in both subjects: 32% of students could do math on grade level, and 56% were reading as expected.
Third graders performed the best. More than 56% of third graders were doing math on grade level, and 62% were reading on level, according to the data.
“That is incredibly concerning to me as a high school teacher, because I know what’s coming for those students when they hit high school,” said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Math skills, especially, tend to build with each class, so a student struggling in one math class is more likely to continue struggling in each of the coming years, Kelly said.
The change in instruction for third graders likely led to the improvement for younger students more than older ones, according to the department. Last year’s third graders were kindergarteners the year teachers began the new training program.
This year, the first kindergarteners whose teachers completed the program entered third grade. Officials are hoping to see scores improve even further as teachers use what they learned in their classrooms, Weaver said.
Fort Mill, which has the state’s lowest poverty rate at 22%, saw the highest reading score in the state, with 82% of students meeting grade level. About 70% of students in the district considered the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, could do math at grade level, according to department data.
The state’s poorest district, McCormick County — where nearly all students live in poverty — saw major gains in its scores. English scores improved by 14%, with 52% on grade level. Math went up nearly 6%, to 26% proficient, according to department data.
That “proves that poverty is not a life sentence — all children have the potential to learn and thrive, and that is exciting,” Senate Education Chair Greg Hembree, a North Myrtle Beach Republican, said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4234-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson announced her candidacy for U.S. Senate Tuesday, hours after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst publicly announced she would not run for reelection in 2026.
In a statement announcing her run, Hinson aligned herself with President Donald Trump, saying she will be the president’s “strongest ally” in the Senate and will work to support his agenda on issues like immigration and border security, supporting Iowa agriculture and “returning common sense to classrooms.”
“The America First agenda is working for Iowans,” Hinson said. “I’m running for Senate because there’s more work to do, and I am prepared to win and deliver.”
Hinson, currently representing Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, has been considered a top GOP contender for the U.S. Senate seat amid speculation and reports on Ernst leaving the race. Ernst officially said she would not run for reelection Tuesday, saying it was “no easy decision” to not seek another term but that she planned to focus and “give back” to her family.

In her announcement to run for the spot, the Republican representative thanked Ernst for her military and public service.
“Service defines Senator Joni Ernst — from serving her country in uniform to fiercely fighting for Iowans in the U.S. Senate,” Hinson said. “Her story — from Red Oak to the Senate, is a powerful example of the American dream. Our country and state are better off because of Joni’s selfless service — I lead a heartfelt thank you from every Iowan.”
There are two other Republicans who are also campaigning to become the GOP Senate nominee — former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, who previously ran as a Libertarian candidate for the state Senate.
Multiple Republican U.S. Senators, including Katie Britt of Alabama, Jim Banks of Indiana and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma endorsed Hinson as she entered the race.
“She’s proudly pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, and is working hard to cut the long-unchecked waste, fraud, and abuse that’s run rampant in Washington,” Banks said in a statement. “There is no doubt she is the conservative fighter we need in the Senate to advance President Trump’s agenda and keep America on the right path.”
Hinson has represented northeast Iowa in the U.S. House for three terms since she defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat, in the 2020 election. Before her time in Congress, Hinson worked as a TV news anchor for Cedar Rapids’ KCRG, in addition to serving in the Iowa House.
Her move to run for Senate means the 2nd Congressional District will be without a Republican incumbent. Multiple Democrats — state Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque,  Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College — have announced their campaigns, but there are currently no Republicans who have entered the field.
Though the 2nd Congressional District is rated as a “solid Republican” seat by the Cook Political Report heading into 2026, Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Hinson shifted to the U.S. Senate race as “her re-election prospects are doomed because Northeast Iowans see that she is more focused on serving billionaires than working for them.”
“Hinson knows what we know: there’s change coming in Iowa, Democrats will compete aggressively to flip this seat, and we will win because Iowans are ready to elect someone who actually puts them first,” Smith said.
But House Republicans’ campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, argued Iowans will elect the eventual GOP nominee in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
“This is simple: Iowa voters trust Republicans to deliver real, commonsense results and have no interest in the Democrats’ radical agenda,” NRCC Spokeswoman Emily Tuttle said in a statement. “This seat will stay red.”
Democrat Bob Krause joins Democratic primary for U.S. Senate
Iowa Democrat Bob Krause has also entered the race for U.S. Senate, ending his campaign for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District.
Krause, the president of the Veterans National Recovery Center and a former state representative, made a video Monday announcing his bid to become the 2026 Democratic nominee for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat. He is joining a crowded primary field — state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage have also announced their campaigns for the position.
But Krause said he was the best candidate for the job because of his background in the state legislature, his work as a regional representative for the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in former President Jimmy Carter’s administration and his military experience.
“For 28 and a half years in the military, I pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic,” Krause said in the video. “Today I see movements towards the ignoring of the Constitution, and I want to change that.”
Krause has run for Senate multiple times before — he sought to become the Democratic nominee in 2010, 2016 and 2022 — though he withdrew from the Democratic primary in 2022 after failing to gather enough signatures to make it onto the ballot. Krause said in a statement he is coming into the race with a “robust network of supporters across the state” from previous election cycles.
In May, Krause announced he was running for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, currently represented by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. In a statement Monday, Krause said he was withdrawing from this race and endorsing Democrat Christina Bohannan for the Democratic nomination.
Bohannan, a former Iowa House member and University of Iowa law professor, was the 1st District Democratic nominee in 2024, a race she lost to Miller-Meeks with 47% of the vote to the incumbent’s 53% after requesting a vote recount. She announced she would run for the position again in June. Krause said in a statement Bohannan has “run before, possesses a strong work ethic and enjoys exceptional name recognition.”
Travis Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care, is also running to become the 1st District Democratic nominee, campaigning as a progressive candidate.

(Photo courtesy of Bernalillo County)In an executive order issued last week, President Donald Trump took aim at states and cities that no longer require people to pay bail to stay out of jail while they await trial. 
Specifically, Trump directed his administration to compile a list of any grants and contracts the federal government has with “cashless bail jurisdictions” that could be suspended or terminated. Cashless bail means judges have the option of releasing someone without having to pay bail so long as they are not dangerous or a flight risk.
New Mexico is likely to appear on that list, as it eliminated cash bail nearly a decade ago.
In interviews with Source NM, criminal justice experts said cash bail disproportionately holds poor people and people of color in jail; the vast majority of people released before their trials don’t go on to commit new crimes; and holding people in jail tends to increase crime, not reduce it.
Jonathan Ibarra, a public defender and president of the New Mexico Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, told Source NM Trump’s executive order is an opening salvo in the administration’s efforts to roll back bail reform across the country, one that is “more likely to punish poor people” because under a cash bail system, if a defendant has enough money, they could pay bail no matter how high a judge set it.
“That was a big problem with how bail was set up: it really became about keeping poor people in jail more than it became about keeping dangerous people in jail,” said Ibarra, a former district court judge.
Paul Guerin, deputy director of the Center for Applied Research and Analysis at the University of New Mexico, told Source the data doesn’t support the president’s assertions about bail reform encouraging defendants on pretrial release to commit more crime “because they know our laws will not be enforced.”
“If jurisdictions like Washington D.C., states like New Mexico or other local cities were required to go back to cash bail, we would see an increase in jail populations, people would stay in jail longer and they would not commit new crimes if we would have released them,” Guerin said.
Scott Hechinger, a civil rights attorney, former public defender and founder and executive director of media education nonprofit Zealous, told Source states and cities across the country that have reduced pretrial incarceration, such as New York, have preserved more people’s freedom, saved money by not incarcerating them and experienced no increase in crime as a result.
“What Trump is doing is just the most recent non-fact-based argument against what I would argue is the most successful criminal justice policy in the last half a century,” Hechinger said.
Ibarra said aside from the executive order being bad policy, as a practical matter he doesn’t know how Trump’s executive order could force New Mexico to reverse bail reform because it’s written into the state Constitution.
The state Supreme Court in 2014 ruled that cash bail violated New Mexicans’ constitutional right to pretrial release. Two years later, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to eliminate cash bail, while still giving judges the power to deny release to provably high-risk defendants.
Lawmakers and prosecutors in 2022 and 2023 proposed legislation that would have required defendants to prove they aren’t too dangerous for pretrial release. The bill ultimately failed after pushback from public defenders and criminal justice advocates who said, if the bill passed, they would challenge its constitutionality.
The bill’s opponents cited findings from researchers at New Mexico’s court system, the Legislature and UNM showing that most people facing felony charges who were released before their trials did not go on to get arrested for a violent crime.
A similar pattern holds in every jurisdiction in the U.S. that has intentionally reduced pretrial incarceration, Hechinger said.
He points to a 2021 meta-analysis of the connection between incarceration and public safety that found that almost every study over the past two decades had reached the same conclusion. 
Pretrial detention, especially of a poor person, can result in someone losing their home, children, job or vehicle, Ibarra said. Holding more people in jail may make the community slightly less dangerous in the very short term, he said, but in the long term, it means more people coming out of jail without the ability to help themselves and with a higher likelihood to then commit crimes. 
“Do we want their lives to have been completely ruined so they don’t have a choice but to go commit more crimes in order to feed themselves or house themselves?” Ibarra said. “Or do we want people to get out and be able to maintain what they had in order to become or remain contributing members of society?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MDC-recruitment-video-screenshot-1024x576.png,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s beleaguered secretary of corrections has resigned.
Gov. Larry Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight that Kellie Wasko delivered the letter announcing her Oct. 20 departure on Tuesday, though the letter is dated Sept. 1.
News of the secretary’s resignation after 3½ years on the job came less than a day after a group of 20 lawmakers in the House of Representatives signed a letter calling on Rhoden to “clean up his Department of Corrections” before a Sept. 23 special session. That’s when lawmakers will be asked to endorse construction of a $650 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Sioux Falls. 
The timing of the lawmaker letter was coincidental and “unfortunate,” Rhoden said.

“She had made up her mind, and she knew what she wanted to do,” the governor said. “She knew that this wasn’t getting better.”
Rhoden added that only one of the letter’s 20 signatories, Howard Republican Rep. Tim Reisch, had called him to express his concerns about Wasko in the past six months.
“I guarantee you, they all have my cell number,” said Rhoden.
The governor added that he had faith in Wasko in spite of criticisms of her management style and a wave of security incidents and controversies since 2023. 
Despite that confidence, Rhoden said he recognizes that Wasko’s resignation will make it easier to convince the Legislature to back the $650 million project.
“You’re always looking for the hurdles that are going to give people a path to ‘no,’ and to remove those hurdles and give them more reasons to say ‘yes,’” Rhoden said. 
Letter authors laud resignation
Reisch, the first lawmaker to call for Wasko’s resignation and a former corrections secretary himself, lauded the news as a step forward as the Legislature ponders a replacement for the oldest parts of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
“I just hope it’s a transition to a better way of doing things,” Reisch said.
None of the 20 lawmakers listed on the letter hold leadership positions in the House.
But House Speaker Jon Hansen, the Dell Rapids Republican now running for governor, said Wasko “needs to be fired” on his campaign’s Facebook page Tuesday morning.
House Speaker Pro Tempore Karla Lems, R-Canton, is Hansen’s gubernatorial running mate. She said she wasn’t asked to sign the letter. Even so, she said Wasko’s leadership is “what I think rises to the top” of her list of concerns about an expensive new prison.
Resignation letter lists accomplishments 
Wasko, a nurse by training who spent years working in Colorado’s correctional system before coming to South Dakota in 2022 as an appointee of then-Gov. Kristi Noem, wrote that she’d spent the past few months discussing her decision with her family.
She’s leaving “to pursue other opportunities,” the letter says.
Tumultuous period at penitentiary culminates in warden’s departure

The two-page document has four paragraphs in total, reserving the bulk of its space for 22 bullet points listing “just a handful” of her accomplishments.
Among them are a 43% increase in correctional officer pay and a decrease in staff vacancies, creating a “comprehensive reentry program”  for inmates leaving state prisons, curing 300 inmates of Hepatitis C, creating an Office of Inspector General to investigate crime behind the walls and a reduction in escapes.
“I have worked diligently for the last 3½ years to improve the Department of Corrections and I know I am leaving it far better than I found it,” the letter says.
It also points to a change in the DOC’s “insolence” and discipline policy, which was “highly controversial” with previous secretaries and ended the practice of placing inmates in disciplinary segregation for talking back to officers.
“It was necessary, and we have successfully corrected the process,” she wrote, noting that a 2022 operations review recommended housing inmates in “the least restrictive environment necessary to maintain safe and secure facilities.”
Critics: New policies made for unsafe facilities
The letter from lawmakers stopped short of demanding Wasko’s resignation – it doesn’t mention her by name – but Reisch said changes like that are why he’s called for her ouster. 
“If inmates know what the rules are and that they’re enforced, the vast majority will comply with them,” Reisch said. “If word gets around that they’re not enforced, that word gets around pretty fast, and security goes by the wayside.”
Reisch said staff assaults are up, based on conversations he’s had with current correctional officers. The DOC’s annual statistical report for 2024 showed assaults on staff at a five-year low, but Reisch said that could be a matter of shifting definitions of assault since Wasko came to lead the agency in 2022. 
“A lot of the definitions can change,” said Reisch, who also suggested that some assaults aren’t logged.
Attorney General Marty Jackley told the Dakota Town Hall podcast in mid-February that his office had more than 100 open assault investigations involving inmates. 










You’re always looking for the hurdles that are going to give people a path to ‘no,’ and to remove those hurdles and give them more reasons to say ‘yes.’


– Gov. Larry Rhoden, about the Wasko resignation's potential impact on legislative support for a prison construction project


Corrections spokesman Michael Winder declined to offer the number of staff assaults to occur thus far in 2025, and said the definition of “assault” has not changed since 2022.
Not all lawmakers saw Wasko’s leadership as a sticking point. Sen. Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, scolded the House members for the letter in a Tuesday interview with South Dakota Searchlight, arguing that it was improper to “inject other issues” into a discussion about replacing a prison he called “inhumane” and “a lawsuit waiting to happen.”
Mehlhaff, who served on the Project Prison Reset task force, said Wasko “has been treated more unfairly than any public official in the state,” noting that she came to the job after a scandal resulting in the removal of top DOC officials under accusations of misconduct and nepotism.
“She did not come on to a DOC that was a well-oiled machine,” Mehlhaff said. “It was a disaster.”
Money questions
Each of the House members who signed the letter voted in February for a bill to finalize funding for what would have been an $825 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in southern Lincoln County.
That effort ultimately failed. In the wake of that failure, Rhoden established a Project Prison Reset task force to build consensus on the need, price and placement of a new facility to ease overcrowding at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
The group voted to back a 1,500-bed facility on undeveloped land in northeastern Sioux Falls, and to cap the price at $650 million.
Governor announces $17 million deal for Sioux Falls prison site, subject to legislative approval

The $175 million distance between the first figure and the second was also cited as a concern in the letter. 
Rhoden released a Frequently Asked Questions webpage last week on the prison that claims the prison’s designers were able to hit that budgetary mark, in spite of those designers telling the task force it was “a tall order” at the group’s final meeting in July.
Mortenson recalls being told in February that the state’s $825 million proposal was the lowest number possible for a 1,500-bed prison. On the House floor, Mortenson was among the lawmakers to repeat the DOC’s assertion that delay would inevitably increase the prison’s price.
“The same people in the administration were telling us they’d already found all the cost savings they could six months ago, and we believed them,” Mortenson said. “Now it’s a much different story.”
Rhoden: There are answers
The governor said Tuesday that there are “quantifiable answers” to the lawmakers’ questions. On the cost savings, he said the new design trims the number of buildings from seven to five, and consolidates common areas for inmates.
“We save 150,000 square feet right there,” Rhoden said.  
That figure is not on the prison FAQ page, however. On the price drop, the page says “contractors and designers are preparing a specific plan to meet this budget, and more detail will be added when it is available, in early September.”
Rhoden said he intends to hold conference calls with lawmakers in the coming days and weeks to answer their questions in advance of the special session.
“I would really like to see this evolve into a type of deal where it’s almost a formality to vote, that everybody is informed and comfortable enough that they can just go in, have their discussion and vote up or down,” he said.

Assistant House Minority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, said there’s a decent chance that lawmakers will be won over – if their questions are answered. Overweg still wants to know why Nebraska is building a prison for millions less than South Dakota, for example, and said the governor’s office has yet to satisfy his curiosity. 
The FAQ page says South Dakota’s prison “will be designed and built to last 100 years, with durable materials, modern security, and full programming spaces – unlike other states that cut corners upfront, only to face higher costs later.”
Overweg, echoing a refrain from lawmakers like Reps. Lems and Hansen, sees value in putting the project out for bids again to make sure. 
“I don’t think there’s any urgency,” he said. “I think the special session is crazy. There’s no reason we couldn’t do this first thing at the start of the next session” in January.
He also wants assurances that the price lawmakers vote on is the price that will stick. The new women’s prison in Rapid City, currently under construction, came in at a final price of $87 million. Initially, Overweg said, it was pitched at a cost a lot closer to $30 million.

Article Summary

Gov. JB Pritzker said he expects ICE’s work in Chicago to look similar to recent federal action in Los Angeles. ICE operations are expected to begin later this week.
In an Oval Office news conference just before Pritzker spoke, President Donald Trump said ‘we’re going in’ when asked about sending the National Guard to Chicago. Pritzker argued Trump is waiting for a skirmish between law enforcement and protesters to justify the deployment.
Also on Tuesday, a federal judge in California ruled Trump had no legal basis to deploy troops to L.A.
Pritzker said information gathered from sources indicates Mexican Independence Day celebrations could be ICE’s target.
Trump cited Chicago’s violent Labor Day weekend as evidence the city needs National Guard intervention.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday he expects Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to employ the same aggressive strategies they used in Los Angeles earlier this summer after President Donald Trump said he will deploy the National Guard to Chicago.
The information, Pritzker said, was not directly communicated to him, but rather gleaned from anonymous sources in the federal government, military and “well-sourced” news reports.  He said he’s been told members of the Texas National Guard are being readied for deployment to Chicago and many of the same federal ICE and Homeland Security groups that worked in L.A. are being relocated to Chicago.
Pritzker said Illinois State Police received a call from Customs and Border Protection Chief Gregory Bovino over the weekend confirming that ICE will ramp up immigration enforcement in Chicago at some point this week. But the call, Pritzker said, was more rhetorical than informational.
Bovino, who was recently described in a New York Times article as “the face” of Trump’s immigration policies, led immigration operations in L.A. which included aggressive and sometimes controversial tactics leading to claims of racial profiling, according to the Times.
“Any rational person who has spent even the most minimal amount of time studying human history has to ask themselves on one important question: Once they get the citizens of this nation comfortable with the current atrocities committed under the color of law, what comes next?” Pritzker said.
To what extent the effort will be aided by the National Guard is unclear. But just minutes before Pritzker took questions, Trump removed any doubt that he’d like to deploy the National Guard – even as a federal judge in California ruled Tuesday that his Guard deployment in that city was illegal.
“We’re going in. I didn’t say when we’re going in,” Trump said from the Oval Office, repeating that he wants Pritzker to call him and ask for help.
Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago will be the staging grounds for ICE, the Sun-Times reported. Pritzker said staging began at the base Monday.
The governor also said he believes the Trump administration planned to come to Chicago in September to target Mexican Independence Day celebrations.
“Let’s be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here,” he said.
Chicago has one of the largest Latino populations in the nation, and 74% of that group are of Mexican heritage, according to a study last year by the University of Illinois Chicago. The city’s Mexican Independence Day parade is schedule for Sept. 14.
Pritzker encouraged residents to learn their rights and film ICE’s work.
“Authoritarians thrive on your silence,” he said. “Be loud for America.”
Pritzker also warned protesters to remain peaceful and said Trump plans to use skirmishes with ICE to justify sending the National Guard.
“If someone flings a sandwich at an ICE agent, Trump will try and go on TV and declare an emergency in Chicago,” he said. “I’m imploring everyone, if and when that happens, do not take the bait.”

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he plans to take legal action if federal officials take unconstitutional actions, including in law enforcement duties.
“President Trump has been utilizing the notion that he and he alone can deal with crime in American cities, and his preferred tool in doing so is the American military,” Raoul said. “The problem with this approach is that it’s both bad strategy and illegal.”
L.A. deployment illegal, judge rules
A federal judge in California ruled Tuesday morning that Trump’s troop deployment to Los Angeles in June to fight crime violated an 1878 law prohibiting the military from carrying out domestic law enforcement. The judge wrote there is ample evidence to suggest Trump plans to continue violating the law, citing the president’s statements about Chicago.
Trump activated thousands of members of the National Guard without California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s permission to manage protests against aggressive immigration raids in the city. The judge ruled there was no evidence of rebellion or that local law enforcement was unable to manage the protests themselves.
The ruling provides Illinois with a legal precedent to lean on should Trump again try to deploy the National Guard in Chicago under the guise of managing protests and protecting ICE officials.
“I would love to do it now,” Trump said of Chicago. “We’re going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country.”
Raoul said no situations that would allow the president to deploy the National Guard in Chicago exists.
“The militia clauses of the United States Constitution give Congress sole authority to decide the circumstances that allow the president to federalize the National Guard,” Raoul said. “The 10th Amendment preserves states’ sovereignty to enforce state laws as they see fit.”
Labor Day weekend violence
Labor Day weekend was violent in Chicago. Fifty-eight people were shot and eight were killed in incidents across the city, which included three mass shootings.
The violence marked an uptick from last year’s Labor Day weekend when 22 people were shot and eight were killed.
Trump inflated where Chicago ranks on crime compared to other cities in his remarks Tuesday, comparing it to Afghanistan and again calling it a “hell hole.”
“The president’s absurd characterizations do not match what is happening on the ground here,” Pritzker said. “He has no idea what he’s talking about. There is no emergency that warrants deployment of troops.”
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson blamed Trump for the city’s gun violence problems because Trump’s administration has withheld federal funding for violence prevention from the city. He added he welcomes more partnerships with federal law enforcement agencies.
Violent crime is down in Chicago this year, however. Chicago Police Department data through Aug. 24 shows crime is down 13% overall compared to 2024, including murders down 32%. Crime remains up 40% from 2021, however.

The crops continue to develop, with 63% of corn acres across the state now dented and 19% of soybeans coloring, for the reporting period of Aug. 25 through Aug. 31. 
Corn condition was rated at 84% good to excellent, the same as last week, while soybean condition at 77% good to excellent declined slightly from the week prior.

The report, written by U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, reported that the oat harvest in Iowa was “virtually complete” and farmers were nearly complete with their third cutting of alfalfa hay, with just 13% remaining. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers will be busy this month bailing hay, chopping silage and “beginning to gear up for harvest.”
“Now is also a great time to plan for seeding cover crops and adding other conservation practices to fields after harvest,” Naig said in a statement. 
Naig also noted the cool, dry conditions across the state that led to a “gorgeous holiday weekend.” 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, the state average temperature for the reporting period was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, which was more than 6 degrees below normal temperatures for the period. 
Several areas reported temperatures as low as 40 degrees during the period. 
While some eastern areas of the state had a couple inches of rain, the state average for the week was less than two-tenths of an inch, while the normal is 0.88 inch. 
Despite the less-than-an-inch of rain the past several reporting periods, soil moisture conditions remain adequate to surplus. Across the state, topsoil moisture conditions were 78% adequate and 12% surplus. Subsoil moisture conditions were similar with 79% adequate and 13% surplus. 
Soil conditions were driest in the southwest and southeast regions of the state. In those regions, around 30% of topsoil moisture was short, according to the report. 
According to the seven-day precipitation forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the majority of the state is forecast to receive less than half an inch of rain this week.

Landers,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/harvard-along-with-every-organization-in-trumps-cross-hairs-needs-to-embrace-being-uncomfortable/,"
The Trump administration’s intrusive and illegal actions demand leaving the realm of comfort, taking risks, and enduring for as long as it takes and as uncomfortable as it becomes to preserve the principles of academic independence. 
The post Harvard — along with every organization in Trump’s cross hairs — needs to embrace being uncomfortable  appeared firs[...]","THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S attacks on Harvard University contort the government’s regulatory power to exert ideological control over higher education. Harvard is a prime target because of its prominence and its wealth. Even though continuing to fight entails immediate discomfort, Harvard must resist the urge to take refuge in any temporary and illusory settlement. 
Fundamentally, the government’s list of allegations against Harvard and other universities smacks of a recent law school graduate developing a checklist of hypothetical arguments. 
The administration has presented no evidence for most of its claims, and Harvard has taken corrective action on the few that have a modicum of merit. Any organization, however distinguished, can become better. But the idea that a preeminent institution of higher education is so corrupt that the federal government must execute a hostile takeover strains credulity.  
Nonetheless, Harvard is still negotiating in good faith with its arbitrary and capricious antagonists. Striking an agreement would be mistake.  
Whether the Trump administration will honor any such agreement is uncertain. Harvard’s own dealings with the administration indicate that officials generate an ever-escalating set of regulatory threats.  
The accusations of the moment seem to move to the next item on the law graduate’s checklist. Settlement when future claims could be made based on the administration’s vindictive and retaliatory whims does not serve Harvard’s goals: protecting academic freedom and remaining in control over the ability to select students, hire faculty, and teach and conduct research according to recognized standards and values. 
Standing up to this unlawful and extortionist effort to control private institutions is not a comfortable position for Harvard – or any university, law firm, media organization, or corporation also in the Trump administration’s sights. Surprisingly, many of the most privileged and wealthy organizations and people in the country seem unwilling to use their power and to make sacrifices necessary to reject authoritarian control.   
Harvard must embrace discomfort and follow the example of notable movements that overcame government wrongdoing. Official segregation at public universities like the University of Mississippi and University of Georgia ended because people like James Meredith and Charlayne Hunter-Gault pursued their education despite violent threats. The Washington Post and New York Times withstood the retaliatory threats of the Nixon administration to publish the Pentagon Papers, official documents exposing government lies about the conduct of the Vietnam War. Central European University in Budapest relocated to Vienna rather than capitulate to the coercive intrusions of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s regime. And every law firm that has challenged the Trump administration’s sanctions has won in court, refusing to acquiesce in the silencing of advocates for the rule of law.  
Harvard should follow these examples. In this worthy crusade, Harvard can rely on the faith of thousands of alumni, students, and faculty who urge the university to stand its ground. 
Obviously, Harvard cannot relocate to another country to escape government intrusion. To steel its resolve, Harvard leaders need only recall the eternal shame of every institution that failed to desegregate voluntarily.   
During the “Red Scare” of the Cold War era, universities imposed ideological and viewpoint orthodoxy on faculty members, capitulating to federal and state government threats, costing many scholars their careers, and depriving students of valuable diverse perspectives. Universities have been apologizing for this cowardice and failure to defend academic freedom ever since. They should not make the same mistake in responding to the Trump administration’s abuse of federal regulatory power to impose its preferred viewpoints on higher education institutions. 
The harsh impact of lost funding and regulatory constraints on jobs, scholarly pursuits, and student opportunities cannot be discounted. Unlike many institutions, however, Harvard is in a privileged position to mitigate these effects. Of what use is power and prestige earned over the centuries if not deployed in the current circumstances? 
Authoritarian overreach requires a resolute response. Wealthy universities and their donors are accustomed to being comfortable.  
In an 1857 speech, Frederick Douglass said, “The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.” The Trump administration’s intrusive and illegal actions demand leaving the realm of comfort, taking risks, and enduring for as long as it takes and as uncomfortable as it becomes to preserve the principles of academic independence.

An adult and a juvenile pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder charges Tuesday in connection with the Aug. 11 beating in Burlington and subsequent death of a South Burlington resident.
Scott Kastner, 42, was allegedly the victim of a “frenzied mob style assault” by a group of people around 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 11, according to Burlington police. 
The attack began in an alley off Church Street and spilled on to City Hall Park. The victim was “savagely punched and kicked” while he was on the ground, causing a severe brain bleed that prompted emergency intubation and surgery at the University of Vermont Medical Center, according to court documents.

Kastner died five days later from complications due to blunt force trauma to the head, and the medical examiner preliminarily ruled his death a homicide, according to police. 
Originally from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Kastner leaves behind four children, six siblings and his parents, according to his obituary.
Police arrested one of the suspects on Friday and another on Saturday. At least three other minors have also been charged in relation to the case, police said.
Isaiah Argro, 26, of Queens, New York, and a 16-year-old Colchester resident VTDigger is not naming, were ordered held without bail by Judge Timothy Doherty after arraignments Tuesday morning in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. The juvenile was charged as an adult. 
A second-degree murder conviction carries up to a life sentence, with a presumptive minimum term of 20 years, according to the charge sheet filed by the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office.
Argro, who also uses the last name Agro, allegedly punched Kastner in the head approximately 10 times, police wrote in court documents. He is being held at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans.
The teenage defendant allegedly hit Kastner in the head approximately six times and pointed a gun at him, according to court documents. 
The judge further ordered the defendants must not have contact with each other nor with a woman who was a witness, according to court documents. Argro has previous criminal charges in New York, police said.
Amid continued debates about safety downtown, the Burlington City Council last week passed a resolution that includes increasing police presence, among other measures, to help create a safer and more welcoming City Hall Park. It also passed  a companion ordinance for some less serious violations to be processed through a restorative justice system.

Dan McKee joins local legislators and educational leaders to kick off the 2025-26 Attendance Matters RI campaign at the State House Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. (Governor's Office photo)More Rhode Island kids attended school in the last school year, pulling the state’s chronic absenteeism rate down to 22.1% — a decrease of around 2.6 percentage points, according to new state data released Tuesday.
The rate of chronic absenteeism — defined as missing at least 18 days of school, or 10% of a school year — was 24.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. 
The 2024-2025 academic year dip comprises about 142,360 fewer absences compared to the 2023-2024 school year. 
“I know that these improved results are happening only because of the hard work of the students, families, educators and administrators like those here today,” Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said at a Tuesday morning State House press conference to publicize the latest slate of initiatives tied to the ongoing Attendance Matters RI campaign.
School absenteeism rose sharply during the pandemic nationwide. In Rhode Island, chronic absenteeism rates peaked at 34.1% during the 2021-2022 school year. Statewide rates have declined for three consecutive years but have largely remained above pre-COVID 19 benchmarks of under 20%.
The state-controlled Providence Public Schools District (PPSD) saw robust improvement: Chronic absenteeism went down nearly 7 percentage points, from 36.2% to 29.3% for the 2024-2025 school year.
Overall, the state’s biggest school district has improved 27.8 percentage points since the 2021-2022 school year, when PPSD’s chronic absenteeism rate peaked at 57.1%. 
Reversing chronic absenteeism trends has been a major concern of Infante-Green and Gov. Dan McKee, who emphasized Rhode Island’s recent progress while detailing the state’s continued strategies to reduce chronic absenteeism as students return to school statewide.
“We really want families and parents to know that if that child is feeling good, they need to be in school,” McKee said. “We’re going to talk about the evidence that says that if you’re in school, you’re going to do better. It’s common sense, right? If you’re in school, if you show up, you’re going to do better.”
New attendance guidance for the state’s public schools suggests flagging students who miss 10% of classes and are “significantly off-track” in their grades and studies. 
School districts should notify families of such students with a “Promotion in Doubt” letter by the end of the first quarter of the school year, and provide quarterly updates after the initial letter if necessary. Schools are advised to exhaust resources like Individualized Learning Plans, tutoring, transportation assistance and social services before deciding to hold a student back.
The commissioner noted that chronically absent students have a four-year high school graduation rate of just 58.9%, compared with 96.2% for their peers — a nearly 38-point gap, Infante-Green noted.
“Every student that we’re able to recover makes a difference in their lives and the lives of the state,” Infante-Green said, adding that some of the most effective interventions have been some of the simplest.
“Last year, we sent magnetic refrigerator calendars home with every single student in the state,” the commissioner said. “It was just a little thing that we tried, but students loved it. They were a physical representation of the hard work our students were doing by showing up to school every single day.”
Infante-Green said that families have been inquiring about the calendars’ return this year, and she added that the calendars will once again be available this year to “every single household in Rhode Island.” 
Also premiering this year is an attendance heat map which shows in real-time when absences spike at the school, district, and state level. Absenteeism rates tend to cluster around weekends and holiday breaks — an anecdotal argument the state now has data to back up, Infante-Green said.
Complete attendance and absenteeism data for the 2024-2025 school year is available on RIDE’s website.

The project began in a handful of towns and has grown to serve grade-schoolers and their families in a dozen communities across the White River Valley.

This story, by Maryellen Apelquist, was first published in the White River Valley Herald on August 28. 
In the 1990s, Frank Lamson, a newly credentialed pediatric nurse practitioner fresh off a stint at an urban school clinic in Massachusetts, came home to South Royalton with an idea: that such a clinic “would really be a good thing to have in a rural community.”
He shared that thought with friend and pediatrician Becky Foulk, who just a few years before had opened a private medical practice in town, and with whom Lamson worked. The doctor agreed, and it wasn’t long before the duo teamed with others, including local school nurses, to open HealthHUB, Vermont’s first school-based clinic.
Since then, 1995, the nonprofit clinic, funded with a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant channeled through the state Agency of Human Services, has operated in collaboration with the South Royalton Health Center to provide in-school medical care, mental health counseling, and a mobile dental program that expanded in 2009. What began as care for students in a handful of towns, South Royalton, Sharon, Tunbridge and Strafford, has grown to serve grade-schoolers and their families in a dozen communities across the White River Valley, from Brookfield to Stockbridge.
While all of HealthHUB’s services are in demand — the organization’s leaders report wait lists in some areas, including mental health care — the dental program is perhaps most widely recognized. Last school year, the dental clinic alone had about 400 patient visits.
Its signature silver-gray trailer with a large, smiling tooth on the side, outfitted as a dental office, can be spotted parked throughout the region, from the employee lot at Gifford Medical Center during the summer months to schools throughout the valley.
The hub’s first such trailer, purchased with a $95,000 grant awarded with the support of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently reached the end of its useful life as a clinic. It’s now parked in the lot of the town office in Royalton and used for storage.
Its successor, another silver gray unit, has been making the rounds, and Lamson eagerly reported that it is now joined by another vehicle in the HealthHUB fleet, a big rig named “Rosie.”
Tuesday, just one day before the start of school in the White River Valley, the nurse practitioner showed off 42-foot-long Rosie, a shiny motor home named for iconic Rosie the Riveter and built out with an interior to accommodate a comprehensive dental program.
Inside, HealthHUB, which has expanded in the last few years to also provide dental care to adults when school is not in session, provides a long list of services ranging from cleanings and exams to extractions, fillings, crowns, dentures and more.
Lamson himself flew to West Virginia to get Rosie, and drove the rig home to Vermont last fall. It cost $125,000 and came fully equipped with two dental chairs and all necessary office equipment, including a panoramic X-ray system.
“We had purchased that from the health department in Morgantown, [W.Va.],” Lamson said, explaining the branding wrapped around the vehicle that will be soon switched out to HealthHUB’s. “They got a big infrastructure grant from the feds to buy a brand-new one, but they had been using this as a mobile dental office for several years and wanted to sell it. And we were in the right position to acquire it.”
HealthHUB employs a fulltime dentist, dental hygienist, and dental assistant, and Foulk and Lamson are seeking another hygienist and others to join their health care team.
Hiring the full-time dentist, Colleen Anderson, two years ago, “was just a monumental step,” said Foulk.
“When she came onboard, we had been doing a little bit of work for adults with cleanings and stuff in after-school hours and during school vacations and over the summer, you know, that kind of thing. But we really expanded our dental services to offer full-service dentistry. And so we have quite a few adult patients now because there are a lot of adults who also receive benefits either under Medicaid or Medicare, or just are limited in their ability to travel places who utilize our services.”
Thirty years on, Lamson and Foulk’s vision—to provide access to health care services for children and their communities, where they are—remains as simple as it began.
“One of my mantras in establishing this thing has been to keep students in school and their parents at work,” Lamson said, “where kids at school could actually have medical care.”
For Foulk, the key to HealthHUB’s endurance has been its partnerships.
“That’s what this organization has been all about, building partnerships with other organizations to keep it going. So now we’re serving 12 different towns in eight locations,” Foulk said. “For instance, when we go to Randolph, we see kids from Brookfield and Braintree as well. They get bused in. It’s really grown.”
Community partners include Gifford Health Care, Chelsea Health Center, the town of Royalton and the region’s three school districts.
White River Valley nurse Susan Schuhmann, who’s worked at the school for 15 years, has long admired HealthHUB.
“It’s a great service for the community. The child doesn’t need to be pulled out of school early, missing schooltime to go to a doctor’s appointment. It can happen right here, then they’re back to class. And it does help parents who are working or who have transportation issues.”
While there is no celebration planned for HealthHUB’s 30th, Foulk said they could always use additional support, particularly with the uncertainty at the federal level concerning cuts to programs like Medicaid.
“We are trying to plan. It’s hard to know. And it’s hard to know how much the state of Vermont is going to step up and fill in the gaps, how much the state of Vermont will even be able to do that. So it’s hard to plan, but we’re trying to.”
Foulk noted efforts to increase fundraising in the communities served by HealthHUB, including by going, starting in 2026, to each of the annual town meetings “and making requests from every town that we serve, which we haven’t done in the past.”
HealthHUB accepts Vermont Medicaid and is an in-network Northeast Delta Dental provider. Foulk also noted that the team doesn’t “turn anyone away.”
“If somebody can’t pay, they don’t pay. And if they can just pay a little bit, there’s a sliding scale.”
Appointments with HealthHUB Dental Services may be made by calling 802-888-3384.

Stuart Hurd — a career civil servant who worked as the Bennington town manager since 1992 and a total of 52 years for the municipality — died Saturday at age 77 from a long-term illness, the Bennington Banner reported. 
Sharyn Brush, who previously served on the selectboard, zoning board and as a town health officer, said Hurd served in many roles in town government and on local boards. She said “his door was always open” to talk to Bennington community members. 
“He wore many hats, and he wore them all well,” Brush said. “He solved problems well. He looked after the town. He was conscious of the budgets, and he really, really loved Bennington.”
State Rep. Mary Morrissey, R-Bennington, said Hurd “went right up the ranks,” serving the town for around 20 years before taking on the role of town manager in the early ’90s. 
“Stuart was highly respected around the state by fellow town managers and heads of communities as well,” Morrissey said. “That says volumes as to who the man was.”
Assistant Town Manager Dan Monks assumed the town manager’s duties when Hurd took extended medical leave on July 8, according to the Bennington Banner.
Town officials declined to comment on Hurd’s life and legacy Tuesday in accordance with family wishes.

Michelle Lujan Grisham; Joe Altepeter, a DARPA program manager and quantum researcher; Economic Development Secretary Rob Black; and New Mexico Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque) announced further investments in advanced quantum computing. Lujan Grisham told Source NM the sling was due to a recent rotator cuff surgery. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico leaders said a federal partnership announced Tuesday will help launch the state as the “next Silicon Valley” in the frontier of quantum computing, a nascent technology that boosters say will revolutionize problem solving from cancer research to code-breaking.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a $120 million dollar partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the research and development wing of the U.S. military — will ensure companies can deliver on their proofs of concept for advanced computing. The state and DARPA may contribute up to $60 million dollars each over four years to vet projects promising advanced computers. If companies can prove their prototypes work at a utility-scale, DARPA will award up to $300 million in development.
The partnership, called the Quantum Frontier Initiative, will push development, testing and validate emerging technologies, she said.
Lujan Grisham said she wanted New Mexico to be known as the “home of quantum computing,” during an announcement Tuesday in Roadrunner Venture studio, as Albuquerque hosts 1,500 researchers for a national Quantum Week conference.
After the announcement, Lujan Grisham told Source NM the state was looking to build the ecosystem for quantum to thrive, noting that DARPA’s certification program would attract companies from across the U.S.
“When companies come here to do a proof of concept, then my job is to keep them here,” Lujan Grisham said. “It creates a migration of companies, and that’s what Silicon Valley did.”
The promise of quantum computing would mean the power to perform calculations beyond a traditional computer’s abilities. Even with recent developments in quantum computers, they remain expensive to build, error-prone and fragile to interference, since information is encoded into supercold atoms or in extremely small circuits. If realized, quantum computing poses risks to the encryption that governments and companies use to protect sensitive information.
The State of New Mexico has made a series of investments totaling tens of millions of dollars in quantum computing in recent years.
In April, Lujan Grisham signed a bill to set up the Technology Innovation Division inside the state’s Economic Development Department with $40 million to seek private or federal investments in emerging technologies. New Mexico is also a finalist for $160 million over 10 years from the National Science Foundation to develop quantum technologies for both civilian and military uses. Last week, the state gave Roadrunner Ventures a $25 million grant to develop a downtown hub to build an “Innovation District” focused on quantum computing.
Officials said the state gets a boost from the development of projects at the state’s two national laboratories in Los Alamos and Albuquerque and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base.
“We bring the capacity of our national laboratories adding to those workforces, adding to that with our universities, tying that in with [Central New Mexico Community College] creating a quantum boot camp,” Economic Development Secretary Rob Black said. “We are building the workforce.”
DARPA, which has invested in research and development projects for everything from synthetic blood to manta ray-shaped submarines, will provide $60 million to researchers to stress-test quantum computer proposals, said Joe Altepeter, a program manager for Quantum Benchmarking Initiative .
Altepeter got his start in quantum research at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a graduate student in 1999. He described himself previously as a “skeptic,” but said recent developments in the technology raise the question if it’s possible to develop a working quantum computer by 2033. He said the certification program aims to separate working proposals from hype.
“It is an extraordinarily difficult job to figure out to forecast, maybe 10 years in the future, whose phenomenal plan, which is great on paper, is really gonna work…really deliver or transformative change and which ones aren’t,” Altpeter said.
The validation process is a series of three phases to try and determine if quantum companies can develop a computer valuable enough to be worth the cost. DARPA will not necessarily keep an office in the state, but researchers and contractors evaluating the projects will frequently visit Albuquerque or live in-state.
Developing quantum will benefit the whole state, “not just Albuquerque or just scientists,” by increasing the tax base and diversifying the state’s economy, Nora Meyers Sackett, the director at the NM Technology and Innovation Office, told Source NM.
“Quantum is the next revolution of technology, and we’re working to make that revolution happen right here in New Mexico,” she said.

A group of leaders across state government are facing the logistical complexities of planning for employees to work in person three days per week starting in December.

In just three months, state employees will be required to work in person three days a week, a major shift for many in the state’s 8,000-plus workforce.
This week, a team of top officials across Vermont agencies have started to think through the logistics of that transition.
The state’s plan has materialized quickly. In early August, Gov. Phil Scott first mentioned his intention to bring employees back to their offices on a more regular basis. Last week, Administration Secretary Sarah Clark announced the broad sketches of that proposal in a message to all state employees. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, has strongly opposed the plan. State data indicates that remote flexibility is hugely popular. In a 2024 survey, more than 80% of employees who worked at least partially remotely said it benefited their individual performance, and more than 90% said the arrangement positively benefited their work-life balance.

Amid the looming challenges of the return to office, Douglas Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer and head of a new group of state leaders providing recommendations on the transition, highlighted the goal of the policy shift — a benefit the state risks losing otherwise. 
“When I came to work at the state 14 years ago, I had people that were sitting two, three desks down that had 30 years of experience,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “I could just easily pop questions to them, or if they noticed I was doing something silly, they would let me know. And that isn’t possible in the remote environment.”
While some departments in state government have long required an in-person work approach, thousands of workers have grown accustomed to some amount of telework since the Covid-19 pandemic upended how almost every industry operates. 
Not everyone working for the state will be impacted. Vermont’s constitutional offices, with independently elected leaders, set their own workplace plans. A spokesperson for Attorney General Charity Clark said the office intends to stick with a two-day-per-week in-office schedule that began in 2024. The Treasurer’s Office would also continue a hybrid approach that runs the gamut from completely in-person to fully remote depending on the job, according to a spokesperson for Treasurer Mike Pieciak. 
The cross-agency advisory group Farnham is leading has just begun its work, meaning they have more questions than answers, but they have started by addressing the highest-priority topics raised in both official and unofficial staff feedback. 
“The farther away from the office you live, the more anxiety that causes,” Farnahm said. 
The state’s bargaining agreement with employees requires two weeks’ notice for a cancellation of a telework agreement, and the governor’s plan is providing 90 days, he said. 
It’s likely the state will develop a plan using its existing office footprint, according to state leaders. 
“They fit in the space pre-Covid,” Wanda Minoli, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services, said. “I don’t see any reason why we would need to be leasing more space.”
Little space remains uninhabitable from the previous summers’ flooding, according to Minoli, though workers have not returned to some Montpelier properties.
In 2023, the state announced its plan to sell its 108 Cherry St. office in Burlington, where more than 400 employees were assigned. A real estate listing for the state property refers to the building as under contract, and a purchase and sale agreement has been signed, but the details aren’t yet public, according to Minoli. The property’s assessed value is more than $29 million.  
Space constraints will be addressed by scheduling, according to Minoli. Employees may not all be in the office on the same day. 
“It’s a recommendation that you could have your own workstation, but that doesn’t mean you need to have it,” she said. 
While the state may have the space for its employees, the home addresses of some of those employees have changed. Though a relatively small group, a growing number of out-of-state employees have joined Vermont’s state government, according to Farnham, another logistical complexity for state leaders to address.

(Juan Salinas II/ Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After a Republican colleague nixed the idea for a public hearing of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, the lone Democrat who chairs a Nebraska legislative committee has scheduled a hearing for the public to air concerns and get answers about Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to convert the McCook Work Ethic Camp into a jail for migrants the federal government wants to deport.
The Sept. 12 hearing called by State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, chair of the Legislature’s Urban Affairs Committee, comes on the heels of the Judiciary chair’s decision not to host a hearing.

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln last week called it “premature” to hold a hearing sought by 13 progressive lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, including McKinney. Many have been critical of the Pillen administration plan, which responds to an amped up Immigration and Customs Enforcement strategy and campaign pledge by President Donald Trump to use states to help accelerate mass deportations.
Last week, Bosn suggested instead that the group direct questions to Pillen and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. She said that would be faster and more effective and said the Judiciary Committee had “no more extraordinary authority” than a single or group of lawmakers seeking answers.
 McKinney letter 

Tuesday, McKinney issued a letter of his own saying that due to “potential building code issues” presented by Pillen’s plan, the Urban Affairs committee under Legislative Resolution 148 will offer “a space to discuss such concerns.” The 9 a.m. hearing on Friday, Sept. 12., is open to the public in room 1507 of the Capitol.
McKinney told the Nebraska Examiner he has invited Pillen’s team to the hearing, and expects administration responses will promote “transparency” to Nebraskans. He said he had been considering a hearing before the Urban Affairs Committee before the Judiciary Committee chair opted out.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
McKinney’s letter, which he and others publicized on social media and sent to state agencies, the all-male Work Ethic Camp in McCook has 200 beds and an operational capacity of 125. 
A repurposed facility for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement would house about 300 people — an increase in capacity that McKinney’s letter described as “concerning, foremost for safety and security.” It would be state-owned and operated and, state officials have said, the federal government would fully reimburse Nebraska to house federal migrant detainees there. 
McKinney’s letter says Nebraska law requires state buildings and jails to conform with International Building Code standards, including calculations for maximum occupancy. The Urban Affairs Committee oversees legislation and issues related to state building codes.
The letter said that according to state law, “A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist whenever the director certifies that the department’s population is over 140% of operations capacity.” 
McKinney asserts that the 300-bed facility planned by Pillen and ICE would put the facility at 240% of a 125-person operational capacity.
The Pillen administration has indicated that accommodating up to 300 detainees would mean repurposing existing spaces previously used for meetings and other programming. The 186 people Nebraska housed at the McCook facility as of Aug. 19 are to be moved to other prisons over the next two months, with specifics still being ironed out.

 Prison overcrowding

Legislatively approved in April 1997, the McCook Work Ethic Camp opened in April 2001 as an effort to reduce prison crowding, primarily by offering rehabilitative programming to low-risk offenders. As a result, the facility hoped to open up space for more violent offenders in other state facilities.
The Work Ethic Camp has most recently served adult men convicted of felonies who need substance use treatment or cognitive restructuring. It had an annual state budget of $9.5 million last year and about 85 staff.
Tuesday, Omaha retiree Paul Feilmann stood with a huge sign outside the Governor’s Residence to protest the detention facility. “I’m trying to keep the issue out there,” the former delivery van driver said, and plans to return every week day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for three weeks. His record stay on such vigils, he noted, is four months in 2019 objecting to lack of criminal justice reform.
Mostly alone Tuesday, Feilmann talks to passersby about the issue and makes calls to strategize with others that have the same goal: to get Pillen to change direction.
“It’s dehumanizing and historically raises a whole bunch of nasty inhuman issues,” he said, calling the ICE facility a “bridge too far.”
In the earlier Aug. 27 letter to Bosn — on the letterhead of State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha — the 13 senators posed multiple questions. They noted that the Judiciary Committee chaired by that Bosn has jurisdiction over matters relating to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services.

Hunt’s letter said Pillen did not seek input from the Legislature on the repurposed detention facility the Trump administration nicknamed the “Cornhusker Clink.” Hunt called that problematic, as the Legislature is “the people’s branch … a co-equal and independent branch of government.”
 Legality issues 

Among questions the lawmakers had was about the legality of Pillen entering a federal agreement to convert a state-run, legislatively defined prison into a federal immigration detention facility, and the legality of Correctional Services facilities and staff being used to house ICE detainees.
The Nebraska Constitution’s Article IV, Section 19, has since 1875 given the Legislature exclusive authority in the “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”
The Legislature this spring completed a nearly two-year effort to clarify and strengthen its legislative oversight of executive branch agencies, including the state prison system.

Commenting previously on the Hunt letter, Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokesperson, said lawmakers had not posed their questions to the Governor’s Office. She said lawmakers who want answers are welcome to ask.
“The governor has always been transparent and would be more than happy to answer questions,” Strimple said. “However, the administration cannot answer questions when they are not asked. Rather than engaging in political theater, these Democrat senators should simply send these questions to be answered.”

He has since been elected to the position three times. 
Nevada’s 12-year limit on the terms of most elected officials do not apply to county administrative offices such as clerk, sheriff, and district attorney. 
“These are tough times, and now more than ever, experience matters,” Wolfson said in a video announcing his reelection campaign. 
Wolfson raised $1.6 million in 2022 for his last reelection bid and had $475,000 on hand after handily defeating Republican Timothy Treffinger.
A registered Democrat, Wolfson contributed $2,500 of his campaign windfall to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo; $1,000 to Republican Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama; and $1,000 and $1,500 respectively to Republican state Senate candidates Lori Rogich and John Steinbeck, whose elections were integral to Lombardo’s successful effort to block a veto-proof Democratic majority in the Senate. 
Wolfson made smaller contributions to Democratic legislative candidates Cameron Miller, Marlene Drake, and Ryan Hampton.   
He also contributed $10,000 to his daughter Rebecca’s campaign for Las Vegas Municipal Judge.  
Wolfson’s campaign news release touts his creation in 2016 of the Conviction Integrity Unit to review questionable cases. The next year, he signed off on the exoneration of DeMarlo Berry, who served 22 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. 
At the time, Wolfson said he created the unit “to provide a way for certain cases to be reviewed independently and evaluated on a variety of factors, including new evidence.”   
But new evidence failed to win over Wolfson in the case of Fred Steese, who Wolfson forced to plead guilty to second degree murder to avoid a lawsuit against the state, according to defense attorney Lisa Rasmussen. 
When Judge Elissa Cadish wrote an order finding Steese innocent after evidence revealed he was in Idaho on the day of the murder for which he was convicted, Wolfson threatened to keep Steese in custody for years pending the D.A.’s appeal of Cadish’s order.
“Wolfson said if Steese wanted to get out he had to take an Alford plea and admit to second degree murder,”  Rasmussen says. After 22 years in prison, Steese opted for the Alford plea, a twisted legal maneuver requiring defendants to plead guilty to crimes they didn’t commit.
The move prevented Steese from suing the state for wrongful prosecution and a potential judgment in his favor.  
Wolfson’s campaign also touts his establishment of Clark County’s “first pre-charge diversion program.” The campaign did not immediately respond to requests for explanation. 
In his 2022 campaign Wolfson touted a post-conviction program to give offenders “the help they need, rather than being sent to prison.” 
Wolfson’s office had no data on the number of participants or their success rate, and a court administrator told the Current that judges were unaware of the program.  
“We do not have any records of the program or information about that program in our database,” wrote Hans Jessup of the state’s Administrative Office of the Court.
In 2018, Wolfson campaigned for a victim rights ballot measure known as Marsy’s Law, which was financed almost entirely by billionaire Henry Nicholas, who at the time faced felony counts of drug trafficking in Clark County.  
The following year, the Current reported that two of the three non-profits sharing a $1 million dollar donation that helped keep Nicholas and his friend, Ashley Fargo out of prison, had ties to the Clark County District Attorney’s office and Nicholas’ defense attorney David Chesnoff.   
Last year, following the arrest of two suspects in the abandonment of Reba, a bulldog who died days after being discarded in a plastic bin, Wolfson bemoaned animal abuse and neglect laws that he said prevented him from seeking stiff sentences. An investigation by the Current revealed Wolfson rarely sought prison time for such offenses.

(Department of Defense Inspector General)Alabama elected officials praised President Donald Trump’s announcement Tuesday that a key military command – which has been operational in Colorado for nearly two years – would be starting over from scratch in Huntsville.
Speaking from the Oval Office and flanked by members of the state’s congressional delegation, the president said U.S. Space Command headquarters would be relocated to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville from its current home in Colorado Springs, Colo.
“This will result in more than 30,000 Alabama jobs – and probably much more than that – and hundreds of billions of dollars in investment,” Trump said. “Most importantly, this decision will help America defend and dominate the ‘high frontier,’ as they call it.”

Other estimates, including figures presented at the same Oval Office announcement by Alabama’s congressional delegation, put the number of jobs at about a tenth of Trump’s claim: 1,600 direct and 3,000 induced positions.
“This move will save the taxpayers $480 million,” said U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, citing a figure the Air Force put forward in its initial selection of Redstone Arsenal as the preferred headquarters location. “We look forward to building a huge Space Command and having the Donald J. Trump Space Command Center in Huntsville.”
Established in 2019, U.S. Space Command is responsible for planning and executing global space operations for the U.S. military and other Defense agencies. Those operations include satellite communications, offensive and defensive space control capabilities, and defense of the national security space architecture.
“The Redstone Arsenal region was ready to welcome Space Command Headquarters when I made the official pitch to the Defense secretary in June 2019, and it remains ready today to not only welcome Headquarters, but to welcome all of the military personnel and their families,” Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement.

Political fallout

Trump’s announcement is the latest move in a six-year-long tug-of-war between Alabama and Colorado over the permanent home for the military’s newest combat command. Along the way, presidents and elected officials of both parties have asserted they were motivated only by national security while accusing their opponents of playing partisan politics.
“What we’ve seen through this process is the worst of Washington – we’ve seen politics get in the way of what is best for the warfighter, what’s best for national security,” U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama,  said Tuesday. “The state of Alabama is about to show the country the best.”
Yet Trump himself noted that reasons beyond national security and preparedness motivated his decision.
Trump to move Space Command headquarters out of Colorado

“The problem I have with Colorado – one of the big problems – they do mail-in voting … so they automatically have crooked elections,” he said. “That played a big factor.”
Tuesday’s announcement follows multiple reviews – by the Government Accountability Office and the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General, as well as the U.S. Air Force itself – of the selection process that led to the choice of Redstone Arsenal for a permanent headquarters for Space Command.
Alabama’s elected officials have consistently pointed to aspects of the initial selection process and the subsequent reviews that favored Huntsville.
“Alabama was chosen in 2021 because it was the absolute best location for the Space Command headquarters,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. “Today, in 2025, it remains the best location for our national security and for the taxpayer.”
Yet parts of the GAO and OIG reports have called into question some of the points in Alabama’s favor. In addition, Space Command has been operational in Colorado Springs since December 2023, which Colorado’s politicians have stressed in calling for the headquarters to remain there.
Even before Trump’s announcement, Colorado vowed a court challenge against any move to relocate the command.
“Moving Space Command Headquarters to Alabama is not only wrong for our national defense, but it’s harmful to hundreds of Space Command personnel and their families,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement released Tuesday morning. “The Colorado Attorney General’s Office has been preparing in the event the president made such an unlawful decision to move Space Command HQ. If the Trump administration takes this step – I’m prepared to challenge it in court.”
A statement signed by Colorado’s entire congressional delegation – Republicans and Democrats – alleges the move would weaken national security, not strengthen it.
“Moving Space Command sets our space defense apparatus back years, wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, and hands the advantage to the converging threats of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,” the statement reads. “The Department of Defense Inspector General’s office has reported multiple times that moving the Command will impede our military’s operational capability for years.”
Decisions and reviews
In May 2019, the U.S. Air Force identified six locations as potential permanent locations for Space Command headquarters, including what was then called Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville. In January 2021, the Air Force announced it had chosen Redstone Arsenal as its preferred location, pending an environmental assessment. That was completed by September 2022, but the Air Force secretary at the time, Frank Kendall, never announced a final decision.
Meanwhile, reviews by two federal watchdog agencies had largely validated that initial selection process.
In May 2022, the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General concluded that applicable laws and Department of Defense policies were followed, though some supporting documentation was improperly discarded. The following month, the Government Accountability Office reported that while the Air Force largely followed its established basing guidelines, those guidelines did not include independent reviews or well-documented cost analyses, leading to at least the potential for bias.
Then in July 2023, the Pentagon announced that the headquarters would remain at its initial Colorado location – the recently renamed Peterson Space Force Base – per a decision by then-President Joe Biden.
That touched off a firestorm in Alabama’s congressional delegation.
U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Madison, whose 5th Congressional District includes Huntsville and Redstone Arsenal, accused the Biden administration of “ignoring what is best for our nation’s security” in favor of “their woke agenda.” Tuberville said the decision “inserted politics into what had been a fair and objective competition,” while Britt said Biden “irresponsibly” contradicted the Air Force’s preference “in the name of partisan politics.”
In response, Rogers, using his authority as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, inserted a hold on construction of the Colorado headquarters into the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, pending additional reviews – again by GAO and the Defense Department’s Inspector General.
Those were made public earlier this year. While each partly reiterated their previous findings, events on the ground in Colorado – including Space Command achieving “full operational capability” nearly two years ahead of schedule – had altered the picture.
Released in April, the Pentagon IG’s report noted that officials with both Redstone Arsenal and Space Command said it would take up to four years for a Huntsville headquarters to achieve comparable levels of readiness to what was in place in Colorado Springs. Moreover, the command expressed concern that “most of the 1,000 civilians, contractors and reservists will not relocate” if a move to Alabama were ordered.
In May, the GAO’s second review called into question the Air Force’s claim that siting the headquarters at Redstone Arsenal would result in cost savings of $480 million – the figure that Tuberville cited Tuesday in the Oval Office.
Auditors, however, noted the cost estimates presented by the service were incomplete and were based on analysis by a consulting firm whose methodology was undocumented.
“Further, the Air Force assigned a confidence level of 5 percent to the cost estimates, a number that represents a low level of confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the estimate,” the GAO report stated.

Golden future

The tussle over Space Command has taken on new relevance as Trump has emphasized space and missile defense under his Golden Dome initiative.
Trump on Tuesday said locating Space Command in Huntsville would build on north Alabama’s existing strengths in space and missile defense, with the headquarters playing “a key role” in building out Golden Dome
“We will be having a Golden Dome the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before, the finest and best,” he said.
Experts gathered in Huntsville last month for the annual space and missile defense expo stressed that Golden Dome will likely be a layered blend of systems designed to counter different threats – with data and command and control being key problems to solve.
Alabama is already home to a vast and growing defense base that touches aspects of all U.S. missile defense systems. Industry is still awaiting specifics on what will be prioritized – and funded – under Golden Dome procurement.
Strong said Tuesday that politics aside, basing Space Command in Huntsville is the right choice for national security.
“North Alabama has long been the linchpin of defending our interests at home and abroad, and we are prepared to now do our part in defending American interests in space,” Strong said Tuesday. “We have the right people in the right place at the right time.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Space-Command-for-April-15-2025-story-1024x684.png,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

Tom Millett, R-Marion, right, speaks to a Montanan after a legislative hearing during the 2025 session. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Flathead Valley lawmaker is on the hook for more than $427,000 in unpaid federal taxes — an amount he has disputed — after the U.S. Ninth Circuit Appeals Court declined to take up his appeal from a federal district court. 
Rep. Thomas Millett, R-Marion, did not file federal income taxes from 2004-2009, or 2011-2012, according to court documents, and he filed, but did not pay, federal taxes in 2010 and 2013-2017, except what was withheld by his employer. 
In a ruling handed down by Montana Federal District Court Judge Donald Molloy in 2023, five years of tax liens were found to be legally attached to a property in Marion that Millett previously co-owned; and his disputed tax burden was reduced to a judgement of more than $400,000. 
During initial proceedings before the District Court, Millett stated he was exempt from paying federal taxes because he believed only individuals who work in Washington, D.C., “earn taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.”
Acting as his own lawyer, he also argued that the government had failed to follow its own collection laws and the IRS had failed to properly notify him of deficiencies for eight of the tax years. But his arguments did not sway the judge, who ruled against him multiple times throughout the case. 
Millett appealed Molloy’s decision up to the Ninth Circuit, but a panel of judges unanimously declined to take up the appeal and affirmed the district court decision, stating Millett offered no evidence contrary to the ruling. 
“The district court’s conclusions were supported by Millett’s tax returns and IRS assessments. For the tax years in which Millett did not file a return, the court’s conclusions were supported by Millett’s own testimony, IRS assessments, copies of notices of deficiency, and certified mailing logs,” the circuit judges wrote. 
Millett told the Daily Montanan in an email that he is still “weighing whether or not to appeal” the circuit decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but “regardless, I will abide by the final decision of the courts.”
“I believe everyone should pay their taxes according to the law. For several years I’ve been in a dispute with the government over how much I owe from several years ago (pre-2018),” Millett wrote. “I believe I owe ‘X’ amount. The government says I owe ‘Y’ amount. I believe the government hasn’t followed the collection laws. They say they have followed the collection laws.”
Millett added that he is current on his taxes after 2018. 
“People may ask, ‘Why take on the federal government?’ The answer is because I believe in exercising my 5th Amendment protected right to due process and for holding everyone, even the federal government, accountable to following the law,” Millett wrote. “This is the same position I have taken when it comes to dealing with government at any level including as the Representative of House District 2.”
Millett served his first term in the Legislature during 2025, representing House District 2, which spans U.S. Highway 2 from Libby to just west of Kalispell. 
During his first term, Millett sponsored 14 bills, four of which were signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte. 
The bills that passed included allowing political parties to contribute to judicial candidates; increasing fines for aquatic invasive species violations; and anti-SLAPP legislation protecting citizens and journalists from frivolous lawsuits. 
He also sponsored failed bills to censor municipal judges; support Utah in a lawsuit seeking to transfer federal public lands to the state; promote the use of gold and silver as legal tender; and repeal the 17th Amendment, which provides for direct election of U.S. Senators.  
Millett told the Daily Montanan he intends to run for re-election in 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3179-scaled-e1756841528638-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

(Photo courtesy of Bur Oak Land Trust) Since July, grantees of AmeriCorps program funding, including one group in Iowa, have been waiting for their awarded funding for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. 
State attorneys general from 24 states and affected grantees alleged in separate lawsuits that the White House Office of Management and Budget was withholding the funds after preliminary injunctions ordered the program funds be restored.
 OMB released the funds as a filing deadline in the suit waged by the state attorneys general approached, and AmeriCorps grantees announced Tuesday they had also received their withheld funding.  
The release of nearly $185 million from OMB represents “the remaining Fiscal Year 2025 funding” for the programs, according to a filing in the case by OMB and other defendants.
The original suits against the administration stemmed from Department of Government Efficiency cuts to AmeriCorps program funding and staffing that have caused program closures across the country.
Both the attorneys general and grantees amended their original cases in August and alleged OMB was withholding funds it was ordered to release, including one bound for Bur Oak Land Trust, a group that works to preserve natural landscapes in Iowa. 
In addition to programming for nonprofits like Bur Oak Land Trust, AmeriCorps funding goes to place members in schools, local governments and nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.
Jason Taylor, Bur Oak Land Trust’s executive director said his group was “thrilled” that the funding was released. 
“We’re also really proud to be a part of this lawsuit and to have a number of states’ attorneys general be willing to step up and fight back against what the administration was doing,” Taylor said. 
Taylor said now that the $250,000 the trust was awarded for the 2025-2026 year is realized, a group of AmeriCorps members will be able to start working with the trust this week. Taylor said the funding for the year can support up to 12 AmeriCorps members. 
According to a filing in the case brought by the attorneys general, due to the release of the funds, the parties requested a stay in the preliminary injunction to facilitate their “conferring about the appropriate next steps” in the lawsuit. 
The government agencies, including OMB, in the expanded lawsuit by AmeriCorps grantees, filed for a deadline extension the same day OMB said it would release the funds. The extension was granted Tuesday.
A press release from Democracy Forward, the group that led the lawsuit along with Democracy Defenders Fund, and Lowell & Associates, said the grantees in the case received their promised funding. 
“AmeriCorps has a proven track record of supporting and improving communities across our nation, and is a beacon for the good that the people of our country can do when working together,” Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in the release. “We are honored to work with our partners and brave plaintiffs to defend against the Trump-Vance administration’s efforts to gut America’s premier national service agency.” 
Kelly Daly, the president of the AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027 – also a plaintiff in the suit against OMB – said union members look forward to “continuing our collective mission to strengthen America’s communities and ensure no working family gets left behind.”
Other plaintiffs named in the case with grantees includes: Aspire Afterschool, Democracy Maine, Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center, Elev8 Baltimore, HandsOn Suburban Chicago, Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, Michigan College Access Network, National College Attainment Network, North Carolina Housing Coalition, Partners for Campus-Community Engagement, Rainbow Labs, Red Cloud Indian School, Seed Coalition, The Corps Network and The Service Collaborative of WNY.
The 24 states whose attorneys general filed against the administration include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Jim Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood discuss state investments in public education. July 26, 2023. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A report from Nebraska’s Department of Revenue projects that the federal budget reconciliation bill will cost state government more than $216 million over the next two years. 
The department released the analysis as part of a state law that requires it to report to the Nebraska Legislature within 60 days of a change to the national Internal Revenue Code. Congress’ ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ that passed on July 4 was the subject of Tuesday’s report. 
DOR’s analysis spanned the next four fiscal years ending in 2029. It surmised that the expected losses in corporate and individual income tax revenue will cost Nebraska more than $406 million over those four years. Within the two years that make up the existing biennial budget, the losses would equal roughly $216 million. 
This will likely dent the state budget, but the projected impact won’t be clear until Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board next meets in October. Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said the board will consider this report, along with several other factors, including the state’s monthly tax receipts, when making state revenue projections.

At the board’s last meeting in July, members confirmed suspicions that Nebraska was back in a projected budget deficit to the tune of about $95 million. That, combined with Gov. Jim Pillen’s stated intent to cut Nebraska’s budget by up to 10%, will make finding revenue to support other measures like tax relief more difficult, according to Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. 
Though the revenue losses were about double what he was expecting, Clements said even if the department’s predictions are accurate the budget will still be “manageable.” He noted that the last two months of tax receipts have been higher than the board’s projections and argued that Pillen’s budget goals could help find savings to offset the new losses. 
“There’s no need to panic at this time,” Clements said.

The department’s report details the fiscal impacts of some specific measures within the federal reconciliation bill. The largest impacts to Nebraska come in corporate income tax revenues, where the bill expands several existing tax deductions and credits for businesses. 
Within the current budget cycle, these changes could cost Nebraska over $140 million in lost tax revenue, according to the report. 
Individual income tax losses make up a smaller but still sizable part of the impact, totaling more than $75 million over the budget’s two-year cycle. The bill similarly adds and expands several tax relief measures for individuals, including increasing the federal child tax credit, for example. 
The report does not touch on the changes to Medicaid, as that does not have a direct impact on tax revenue, DOR spokesman Patrick Roy said. Patent said the budgetary adjustments made in response to these changes likely wouldn’t happen until the state’s next two-year budget.
Despite the coming challenges, Clements said property tax relief still remains a top priority for himself and the governor. Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the report proves that the federal bill is already providing tax relief to Nebraskans.

Last week, Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a petition for the state’s highest court to consider removing Martin from her position, citing violations of the law and a hostile work environment including “yelling, screaming, and belittling behavior.” Martin has denied all allegations of hostile work environments. On Sept. 2, following the initial publication of this story, the state Supreme Court directed Martin to submit a response to Torrez’s petition.
A voicemail, text message and email to Martin were not returned before publication. 
The petition was sparked after state lawmakers voted to remove funding from Martin’s office and gave it to the neighboring district attorney in San Juan County, a move spearheaded by  Senate Finance Chair George Muñoz (D-Gallup), citing turnover of Gallup prosecutors. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the budget, but Martin has refused to cede financial control and filed a lawsuit in Santa Fe court against lawmakers, the governor and San Juan District Attorney Jack Fortner in July, which remains ongoing.
Torrez said in a news release Friday the failure to prosecute cases with defendents accused of murder and rape endangers the community and trust in the office, and will be added to the petition for Martin’s removal.
“The decision to dismiss these cases without properly referring them to another prosecutor jeopardized not only the pursuit of justice for the victims and their families, but also the safety of our communities. By stepping  in immediately, we are making sure these cases move forward and sending a clear message: no victim in New Mexico will be abandoned, and no community will be left unprotected,” Torrez said in a statement.
Further, the New Mexico Department of Justice requested the state’s highest court require the McKinley County District Attorney’s office to provide all information regarding case dismissals and refusals since Jan. 1 2021, saying it’s necessary to determine “how pervasive this problem is.” 
Both cases are several years old, which pushes the clock for statutes of limitations in bringing charges or finding evidence, the news release said. 
The first case was dismissed in 2023, against Tyson Long, now 28, who Gallup Police accused of murdering an unidentified man on Dec. 6, 2022. In court documents, police say they saw Long confronting the victim with a gun before shots were fired and fleeing the area. 
The petition to dismiss Long’s case noted that then-Chief Deputy District Attorney Mandana Shoushtari had stated there was a conflict of interest. 
When reached by phone on Friday, Shoushtari told Source NM she was ordered by Martin to dismiss the case and send it to another district attorney’s office for prosecution. 
“All the witnesses in the case were defendants I was prosecuting in other cases at the time, so by law, I couldn’t put them on the stand and cross-examine them,” she told Source NM.
Shoushtari said she was unclear on the timeline, but said she believed Martin tried to hand the case over to another office. 
“Other DAs were not willing to take cases from her, for whatever reason, but I did know she tried to conflict it out,” Shoushtari said. 
Shoushtari no longer works for Martin’s office, saying she was let go in September of 2024 after “butting heads because I disagreed with the way she was running the office.” Shoushtari is now a deputy district attorney for the 10th Judicial District overseeing De Baca, Harding and Quay counties. 
The second case involves Valentino Roderick Johnson, now 30, who was arrested by McKinley County Sheriff’s deputies on Oct. 28, 2023. According to police reports, a passerby saw a car crash and said he came upon Johnson, heavily intoxicated and on top of a woman screaming for help and banging on the horn, saying that Johnson had raped her. 
Just over a week later, Martin dismissed the case, writing “this complaint is dismissed without prejudice, for reason, conflict for District Attorney’s Office.” 
In the news release, the New Mexico DOJ says that “Martin indicated the defendant was a friend of her children.” 
“Whether it was negligent or intentional, I find it unacceptable that DA Martin dismissed this case [Valentino Roderick Johnson] due to a personal connection to the suspect and it was never refiled,” said McKinley County Sheriff James Maiorano III in a statement. “The victim in this case deserves better, the deputies that worked this case deserve better, and the community deserves better. We are thankful to the NMDOJ for helping us to seek justice.”

During the summer, Trump’s administration sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. A federal judge in California on Tuesday ruled that the move violated a federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement.
Shapiro noted the ruling and the president’s rhetoric as a reason for the state to be preparing for Trump potentially sending National Guard personnel to Pennsylvania.
“I’m the former chief law enforcement officer of this commonwealth, and I understand what communities need to do to make people safe,” Shapiro said. “As governor, we’ve invested millions of dollars in not only policing, but in community organizations that have helped bring down violent crime by 42%.”

“Now is not a time to disrupt that with distrust, the way the president is doing in other communities,” he added. “Now is the time for us to continue making the progress we’re making here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I’m going to focus on that, but our teams are prepared for whatever the White House may try and send our way.”
Following the ruling from Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer in California, Democratic elected officials in the Golden State celebrated the decision.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sued to block Trump’s federalization of the state’s National Guard, said the ruling “sided with democracy and the Constitution” and echoed Breyer’s warning about Trump leading a national police force. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused the White House of trying to “invade the second largest city in the country.”
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandan Johnson, both Democrats, have also been outspoken in their opposition to the prospect of the National Guard being sent to Chicago.
“To Chicagoans, what you can do is look out for your communities and your neighbors. Know your rights. Film things that you see happening in your neighborhoods and streets and share them with the news media,” Pritzker said on Tuesday afternoon. “Authoritarians thrive on your silence. Be loud for America.”
Trump has mentioned multiple cities, including Chicago and Baltimore, as potential areas he could send troops to in an effort to combat crime. An FBI report released last month shows violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
Troops are currently patrolling Washington D.C., under what President Trump called a crime emergency. He was able to mobilize the District of Columbia, because the district is not a state.
D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, an elected official, has written on X, formerly Twitter, that the Trump administration’s “actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”
“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,” Schwalb said.
However, not all elected officials have criticized Trump’s efforts in the nation’s capital. Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, spoke positively about the impact of Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement officers, NBC News reports, although she also claimed that the presence of masked ICE agents and National Guard members “is not working.”
The ruling by Breyer on Tuesday morning that Trump could not use the National Guard for a wide array of police activities in California will go into effect Sept. 12.
However, it is likely that Trump will appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The president secured a victory in an earlier case in that court.
As budget impasse goes beyond 2 months, Shapiro says differences are being narrowed
During Shapiro’s visit to Murrell Dobbins CTE High School on Tuesday, he participated in a panel discussion with American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. He also told reporters that he was heading back to Harrisburg on Tuesday afternoon to meet with leaders to continue discussions about the state budget.
“It’s time for them to make some tough decisions to close this out,” Shapiro said. “The issues have been narrowed. They’ve got to make tough decisions and get this done.”
“It’s been 210 days since I introduced my budget. The Senate’s only come to work 26 times since then,” he added. “They’ve got to come back to Harrisburg, do their jobs and pass a budget that includes funding for mass transit.”
Shapiro said he’s “deeply concerned” about the impact of the service cuts from SEPTA on the Philadelphia-region.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Scott Martin, a Republican from Lancaster County, told NBC10 on Aug. 28 that a long-term solution for SEPTA was “not going to happen.”
Shapiro said that he was not going to negotiate the topic of a short term vs long term solution on SEPTA and mass transit funding through the media.
“The caucus that Senator Pittman leads, the Republican caucus in the Senate, has very different views than the Democratic caucus that Leader Bradford leads in the House of Representatives,” Shapiro said. “I’ve been working hard to go back and forth between them to find that common ground, to help our rural brothers and sisters understand that the strength of Philadelphia helps drive our economy, and in many ways, the strength of Philadelphia is predicated upon having a strong mass transit system.”
“I’ve tried to remind all the leaders and the lawmakers that mass transit is an issue that affects us in all 67 counties. I’ve tried to remind them that thanks to our investments in public education, as you’ve heard here today, we’re making significant progress,” he added. “We’ve got to keep making those investments. I’m confident we’ll get there, but finding that common ground between the two leaders, between the two caucuses, is a challenge. We’re going to get there.”
Shapiro wouldn’t get into the details of internal discussions and what the main sticking points were, but said it was his job to find enough Republican and Democratic votes in both chambers to come to a budget agreement.
“I’m confident we can get there, but these two leaders need to make some tough decisions,” he said. “Part of the decisions they need to make are quieting some of the extreme voices within their own caucus.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguard_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

(Photo bySara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado chapter of the National Rifle Association sued state leadership Tuesday over a sweeping firearm regulation that will require Coloradans to take safety courses to purchase most semiautomatic rifles starting next August.
The Colorado State Shooting Association argues in its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Denver, that Senate Bill 25-3 is unconstitutional on Second Amendment grounds and will not hold up under recent judicial precedent related to firearm laws.
“The Act’s cumbersome and expensive pre-purchase training and certification requirements are also designed to effectively stall, if not stop entirely, those trying to exercise their Second Amendment protected rights,” the lawsuit says.

In addition to CSSA, the plaintiffs include a domestic violence survivor, firearms instructor, wounded Air Force veteran with limited hand mobility, former law enforcement officer, CSSA board member who feels that his identity as a gay Jewish man make him a target for hate crimes, and 19-year-old man who intends to buy a gun in Colorado when he turns 21.
Democratic lawmakers passed SB-3 this year as one of the most comprehensive changes to firearm purchasing requirements in the state’s history. It applies to semiautomatic rifles, shotguns or handguns with detachable magazines and establishes a permit-to-purchase system for those types of guns. It also bans rapid-fire trigger devices.
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Tom Sullivan of Centennial, Sen. Julie Gonzales of Denver, Rep. Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Rep. Meg Froelich of Englewood, all Democrats.
“They haven’t been successful with their lawsuits in the past and I’m confident that the legislation we passed will stand up to their complaints in a court of law,” Sullivan wrote in a text message to Colorado Newsline.
Froelich said sponsors expect legal challenges when they run “meaningful gun violence prevention legislation,” and they write the policy to withstand those challenges.
A federal judge sided with the state on a challenge to its minimum purchasing age law earlier this summer.
Other states require safety training
Coloradans will need to get an eligibility card from their county sheriff, complete safety training and score at least 90% on a test to be able to purchase SB-3-covered guns. The length of that training will depend on whether the person has already completed a hunter education course through Colorado Parks and Wildlife.
It is not yet clear how much the process could cost from start to finish. During debate on the bill, Republicans argued that an already-strained CPW could not absorb increased demand for hunter safety courses.
The lawsuit alleges that the process will impose onerous requirements on the plaintiff’s right to own common firearms used for self defense.
“The Act infringes on the individual Plaintiffs’ ability to do so by prohibiting the acquisition and possession of particular firearms and firearm-related equipment, and by imposing a pre-purchase permitting scheme that consists of a complicated and multilayered application process, lengthy wait times, extensive course requirements, and numerous and costly fees,” it says.
The requirements do not apply for the purchase of semi-automatic firearms with permanently attached magazines that comply with the state’s ammunition limits.
The lawsuit also alleges that there is no historical tradition for this type of regulation, so the law will not hold up in the context of U.S. Supreme Court decisions like New York Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen from 2022. Ten states require gun buyers to complete safety training, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ office declined to comment on the pending litigation. In his signing statement for the bill, however, Polis wrote that the bill “ensures that our Second Amendment rights are protected and that Coloradans can continue to purchase the gun of their choice for sport, hunting, self defense, or home defense.”
CSSA is using lawyers from Mountain States Legal Foundation, the firm behind a challenge against New Mexico’s gun purchase waiting period law. A panel of federal appellate judges recently decided that the law is likely unconstitutional and sent the question back to the lower court.
The plaintiffs in the Colorado case are demanding a jury trial.

(Photo by Shannon Hahh for The Madison County Record)This story first appeared in the Madison County Record and is republished here, with light editing, by permission.
A decertification hearing for a former Madison County sheriff’s deputy who didn’t respond to a 911 call has been postponed, according to an Arkansas Department of Public Safety spokesperson.
The hearing to strip former deputy Blake Hassell of his law enforcement credential had been scheduled for Sept. 9, but the Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Training (CLEST) hearing is being rescheduled due to “some administrative delays unrelated to the case,” according to Nick Gentry, DPS deputy communications director for the Department of Public Safety and Shared Services Division. 
CLEST may revoke a law enforcement officer’s certification after written notice and hearing if the commission finds an officer has broken the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics. 
Madison County Sheriff Ronnie Boyd requested Hassell’s decertification in November, stating Hassell did not respond to a 911 call placed Aug. 5, 2024, in which a caller reported a woman yelling for help. Hassell initially said he had responded, but when questioned about the call, he admitted he had not.
Five weeks after the call, human remains were found in the area of the 911 call.
CLEST voted in January to proceed with a hearing. Hassell’s attorney, Christopher Plumlee, said at the time that Hassell intended to contest any challenge to his certification as well as defend his name and reputation. 
Gentry said neither Hassell nor Boyd requested the delay.
 Parole officer’s body found

	 
On Sept. 5, 2024, a parole and probation officer reported Taylor Barksdale was missing. Boyd said he began investigating her disappearance on Sept. 6, 2024.
After finding human remains on Sept. 9, 2024, and opening a potential homicide investigation, Boyd identified the remains as belonging to Barksdale. 
A press release from the sheriff’s office about a potential homicide appears to have been written and saved on Sept. 13, 2024. However, Boyd delayed sending the release until Sept. 18, 2024, just a few hours after The Record submitted a public records’ request for information about human remains being found in the Kingston area.
Boyd has stated several times that more information will be presented at the decertification hearing as to why neither he nor Sgt. Drew Scott, Hassell’s immediate supervisor, responded on Aug. 5, 2024, the day they learned Hassell had not. 
“More of that stuff’s going to be figured out in the decertification hearing,” Boyd said. He said he had a “thought process” as to why he did not respond, adding, “at this point, I don’t think I need to elaborate on that at that moment.”
In January, Boyd said no one from the sheriff’s office followed up because the call, “was an emergency call and, you know, we didn’t receive another call after that.”
Barksdale’s case remains an open investigation. No arrests have been made. 
Fourth Judicial District Prosecuting Attorney Brandon Carter said providing any updates on the investigation would be detrimental to the case. 
The Barksdale family met with Carter two weeks ago, requesting a copy of the autopsy report from the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory, which they say Boyd has refused to release. The family also asked for more involvement from the Arkansas State Police in the case.
Carter said he had no comment on the meeting, the autopsy report or the state police’s involvement. 
“My conversations with the family are going to stay between me and the family,” Carter said. 
Sammi Wilmoth, attorney for the Barksdale family, also declined to comment on the meeting.  Wilmoth said the family is “hopeful that whoever committed this crime will be held accountable. We’re still hopeful that will happen.” 
Aug. 5, 2024, 911 Call 
Kortney Cline said she called 911 on Aug. 5, 2024, at 12:34 a.m.  
The sheriff’s office’s “dispatch call detail” report shows Cline told dispatchers that she “heard a woman in the woods behind her house yelling. Stated she believes at one point the woman screamed ‘help.’ Caller advised there is not a physical address. But it is an area where a bunch of homeless people were camped out.”
The sheriff’s office declined a public records request by The Record to release the audio of the 911 call, stating it was part of an open investigation. 
Matt Durrett, former prosecuting attorney for Washington and Madison counties, told another media outlet in September 2024: “The caller reported that she could hear a woman screaming and it sounded as if she were in distress. Sounded, perhaps she was being beaten or being tortured.”
Hassell initially said he responded, and the dispatch report shows a notation that the call was closed at 1:14 a.m. with the notation, “No signs of anyone here.”
After confronting Hassell about the 911 call and learning Hassell had not responded, Scott wrote a “verbal counseling” statement.
Scott’s statement tendered to CLEST was dated Aug. 6. That same statement, given to The Record, showed a marking through the number 6 with  “corrected date 5” written.
In that statement, Scott wrote he asked Hassell why he did not respond. The statement notes Hassell told Scott that he “was just out in the area approximately 30 minutes to an hour prior [to the 911 call] and did not hear anything.”
In a statement written by the sheriff, dated Sept. 17, 2024, and submitted to CLEST, Boyd said he informed Hassell on Sept. 11, 2024, that he was working on a missing person case involving a woman who could have been the person yelling for help. 
“I informed him that all signs were leading back to the night of the call that he failed to respond and lied, saying he did,” Boyd wrote. 
Boyd wrote that he told Hassell he “did not see any possible way” that Hassell could remain employed by the sheriff’s office.
Hassell asked for “further consideration on the matter,” Boyd wrote.
“After taking some additional time, I came to the same conclusion that Deputy Hassell could no longer be an effective representative of the Sheriff’s Office,” Boyd wrote.
In a text message last year, Hassell denied lying.
“I was honest about why I did not respond from the very first time I was asked about it,” Hassell wrote.
Last year, when The Record asked Boyd what Hassell said when Boyd confronted him about not responding, Boyd said, “I never got a good answer.”
According to employment records submitted to CLEST, Hassell worked for the Springdale Police Department from Aug. 5, 2019,  to July 29, 2021. 
Hassell was hired by the Madison County Sheriff’s Office on April 3, 2024, and resigned Sept. 11, 2024, in lieu of being fired. 
Hassell did not respond to a request by The Record for comment for this article. 
Hassell’s Statements
Last September, when asked about the 911 call, Hassell told The Record he didn’t know anything about it nor Barksdale’s death. He later issued a statement to The Record saying he was at the location twice prior to the 911 call and there were no signs of anyone being there. 
If Hassell was in the area prior to the 911 call, Cline said, “he didn’t come down my road.”
Hassell said the residents of the area “were known to be off their medication and not in their proper state of mind,” and “screaming and chasing objects that are not there.”
Cline said when she placed the call, she didn’t identify anyone by name or refer to anyone on medications.
Hassell said that at the time of the 911 call, he was working a “very high priority investigation.”
“Due to my past experience of false 911 calls at that location and vagueness of the call, it was not determined to be a high priority at the time,” Hassell wrote in a previous text message to The Record. 
Cline has made several calls to the sheriff’s office over the course of several years. 
But, she said, “There’s no abuse of 911.” 
In January, Boyd issued a response to Hassell’s statement about false 911 calls. 
“I want to clarify that the Madison County Sheriff’s Office has never said that there was a history of 911 calls from the residence of the caller,” Boyd wrote.
“We have no record of there being any intentionally false emergency calls from that residence. Frequently, the caller and law enforcement cannot determine if there is an actual emergency until someone gets on the scene,” Boyd said. 
In Boyd’s Sept. 17, 2024, statement the sheriff said Hassell was “counseled on the importance of answering calls and not letting past incidents cloud present events.”
Cline has been the subject of podcasts and Facebook accounts criticizing her for allegedly calling 911 numerous times. She said she worries the criticism could scare people away from making future 911 calls when needed. 
She said she had been told by the sheriff’s office that law enforcement needs to have “just cause” to investigate and “can’t just pull up on” residents in the camper that was near her home.  
She said the Aug. 5 call provided reason for someone from the sheriff’s office to come to the area and “nobody did.”
Caller Follows Up
Cline said she felt the screams for help she heard on Aug. 5, 2024, constituted an emergency when she made the initial 911 call.
“I do know I absolutely wasn’t like, ‘I don’t know, you might should come,’” she said.
She said she heard the screams throughout the night, so she called again — and again, she said, no one responded. 
Boyd has stated repeatedly that no evidence of a second 911 call exists.
“I know I called a second time” Cline said, “because I talked to a male and a female,” two different dispatchers. 
Madison County time sheet records show dispatchers Collin Kilbourn and Mickayla Littrell worked the night of Aug. 5. 
“The reason I know there’s a second call is because the girl told me, when I said, ‘No one came,’ she said, ‘Yes, he did. He was there, and he knocked on their front door and no one answered,’” Cline said. 
“And I said, ‘Well, then this is how I know you’re wrong. There is no front door. They’re in a camper.’ So I’m sure about that,” Cline said. 
Cline also followed up again mid-morning on Aug. 5, 2024, sending Boyd an email about no one responding. Cline told Boyd she called 911 because she could hear a woman screaming. 
“I don’t know how she was being assaulted, but the screaming went on for hours,” she wrote to Boyd. Cline told Boyd she waited until 3 a.m. thinking an officer would respond.
“No one showed up,” she wrote. 
She told Boyd she was frustrated because a legitimate reason existed for the sheriff’s office to investigate but nobody responded. 
In a response email approximately 30 minutes later, Boyd wrote, “We had a deputy go out there around 1:14 AM, and he did not see any signs of anyone in the area. I haven’t been able to talk to him, so I can’t give you any details further than that.”
Cline emailed back, telling Boyd she appreciated him getting back to her, and wrote, “I assure you, no one came.”
Cline said she didn’t hear from Boyd again until he showed up at her house letting her know that they had found “the girl I called about.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250826-Madison-County-Sheriffs-Office-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

Free.,Judges in two federal cases cite due process to block Trump immigration moves,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judges-two-federal-cases-cite-due-process-block-trump-immigration-moves,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of federal court rulings over the Labor Day weekend invalidated aggressive actions the Trump administration had taken on immigration enforcement.Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ordered an unknown number of planes carrying unaccompanied Guatemalan children temporarily halted on Sunday, two days after Judge Jia Cobb struck down a policy used to bypass judicial review in quick removals of migrants far from the southern border. Both judges are of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.The rulings are part of an ongoing clash between President Donald Trump and the federal judiciary over the administration’s immigration crackdown. Judges have raised concerns that immigrants’ due process rights are being violated.On Sunday, Sooknanan voiced concern for unaccompanied children’s due process rights, and temporarily halted planes carrying the minors from taking off. The administration had planned to deport 10 children to their home country of Guatemala. The case resembled one earlier this year in which a judge ordered planes carrying Venezuelan men removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 grounded. Despite the order, multiple planes landed in El Salvador where more than 200 Venezuelans were sent to a notorious mega-prison.The 10 children, nationals of Guatemala, on the planes ranged in age from 10 to 17 and crossed the southern border alone. Attorneys in court filings stressed that the children had immigration cases pending before a judge and that the children expressed fear of returning to Guatemala. ‘Everyone would be at risk’The order followed Cobb’s order Friday granting a request from immigration rights groups to halt the implementation of a new policy that expanded expedited removal.The administration has expanded the use of expedited removal, which allows for the quick removal of migrants, as a pillar of its aim to carry out mass deportations of people without permanent legal status. For decades, administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, they are subject to a fast-track deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.The Trump administration in January expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.In Cobb’s Friday opinion, she wrote that the administration likely violated the rights of immigrants and approached a universal violation of the constitutional right to due process. Former President Joe Biden appointed Cobb in 2021.“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” she wrote. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.” Flights of Guatemalan minors groundedIn a flurry of action Sunday, Sooknanan temporarily halted the deportation of the children for 14 days while the case continues after an emergency request from the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.Attorneys from NILC argued that if the children were returned, they could face violence and the administration's move to deport them violated immigration procedures for unaccompanied minors.“Defendants are imminently planning to illegally transfer Plaintiffs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement … custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests,” the attorneys wrote in their emergency filing.The 10 children on the planes were taken off and put back into the custody of  the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to a status update filed Monday by NILC lawyers.The Trump administration has identified up to 600 Guatemalan children to be removed under a pilot program created through an agreement with Guatemala, according to the court filings. Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Biden also appointed Sooknanan.Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, told the New York Times in an interview that the initiative began when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala in July. He added there is an agreement for Guatemala to accept more than 600 children. DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.The State Department’s 2024 report on Guatemala details human rights concerns such as violence, and advises against traveling to the country. The case involving the unaccompanied children was reassigned to judge Timothy James Kelly, whom Trump appointed in 2017.",,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

All successful. They went very well, like this is going very well. And then I didn't do any for two days, and they said, ‘There must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn't do them for months. You wouldn't see him.”Trump then said that he had heard about the online speculation of his death, but that he didn’t realize how extensive the rumors were.“No, I heard that. I get reports,” Trump said. “Now you knew I did an interview that lasted for about an hour and a half with somebody, and everybody saw. That was on one of your competitors. I did numerous shows, and also did a number of truths, long truths. I think, pretty poignant truths. No, I was very active over the weekend.”Trump added a few moments later: “I didn't hear that one. That's pretty serious stuff.”The rumors that Trump had potentially died began circulating online Friday but began dissipating on Saturday, Sunday and Monday after the group of reporters that follows the president around saw him walk into his golf club in Virginia each of those three days.",,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)OKLAHOMA CITY — Spending on crime, incarceration, and corrections would be reduced in Oklahoma if the minimum wage were raised to $15, according to a report. 
Higher wages could help break the “cycle of poverty and incarceration” while reducing the burden on law enforcement, according to a report from This Land Research and Communications Collaborative, a nonpartisan research group. The report was compiled by Scioto Analysis, a public policy analysis firm.  
“We find that a $15 minimum wage could yield significant public safety benefits for Oklahoma, particularly by reducing violent crime and its associated human and economic toll,” the report found. “These effects are most concentrated among young, low-wage populations and may help mitigate some of the state’s historically high incarceration rates while promoting reintegration into the workforce.”
Voters will decide whether or not to raise Oklahoma’s minimum wage  in the June 2026 primary election. If approved by voters, State Question 832 would gradually increase the $7.25 an hour minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2029. Additional increases would be tied to the cost of living measured by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index.
Oklahoma would see 7,000 less crimes per year, or a decrease of 3%, the report predicts. Most of these are estimated to be property crimes. 
The state would have to increase police forces by 11%, or about 1,000 officers, to achieve the same result. This would cost Oklahoma about $58 million per year, the report found. 
“These findings make clear that raising wages is not only an economic issue, but a public safety issue,” said Rob Moore, principal researcher for Scioto Analysis. “When people can earn a fair wage, they are less likely to be pushed toward crime and more likely to build stable, thriving lives. This new analysis clearly shows raising the minimum wage isn’t just about higher wages, it’s about building better, safer communities, while saving taxpayers millions of dollars.” 
The decrease in crime would reduce the incarcerated population by about 370 people per year and lower recidivism by about 6%, according to the report’s estimates. This could save Oklahoma’s correctional system $5.7 million annually. 
Oklahoma had the fifth-highest incarceration rate in the U.S. as of 2022, the report found.

(Photo courtesy of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Newport County)The State Properties Committee voted Tuesday to transfer the ownership of an addition to a community center in Newport’s north end from the Rhode Island Department of Education to the local public housing authority. The transfer is necessary to comply with requirements for using federal pandemic relief money to renovate the site.
“These funds really allow us to transform that building, modernize it for 21st century learning,”Rhonda Mitchell, executive director for the Housing Authority of Newport, told the committee.
The unanimous decision returns the vacant “Gallagher Wing” of the Florence Gray Center on York Street back to the Housing Authority of Newport so plans can proceed to renovate the center into an Aquidneck Island community hub.
That will allow the authority to access all $7.5 million in Community Learning Center Municipal Grants awarded in 2024 for capital projects that must be completed by October 2026. The money comes from the American Public Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
The work includes upgrades to the interior layout, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, interior finishes, fixtures and equipment. The wing will get a new interior staircase and hallways, along with a tele-medicine room, two computer labs, four multipurpose rooms, and seven classrooms.
“We’ve got a construction team lined up ready to work,”Mitchell said in an interview after the vote.
The Rhode Island Department of Education has owned the center’s Gallagher Wing since 2011 when construction began on the Met School’s Paul W. Crowley East Bay Campus next door to the community center. The Met is a network of six small, public high schools in Providence and Newport. 
At the time, the state-operated Met Center planned to use the two-story Gallagher Wing to hold classes, offices, and other school functions, according to a letter from the RIDE Chief Operating Officer Mario Carreño to the committee.
But the Met Center has hardly used the space, Carreño wrote. And because the federal grant does not cover renovations in existing school buildings, the Housing Authority would only be able to fix around 80% of the building.
“It would be just left vacant if it weren’t transferred,” Carreño told the committee.
Mitchell called the reacquisition “a huge milestone” as the authority has sought to upgrade the building since 2017. 
Community Learning Center Municipal Grants have provided $81.7 million to Rhode Island cities and towns to renovate, add on to or build new buildings, such as recreation centers, community centers, wellness hubs and libraries.
As of mid-July, the state’s website notes that a little over $540,000 of the total $7.5 million had been spent on the project, mostly toward contractors’ architectural and engineering fees. 
With the project completion deadline now 13 months away, the building as of Tuesday is   fully under the authority’s control. 
A copy of the state’s transfer deal was not immediately made available. Carreño told the committee that while the agreement carries no cost, the state will require the Housing Authority of Newport to keep the space off the market for the next 10 years.
Mitchell said she does not anticipate such a sale would ever happen.
“We would envision that it’s always a community center,” she said. 
The building has several tenants including Fab Newport, the East Bay Community Action Program, Turning Around Ministries, and Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County.

,DC,2025-09-02 20:47:44+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump moves Space Command from Colorado to Alabama, capping yearslong fight",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-moves-space-command-colorado-alabama-capping-yearslong-fight,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Tuesday the U.S. Space Command will permanently relocate to Huntsville, Alabama, vacating its temporary headquarters in Colorado.The move reverts back to Trump’s plans during his first administration to locate the combatant command in Alabama to oversee Space Force, the military branch he created in 2019. Space Force headquarters has since operated out of Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. The command’s location has been a yearslong political fight.“As you know, this has been going on for a long period of time, and I am thrilled to report that the U.S. Space Command headquarters will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as ‘Rocket City,’” said Trump, flanked by Alabama Republicans in the Oval Office Tuesday afternoon. “We love Alabama. I only won it by about 47 points. I don't think that influenced my decision though,” he said. (Trump won Alabama’s nine Electoral College votes in November by 31 percentage points, according to The Associated Press. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won Colorado’s 10 Electoral College votes by 11 percentage points.)Trump said his plans to root Space Command at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville were “wrongfully obstructed by the Biden administration.”The Biden administration decided in July 2023 to keep Space Command in Colorado Springs to ensure “peak readiness in the space domain,” according to a Department of Defense Inspector General report released in April 2025. The IG’s report was inconclusive on why the Air Force did not push back on the decision, despite the department’s preference for Alabama.“Today, we're moving forward with what we want to do and the place that we want to have this, and this will be there for hopefully hundreds of years,” Trump said. “I will say, I want to thank Colorado. The problem I have with Colorado, one of the big problems, they do mail-in voting. They went to all mail-in voting, so they have automatically crooked elections.”Since his election loss to Biden in 2020, Trump has repeated unfounded claims about mail-in ballots and their effect on elections.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the president is “restoring (Space Command) to precisely where it should be.”“Whoever controls the skies will control the future of warfare, and Mr. President, today you're ensuring that happens,” Hegseth said.Alabama Republicans rejoice over Space CommandAlabama’s Republican U.S. Sens. Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt both praised the president as they stood beside him in the Oval Office.“Mr. President, we are grateful for your leadership on this and restoring Space Command to its rightful home in Huntsville, Alabama,” Britt said, adding the accusation that “obviously the Biden administration chose to make this political.”Tuberville said the move will save taxpayers $480 million. States Newsroom has not independently verified that figure, and the April IG report did not cite specific relocation costs. He also highlighted the presence of NASA in Huntsville as an advantage.“I spoke with the president for the last three or four years about this. If I thought it needed to go somewhere else, because (of) the security of our country, I'd be for that. But the best place for Space Command is Huntsville, Alabama, because what we have and what it means to this country is going to be so important,” Tuberville said.Lawsuit vowed by Colorado AGBut Colorado elected officials aren’t backing down. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, described the decision as “deeply disappointing” for his state and “a waste of taxpayer dollars.”Colorado’s Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement Tuesday that he plans to take the administration to court over the “unlawful” relocation, which he described as “political games.”“Moving Space Command Headquarters to Alabama is not only wrong for our national defense, but it’s harmful to hundreds of Space Command personnel and their families. These El Paso County residents are our neighbors. They relied on the federal government’s decision to keep Space Command HQ in Colorado Springs — they bought homes for their families, selected schools for their children, and have contributed to the local economy.” Weiser said. “The Colorado Attorney General’s Office has been preparing in the event the president made such an unlawful decision to move Space Command HQ. If the Trump administration takes this step — I’m prepared to challenge it in court.”Colorado’s entire bipartisan congressional delegation released a statement Tuesday slamming the relocation announcement.“Today’s decision to move U.S. Space Command’s headquarters out of Colorado and to Alabama will directly harm our state and the nation. We are united in fighting to reverse this decision. Bottom line—moving Space Command headquarters weakens our national security at the worst possible time,” according to the statement.",,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

(File photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A new committee formed to investigate New Hampshire domestic violence fatalities will begin meeting this fall and will initially focus on a high-profile murder suicide in Berlin this summer, the Department of Justice announced Tuesday.
The Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committee, created this year by Senate Bill 140, is charged with carrying out “comprehensive, multidisciplinary reviews” of domestic violence-related deaths, according to the statute. Those reviews are meant to evaluate the responses of police and government agencies, identify barriers to victim safety, and produce recommendations to improve the systems.
On July 6, Michael Gleason Jr. shot and killed his estranged wife, Marisol Fuentes-Huaracha, and then fatally shot himself at a restaurant in Berlin, police say. Gleason had been released on cash bail despite facing serious domestic violence charges months earlier, and was supposed to have relinquished his firearms as part of a protective order. The murder has sparked political outrage and a damning internal review by the judicial branch that found multiple points of failure among the courts to prevent the tragedy.
According to the Department of Justice, the committee’s 17 members include several state officials, such as Attorney General John Formella; Chief Medical Examiner Jennie Duval; Director of the Division for Behavioral Health Katja Fox; and Mike Donati, chief of the Bureau of Community, Family and Program Supports at the Division for Children, Youth and Families.
Circuit Court Administrative Judge Ellen Christo will represent the judicial branch and Deanna Campbell, the managing attorney of the New Hampshire Public Defender, will also serve. 
The list also includes representatives from domestic violence prevention organizations, such as the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, Ending the Violence, and WISE. It also has law enforcement members representing the New Hampshire State Police, Manchester Police Department, and the Jackson Police Department, and two assistant county attorneys from Cheshire and Merrimack counties.
The announcement said the committee would review the Fuentes-Huaracha case first at the request of Gov. Kelly Ayotte. 
But Formella said the committee had broad goals, noting that “more than half” of homicides handled by his office relate to domestic violence.
“Each of these tragedies has a devastating impact — not only on the families and friends of the victims, but on the broader community,” he said. “The work of this committee is designed to ensure that we are learning from these cases, strengthening our systems, and doing everything we can to prevent future fatalities. With this membership in place, New Hampshire is taking an important step forward in strengthening our response to domestic violence.”
The committee will hold its first meeting in September or October, the announcement said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/formellaydc-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

On Tuesday, Ann Arbor for Public Power announced that its members are drafting a ballot proposal for the November 2026 election, asking voters to create a new board of public electric utility, before taking over infrastructure from DTE Energy at a later date. 
DTE Energy is one of the largest energy utilities in the state and has faced frequent criticism for high rates and unreliable electricity. According to the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, an energy utility watchdog, DTE customers experienced an average of 1,542 minutes without power in 2023, ranking among the worst utilities in the nation for outages.

In its announcement, the group argued that shifting energy to a public power utility would be highly likely to provide more reliable, more renewable, and less costly power to Ann Arbor residents.  
“The first question for voters is: do you want this? The plan is to create the board of the public utility in the 2026 election, before taking over poles and wires from DTE. Creating the board will cost the people of Ann Arbor zero dollars, and it will put the process of dumping DTE in motion,” Ann Arbor For Public Power’s Executive Director Brian Geiringer said in a statement. 
After language for the effort is approved, the group will need to gather 5,000 signatures to have the matter placed on the ballot. 
DTE did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

Unions across Brown University and its health care network have banded together to form a new labor federation with about 7,000 members total.
In a Monday announcement, the Brown University Labor Council (BULC) branded itself as “the first effort at creating a cross-sector labor organization” since the Ivy League school merged with Lifespan to form Brown University Health last summer.  
The council’s president, Maddock Thomas, said in a statement that it will work to unify Brown workers across any respective labor campaigns, contract talks, and picket lines. Beginning Sept. 15, the council plans to hold a series of educational events on labor organization to help workers get involved in their unions and organize their workplaces.
“In this time of overlapping crises, the voice of labor is crucial,” Thomas wrote. “A strong labor movement means that working people will have a seat at the table as we work to solve these problems. The BULC allows us to build a cohesive labor movement for workers affiliated with Brown across all sectors and workplaces.”
Labor organizations in the council include:

Brown chapter of American Association of University Professors
Brown University Postdoc Labor Organization
Brown Health and Care New England units of Committee of Interns and Residents
Graduate Labor Organization
Brown Student Labor Alliance
Transdev and Rhode Island Hospital units of Teamsters Local 251 
United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP) Local 5098
Library and dining units of United Service and Allied Workers of Rhode Island

The federation wants to align and coordinate union activities and contract timelines, and intends to pursue joint bargaining efforts, according to its website.
The federation’s constitution details that each member union gets two voting delegates on the council. Those delegates can vote for the  federation’s executive board, which includes a president, secretary-treasurer, and two vice presidents. Meetings will typically be monthly, according to the constitution.
The council cited uncertainty about federal health care and higher ed funding among reasons for the group’s formation. The council’s statement also took aim at Brown’s recent handshake with the federal government. The school settled with the feds in July to conclude three separate investigations into alleged civil rights violations on campus, including the use of race-conscious admissions and accusations of a climate of antisemitism on campus. 
Brown agreed to end race-conscious admissions as part of the agreement. While the university maintains that the July agreement will not impact academic freedom on campus, the agreement has also drawn criticism because it requires the school to employ binary definitions of gender in student athletics, locker rooms and dormitories. The university also needs to submit detailed annual reports on admissions data and provides new avenues for students to report suspected antisemitism on campus. 
The agreement with the feds “abandons much of the University’s core educational mission and puts community members at risk,” the labor council’s announcement stated.

Josh Stein signs an executive order on state government's use of artificial intelligence on Sept. 2, 2025. (Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday he is creating a council to study and begin using artificial intelligence within state government, signing an executive order and sketching out what he described as a years-long plan to use the technology for “economic growth and attract innovation.”
The AI announcement came alongside another long-term blueprint to attract business in the biotech industry, as well as a plan to make North Carolina’s public schools “the best in the country.”
Stein’s Tuesday order creates a leadership council that will study how state workers should use AI. It will be chaired by Lee Lilley, the secretary of the Department of Commerce, and Teena Piccione, the secretary of the Department of Information Technology who joined the administration from a senior leadership role at Google.
Piccione’s department will also house a new “AI accelerator,” which will “explore and implement AI solutions to real world problems,” Piccione said. And state agencies will each have an “oversight team” guiding proper uses of AI.
The goal, she said, was to make North Carolina the “most AI-literate state government workforce in the nation.”

Still, she and the governor acknowledged that uncertainty reigns as states grapple with AI’s limits and flaws. It presents “serious risks” alongside “extraordinary possibilities,” Stein said, and added that the state had created a “framework” to help guide state workers on how to use, or not use, the technology. He pointed to agencies like the bogged-down DMV that he believes could be more efficient at “getting people through the system quicker.”
What does that mean for state workers whose jobs could heavily overlap with AI usage? Nothing right now, Stein said — though he acknowledged that could change in the future.
“I’m not denying that there may be employment consequences,” Stein said. “But we are nowhere near that at this point.”
Other sectors of North Carolina government have already ventured into AI usage and policy. State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office partnered with OpenAI earlier this year in an effort to make parts of that office’s work more efficiently. And state lawmakers have filed more than two dozen bills on the topic so far this session: dealing with everything from algorithmic rent fixing to AI ethics and literacy in K-12 education.
Governments across the U.S. at all levels have begun to lean more into AI use — and regulation. Many cities have developed “guidelines” to steer workers’ use of AI. Congress, as members debated what would become a massive tax and spending bill, weighed banning states from regulating AI. That language was stripped out before the package became law.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia Public Service Commission last week denied a bulk of the power rate increase requested by Appalachian Power according to an order filed by the PSC on Thursday evening.
Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power, subsidiaries of American Electric Power, were seeking a $250.5 million increase that would have made residential customers pay about $24 more on their monthly bills. 
The PSC, in its order Thursday, denied all but about $76 million of the companies’ request. For now, that $76.1 million increase will not come out of customers’ pockets, according to the order.
The PSC said another decision will be forthcoming regarding a plan by Appalachian Power to securitize some of the company’s assets through the issuance of bonds to help increase revenue. That proposal, per the order, would spread costs out over an extended period of time in an attempt to lighten the burden put on individual customers.
If approved, the securitization plan could see customer bills increasing by about $7 a month. The bonds issued would be paid off by customers through this increase over the next 20 years.
“Thousands of West Virginians spoke out against unaffordable rate hikes and difficulty managing the ever-growing cost of energy, and the PSC’s decision reflects the power of public input to ease the burden on families,” Dani Parent, executive director of the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, said in a statement.
The rate increase was initially filed in November 2024 for the second time. A previous request from the company to raise rates was dismissed by the PSC last year due to it lacking adequate information.
Since last November, at least 5,081 residents have submitted letters of protest to the PSC regarding the requested rate hike. There were no letters sent to the agency in support of the increased rates.
“It goes to show you how engaged people are around these issues. More than 5,000 West Virginians took the time to speak out because they know what’s at stake. We think that’s more than any other case in PSC history,” said Courtney MacDonald with the West Virginians for Energy Freedom coalition. “Residents and businesses are tired of seeing their bills go up and paying for unreliable service. Keeping the lights on shouldn’t be a universal struggle.”
At the end of 2024, according to AEP, the company saw nearly $3 billion in profits for its shareholders.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.
West Virginia AEP customers have already undergone 14 rate increases from the company between 2017 and March 2023, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. In the last five years alone, according to Appalachian Power, residential rates for electricity have risen from $128.09 in March 2019 to $169.93 in June 2024. That’s a 32.6% increase in rates.
PSC order expands low-income assistance programs, more
In its order last week, the PSC also made moves to expand programs that assist low-income customers.
The agency made the Dollar Energy Fund, which helps qualifying residents pay utility costs and avoid shutoffs, available year-round instead of only in winter months. The PSC also increased the amount of money available to individuals from $300 up to $500.
The commission also lowered reconnection charges, meaning residents will have to pay less if their power is shut off due to nonpayment. Previously, reconnections could cost up to $75.
“Expanding the Dollar Energy Fund will provide significant relief for the West Virginians who need it most,” Parent said.
The PSC is also requiring AEP to study what the impact would be in offering discount power rates to low-income families during summer months. Currently, discount rates are only available in the winter.
In addition to requesting a rate increase, Appalachian Power had also asked the PSC to decrease net-metering credits that allow customers who install solar panels on their homes to sell the excess generated electricity back to the grid at retail price and lower their own utility costs. 
The proposal from AEP would have meant a near-67% decrease in what is currently paid for that power which would have been a detriment to solar production in the state, according to West Virginians for Energy Freedom.
The PSC did end 1:1 credits for net-metering, but the rate — as well as the time frame to be grandfathered into the program — were expanded. Residents will have a year longer than Appalachian Power requested to apply for the net-metering program and install solar on their homes. 
Residents who install solar power systems after that period ends and participate in net-metering will earn about 12.4 cents per a kilowatt hour generated, which is between 67% and 75% of the full retail rate.
“Although we are losing the 1:1 retail credit, The PSC’s decision on the new bill credit rate preserves the right of West Virginians’ to participate fairly in our energy system,” said Leah Turgeon, the state director for Solar United Neighbors in West Virginia. “Under this order, solar owners and those who wish to take control of where their energy comes from will continue to benefit from distributed solar power into the future — a win for West Virginia’s solar industry and residents alike.”

As Georgia Covid rates rise, people who want to get the latest vaccine as it hits pharmacy shelves over the coming weeks will likely face a new hitch: They’ll need a doctor’s prescription, at least for now.
Pharmacies became a key distributor of Covid shots during the pandemic, and many Georgians are used to getting annual flu and Covid shots there.
But uncertainty about how the federal government is regulating the newest Covid shots, which have been updated for the 2025-26 season and are starting to arrive in stores, has created a new wrinkle in that process.
Many pharmacies in Georgia said they will require a prescription for the shot until an influential federal committee meets and makes firm recommendations on who should get the vaccine, expected in September. Those pharmacies include CVS, as well as independent drugstores.
“Everyone will need a [prescription] until ACIP makes a recommendation,” said Dr. Johnathan Hamrick, a member of the board of directors of the Georgia Pharmacy Association who formerly taught pharmacy law at Mercer University and practices in metro Atlanta.
His colleague, Dr. Jonathan Marquess, who owns independent pharmacies and serves as vice president of the Academy of Independent Pharmacy for the state pharmacy association, agreed.
 CDC panel’s actions could decide access to shots

All eyes are on ACIP: the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It develops policies on vaccination in the United States as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s set to meet Sept. 18 and 19 in Atlanta.
The committee’s policies help govern how pharmacists in Georgia and many other states administer vaccines.
Under Georgia law, if ACIP has approved a vaccine, pharmacists can typically administer it, as long as they have an agreement with a supervising doctor, which most pharmacies do.
If ACIP votes to recommend the Covid vaccine for certain or most populations in the United States, that would allow pharmacists to go back to providing the shots without a prescription, Hamrick said, although how that will work for different age groups and categories of people will depend on the exact details of the new recommendations.
It’s not clear how the committee will vote. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services who has disrupted the vaccine system, dismissed the committee’s 17 members in June and appointed eight of his own picks, seven of whom remain.
Kennedy’s actions have drawn criticism and even lawsuits from professional medical societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Medical professionals and public health experts have raised concerns that the committee will curtail its recommendations for the vaccine to only certain populations, stymieing widespread access.
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the latest version of the shot, but with more restrictions on who should get it than last year, raising questions about access. But Georgia pharmacists, and many others, are waiting to see what the ACIP does in September.
“That’s what we’re all waiting on,” Hamrick said.
Marquess, who owns several independent pharmacies in Georgia, said he has ordered the shots and expects them in soon.
In Georgia, as of late last month, about 1.6% of emergency room visits were due to Covid, according to the latest data from the CDC, the highest rate since this time last year. And wastewater Covid levels have ticked up in Georgia from “very low” in mid-July to “moderate” as of late August, according to CDC data.
“Immunizations have been proven to be safe and effective and healthy to keep people [from getting] those terrible diseases,” Marquess said. During the most recent Covid season, from fall 2024 to spring 2025, only about 16% of Georgia adults got at least one shot, according to the CDC.
CVS, which has over 300 pharmacy locations in Georgia, has started receiving the new shots in stores, spokesperson Amy Thibault said. She did not directly answer a question about whether the chain had ordered fewer shots than last year but said it would have “ample supply” to meet the need.
People with a prescription will be able to get the shots at drugstores or at one of the company’s nearly 50 MinuteClinic locations in the state, Thibault said.
Representatives from Publix and Walgreens did not immediately respond to requests for information on how they are handling the shots.
 To be determined: insurance coverage for shots

Marquess said the pharmacists who work for him would typically be willing to put in a quick call to a patient’s doctor to get the needed approval, obviating the need for an office visit.
Thibault of CVS said it would vary by location as to whether pharmacists would call a patient’s doctor for them, or the patient would need to reach out directly.
“It makes it much simpler for the whole medical system if we can utilize our protocol and not call every time to get a prescription,” Marquess said.
Hamrick said it’s unclear how insurers will handle the cost, though they typically cover the shots recommended by ACIP.
The latest Covid vaccine will cost about $225 out-of-pocket at CVS stores, Thibault said.
The updated vaccines are not yet available at county health departments, said Georgia Department of Public Health spokesperson Eric Jens. He said each county’s health department places its own orders, “typically based on need.”
“Covid vaccinations are administered at public health departments by nurses working under protocols established by DPH. DPH does not require a prescription for Covid vaccines,” Jens said. “At this time, DPH does not know what the cost of the updated Covid vaccine will be for individuals without insurance.”
Much of the confusion could be resolved when ACIP meets this month. But turmoil at the CDC, including the ouster of newly appointed Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four senior officials citing political interference in the vaccine process, could affect the meeting.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary, has called on ACIP to “indefinitely delay” its meeting.
“Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed,” Cassidy said. “If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.”
No matter what ACIP does, Georgia pharmacists may have a legal pathway to providing the shots without an individual prescription “under Georgia law pursuant to vaccine protocol agreements,” said Greg Reybold, general counsel and vice president of public policy for the American Pharmacy Cooperative.
Meanwhile, the pharmacists voiced concerns that people are growing tired of hearing about the politics of vaccines and confused by the dizzying array of policy changes.
“We have to untie health care from the politics,” Hamrick said.
“Less outbreaks, less severe complications, less hospitalizations, less death,” Hamrick said. Vaccines “keep people in the population healthier in the long run.”

According to a memo produced by the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities, at least two county clerks have been contacted in recent weeks by Andrew McCoy “Mac” Warner, a DOJ official. While serving as attorney general of West Virginia, Warner falsely claimed the CIA and FBI colluded with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to steal the 2020 presidential election from Trump. 
The memo was shared with election officials across the state and obtained by The Independent through a public records request.

Warner requested Jasper County Clerk Charlie Davis and McDonald County Clerk Jessica Cole allow the DOJ to “access, physically inspect and perhaps take physical custody” of election equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems that was used in the November 2020 election, according to the memo. 
In an interview with The Independent, Davis said he informed the DOJ his office purchased new equipment and no longer has the machines used in the 2020 election. But even if he had those machines, Davis said it would be illegal for him to allow anyone access to them. 
“Absolutely not,” he said. “The laws prohibit us from allowing anybody to touch our equipment.”
Davis said he’s not sure why the DOJ wants to access machines used in the 2020 election, which Trump won in Missouri with 57% of the vote. But after the call from the DOJ, Davis said he was also contacted by former Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft urging him to comply with the DOJ request. 
In a statement included in the memo, Cole said custody, maintenance, preparation, testing and storage of election equipment are the responsibility of the local election authority. Allowing unauthorized access, she said, is a crime. 
“These safeguards exist to protect the security, accuracy and integrity of our elections,” she said. 
Livingston County Clerk Sherry Parks, who serves as president of the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities, echoed Cole’s point in an email to The Independent, noting that while “robust pre- and post-election equipment testing is open to the public for observation, it is illegal to allow unauthorized access or tampering to election equipment.”
The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. 
Ashcroft, who in July was appointed by the governor to serve as an administrative law judge, said in a brief interview on Tuesday: “If I were involved, it was a request from someone to help connect people together. And it would have been something that I’d done on my own time, not during work hours. And it would have just been, ‘Hey, do you know someone? Can you give me their number?’ That sort of thing.”
A spokeswoman for Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said in an email to The Independent that Hoskins was contacted by the DOJ hoping to speak with local election officials “for more information and context. Our office referred them to the clerks directly.”
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

In recent months, the DOJ has been contacting states demanding access to sensitive election and voting data. The department has sent letters to at least nine states asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, according to Stateline. 
The focus on Dominion machines harkens back to the web of baseless conspiracy theories spread by Trump supporters in the years following his 2020 defeat that the company was at the heart of a scheme designed to rig the presidential election. 
Those lies about a stolen election helped fuel the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continue to percolate through Trump’s political base even after he won a second term last year. 
Dominion won a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News in 2023 after the network repeatedly promoted lies that the company’s machines had been used to flip votes away from Trump in an effort to help Biden win the White House.
More recently, right-wing cable channel Newsmax agreed in August to pay Dominion $67 million to settle a libel lawsuit based on similar false claims of election rigging. 
Davis, who still uses Dominion machines, said he knows there are some people who question the integrity of the 2020 election. 
“But it’s been proven, especially here in Jasper County and in the State of Missouri, that our election results are the results of the elections,” he said. “It’s proven that the machines count the ballots correctly.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/080624_Vote1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

A new report estimates about 40,000 adults in Greater Boston could face stricter work rules that now extend to age 65 and narrow exemptions for parents.
The post SNAP changes will affect an estimated 40,000 in Greater Boston appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A NEW FEDERAL LAW could leave 7 percent of Boston-area SNAP recipients with reduced food assistance or new hurdles to qualify, according to a report released Tuesday.
The One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump in July overhauls the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program with stricter work rules, new immigrant eligibility limits and higher state cost-sharing requirements.
An analysis by Boston Indicators estimates about 40,000 adults in Greater Boston could face stricter work rules that now extend to age 65 and narrow exemptions for parents. As of July 2025, nearly 579,000 Greater Boston residents received SNAP, with the highest participation in cities such as Lawrence and Brockton.
Previously, adults ages 18 to 55 without a disability or young children had to work or attend job training 20 hours a week to qualify. Now, parents of children under 14 are exempt, down from under 18, and exemptions for veterans and people experiencing homelessness have been eliminated.
The report said the changes will affect recipients who are “technically able-bodied but face barriers to stable employment, such as inconsistent work hours, caregiving obligations, or limited access to training programs.”
Of those facing new requirements, about 31,000 live in childless households and another 11,000 in families with teenagers.
The impact is expected to fall more heavily on white residents, who make up the largest share of older SNAP clients. Roughly 18,000 white adults could be affected by the new age rules. Latino households may also be disproportionately hit, with about 5,000 adults projected to lose eligibility under the narrowed parenting exemption.
The federal law also eliminates eligibility for about 9,600 legally present immigrants with humanitarian status in the Boston area, including refugees and trafficking victims, according to the report.
The changes at the federal level mean state lawmakers have to decide whether to come up with a new plan to help SNAP recipients or let them cope on their own with the new federal rules.

School leaders kept it quiet.,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/09/02/a-kansas-student-reported-her-coach-for-harassment-and-touching-school-leaders-kept-it-quiet/,A student's allegation of sexual harassment against a Kansas superintendent raises alarms about safety of children and risk of districts awash in secrecy.,"Comanche County School District Superintendent Ty Theurer, photographed with the 2019 graduating class at South Central High School in Coldwater, is under investigation for alleged sexual harassment of a student. He was serving as golf coach this spring, according to the student's complaint, when he told her to hold golf clubs as if she was grasping a penis. (Comanche County School District)COLDWATER — After the father of a small-town, southwest Kansas high school junior reported his daughter was the victim of sexual harassment and unwanted touching by her golf coach, he met with the coach and principal to lay out the teenager’s concerns and disgust.
By the end of that meeting in May, the father said, the three men seemed to have an understanding that the coach violated policy — if not the law — when he made a stunning comment to the girl during golf practice: He told her to grip a club like it was a penis.
At the meeting, the coach and principal signed a document affirming he directed lurid comments at the girl, according to a copy of the document obtained by Kansas Reflector. The student confirmed the accusations in a report with law enforcement and in an interview with Kansas Reflector.
The document said the coach on multiple occasions grabbed the student’s hips, waist and shoulders while standing behind her. She also said that he held the back of her thigh, purportedly to improve her golf posture.
Ty Theurer eventually resigned as the South Central High School golf coach, which was his part-time assignment in the Comanche County School District. He didn’t surrender a much more influential position in the district: Superintendent.
Kansas Reflector interviews with students, parents, educators and elected officials tied to Comanche County schools revealed a concerted effort by insiders to shield the district’s top administrator, despite ongoing law enforcement and Title IX investigations. People with knowledge of Theurer’s past said the golf practice incident wasn’t the only example of inappropriate behavior by the superintendent, who for years personally controlled how the district responded to alleged sexual harassment.
Kansas Reflector reporting shows the Comanche County school board president and vice president along with the high school principal collaborated to minimize disciplinary action against Theurer. It indicated the president sought to tamp down scrutiny of the superintendent as word of the student’s allegation made its way through the sparsely populated district.
In a brief interview with Kansas Reflector, Theurer declined to respond to questions about the complaint.
“I’m not going to answer any of those questions,” he said. “I am under investigation. I’m not allowed to speak about it.”

‘A little bold’
The student who Theurer made the salacious comments to said she had been standing near him at a the Coldwater golf course during practice this spring, according to a Comanche County Sheriff’s Office report and an interview with Kansas Reflector. The student said Theurer approached her and said, “OK, now I’m going to be a little bold.”
She said he moved closer to her and whispered details of how he expected her to hold golf clubs. She quoted him: “I want you to imagine you have a penis.”
When the student responded with alarm to Theurer’s remark, she said, the superintendent cupped his hands around his groin, saying, “Just like this.”
Her description for law enforcement and Kansas Reflector also said the superintendent “ran his hand against the back of my neck and slowly moved me forward to help me with my putting position.” The summary said Theurer grabbed the back of her thigh as he urged her to bend her knees.
The student’s parents requested anonymity in this story to protect the privacy of their teenage daughter. Kansas Reflector and its parent organization, States Newsroom, do not identify survivors of sexual abuse.
In May, the student’s father reported the behavior to Andy Uhl, the Comanche County school board’s vice president. Uhl apparently passed the dad’s complaint up the chain of command. That resulted in the father’s meeting with Theurer and South Central High School principal Bud Valerius.
But instead of all seven members of the school board assuming a role in a personnel issue involving the person hired by the board to serve as superintendent, Valerius dealt with the student’s complaint as if it were a clash between coach and athlete, emails show. Valerius took that approach despite conflicts of interest, including his job as a direct subordinate of Theurer, his assignment as assistant golf coach and his friendship with Theurer.
School board president Kelly Herd said in an email to other board members that in her opinion, “There was nothing in the complaint that would warrant administrative leave” for superintendent Theurer. Instead, she told board members, coach Theurer had been given a “warning” to not offend again.
The school board replaced the superintendent as the district’s Title IX coordinator with oversight of sexual harassment or sex discrimination complaints because it would be improper for Theurer to investigate himself. Those duties were passed several months ago to the district’s elementary school principal, who would be expected initiate an investigation of the superintendent.

‘Nothing has been handled right’
Dean Yoder is another member of the Comanche County school board, which governs the education of the 300 students near the Oklahoma boarder. Besides Coldwater, the district draws students from communities including Protection, Wilmore and Buttermilk. The district extends into Kiowa and Clark counties.
A majority of the school board was excluded at the outset from the process of dealing with the leadership crisis, Yoder said.
The school board president ordered him to “stand down,” Yoder said, and she argued the controversy involving Theurer had to be resolved quietly.
“Nothing has been handled right,” Yoder said.
Bill Faflick, executive director of the Kansas State High School Activities Association, said he wasn’t aware of the controversy in Comanche County schools before being contacted by Kansas Reflector.
He said the student who made the complaint should know she could have done nothing to warrant harassment by a school administrator. Assuming the complaint was proven, he said, the incident would make “every dad shudder.”
“If true, certainly that’s inappropriate. It’s wrong as wrong can be. There’s no place for that in school sports,” said Faflick, who worked for 30 years in administrative roles in Wichita public schools.
Herd, the school board president, appeared to shield information about the case from the full school board. In a video obtained by Kansas Reflector, Herd abruptly adjourned a June board meeting to circumvent discussion of Theurer’s conduct. She ordered her colleagues to stop speaking with community members about the controversy.
Herd resisted pleas, including from the golf athlete’s parents, to convene a special meeting so the board could learn more about the allegations and investigatory process, and weigh potential disciplinary options.
Since May, the board president sent a series of emails about the Theurer controversy to fellow board members. In that correspondence, Herd said she and the board’s vice president, in conjunction with high school principal, dealt effectively with the sexual harassment complaint. Herd said “normal procedure” was followed.
Herd, who didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector requests for comment, said in an email to the board that the complaint ought to be viewed as a teachable moment for a coach rather than a leadership disaster centered on a district superintendent.
“As with any other HS coach, Bud (Valerius, high school principal) is the one to handle these issues. All coaches are given a warning and this will be considered (Theurer’s),” Herd’s email to board members said. “Bud called me and Andy (Uhl) to update us. We both agreed it has been addressed and handled. I assure you this was not taken lightly and it was not brushed aside.”
In another email, the board president instructed her elected peers to cooperate with her goal of limiting public knowledge of Theurer’s plight.
“This conversation regarding Ty has gotten far out of control in our community. We as board members must be careful to not continue to fuel the fire,” Herd wrote. “He has been written up and it is in his personnel file. He did not deny nor make excuses.”
 
Ongoing investigations
The student’s parents, frustrated school board leadership hadn’t moved to guarantee student safety, filed a report with local law enforcement. Comanche County authorities referred the case of alleged battery to the Ford County Sheriff’s Office.
The school board’s president and the student’s parents said the sexual harassment complaint presented to the school district was forwarded to the Kansas Association of School Boards, which advises school boards on compliance with federal Title IX law. A representative of KASB has interviewed students and others associated within the school district regarding Theurer.
School board members expect to be briefed in executive session on the report, the school board president said.
Eventually, the school board association’s draft report must be shared with the superintendent and complainant. A “decision-maker,” potentially an independent hearing officer, would examine evidence and make a determination about whether harassment occurred. Both sides could appeal.
In a recent email to board members, Herd recommended board members fend off any reporter asking questions about Theurer by explaining they were unable to comment.
“I am not keeping secrets. Nor am I acting on my own,” the school board president said.

‘Creeps me out’
South Central High School graduate Isabel Hackney said in an interview with Kansas Reflector that Theurer’s objectionable pronouncements to students extended beyond the golf course.
Hackney said she accidentally collided with a male friend at the school in October 2024, and it was caught on security video. She and some other students decided to watch the footage in the high school’s administration office.
While they were watching, she said, the superintendent emerged from his office. Theurer asked to repeatedly watch the clip, Hackney said.
“Then he said, ‘Izzy, you just got teabagged,’ ” Hackney said, repeating slang for putting a scrotum near a face. “From then on, I felt honestly scared to be around Mr. Theurer.”
Emily Hackney, Isabel’s mother, subsequently confronted Theurer outside the high school about his remark. She told the superintendent it was wrong to speak to her daughter that way.
“He was trying to ignore me,” Emily Hackney said. “He tried to deny it.”
Klete Hackney, Isabel’s father, said his daughter feared retaliation if the family complained to anyone involved with the school district. Instead, Isabel refused to shake the superintendent’s hand at graduation this spring.
“She did it for herself and she did it for all the kids,” Klete Hackney said.
 
Upcoming board meeting
An attempt could be made during the school board’s meeting Wednesday evening at South Central High School to compel a vote by the seven-member board on a motion to place Theurer on administrative leave.
“If you don’t know anything about it, it’s because that’s the plan — sweep it under the rug and nobody will ever know,” said Zach Ellis, who has two children at the high school.
Ellis said he signed up to speak at the next school board meeting, but he’s not certain the board would allow him to say what he wanted to say. On social media, Ellis encouraged people with ties to the school district to join him at the meeting.
He said the school board by now should have adopted new policies or procedures designed to deter sexual harassment. It was “absolutely ridiculous” the school board allowed a superintendent under investigation for sexual harassment and battery to run the district, he said.
“I’ve got a daughter who is a junior. I’m all about making sure that her safety is protected,” Ellis said. “She avoids him. Her words not mine: ‘He creeps me out, so I avoid him.’ ”
 
‘Admit his guilt’
The student’s father said the principal read aloud the one-page document during their meeting in May. Theurer and Valerius agreed the signing confirmed they discussed the memo. The superintendent didn’t challenge the student’s recollections at the time, the father said.
“I said, ‘I’m not leaving this office without some documentation that this conversation happened,'” the father said. “That’s when the principal said, ‘Hey, we can all sign it here. He can sign it to admit his guilt.’ ”
In an interview, the student said that when she joined the high school’s golf team, other girls warned her to “be careful, Ty’s a little weird.”
“My first day we were in a line,” she said. “He came up behind me and placed his hands on my hips. I wasn’t asked if that was OK. Whenever I asked the golf girls … ‘Hey, does he do this a lot?’ And they’re, like, ‘Yeah, you’ll get used to it.’ ”
She quit the team after the superintendent made the penis remark.
 
‘How could this not be a priority?’
In June, the student’s parents attended a regularly scheduled Comanche County school board meeting with the goal of sharing information about what their daughter said she endured while coached by Theurer.
Herd, the board president, called the mother before the meeting in an attempt to dissuade her from making public comments about the superintendent, the mother said.
The mother decided to go to the board meeting. She attempted to read from a written statement. Herd cut her off by adjourning the meeting. A video obtained by Kansas Reflector showed Herd and other board members walking out of the room with the mother still reading from her prepared remarks.
“How could this not be a priority? Not for my family alone, but for the school community?” the mother said in an interview. “The sudden adjournment and insistence that such an issue of import was literally worth walking out on is deeply troubling.”
She said the school board president’s attempt to bury the complaint was “completely unacceptable” and risked the health and safety of students in the district’s three schools.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Family Planning)Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider is continuing its fight in federal court to reinstate lost Medicaid funding.
Maine Family Planning, which serves more than 8,000 patients, half of whom are on Medicaid, lost up to $1.9 million in federal reimbursements after the federal budget reconciliation bill was signed into law on July 4. 
Certain reproductive health care providers — including Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood clinics in Maine — were blocked by a provision in the law from accepting Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood challenged the provision in federal court and succeeded in temporarily blocking it from applying to the organization. In late August, Maine Family Planning made a similar case, appealing to Judge Lance Walker, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term. Walker rejected Maine Family Planning’s request for a preliminary injunction on August 25.
The health care provider did not demonstrate the irreparable harm it claimed to face, Walker wrote in his decision. He also acknowledged that after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Maine Family Planning and other providers knew about the increased risk that they could lose federal funding if they continued to provide abortions and that the provider still “stood firm in its mission.” 
On Friday, Maine Family Planning, represented by national legal advocacy firm the Center for Reproductive Rights, appealed Walker’s decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, asking for a decision by Sept. 8.
If the appeals court does not grant the injunction “within a matter of weeks, MFP will have to discharge all of its existing primary care patients and wind down its primary care practice,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh wrote in the latest filing.
“Soon after, MFP may have to discharge family planning patients on Medicaid as well.”
Maine Family Planning’s services include primary care, STI testing, and cancer screenings. While the provider offers abortions, it does not use Medicaid funds, as the Hyde Amendment already bans use of federal reimbursements to fund abortions. However, Mehdizadeh made the case that the organization is collateral damage in the federal government’s attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.
 “If Congress’s goal was to generally reduce the number of abortions … it is irrational to achieve that goal by imposing exacting criteria that only apply to a tiny subset of abortion providers nationwide, treating them differently from all other ‘similarly situated’ providers,” she wrote.
Granting the injunction would not harm the defendants, she argued, but would cause lasting damage for patients and Maine Family Planning’s reputation — “damage that cannot be easily undone even if Medicaid funding is eventually restored.”

(Photo: Colleen Pegar / Hill County Extension).Palmer amaranth, a weed agricultural interests are desperately trying to prevent becoming established in Montana, was found last month near a grain silo in Hill County.
Agricultural groups, including those working at Montana State University Extension, have been closely tracking the weed, which is notably resistant to herbicides. There have been four reported confirmed instances of Palmer amaranth in Montana, though researchers say there isn’t a known established distribution in the state. The site is being monitored by the MSU Extension office.
The weed, while native to North America, doesn’t have a foothold in Montana. It spreads quickly and can choke out crops — it can decrease crop yields by 80 to 90% if left unchecked, according to a report in the New York Times. If it becomes established, the potential economic impact could be severe, according to MSU Extension’s agricultural department.
Herbicide resistant weeds are a “huge” issue in Montana, said Tim Seipel, a Cropland Weed Specialist with MSU Extension. Palmer amaranth is a pigweed with long, thin flower heads when compared to its more common relatives, such as redroot pigweed.
“If it really spreads out in crop fields in Montana, especially in our pulse crop industry and pulse fields — so lentils, chickpeas, beets — it would cost us millions of dollars, probably in additional herbicide input costs,” Seipel said. “So that’s why we’re trying to really be on top of it and keep it contained.”
One peer-reviewed study published in Frontiers in Plant Science found Palmer amaranth resistant to six different herbicide brands. The plant has found ways to adapt to human-created herbicides and is essentially outpacing science. It’s hard to kill — plants pulled out of the ground have been known to reestablish themselves and the plant itself can grow three inches in a day.

“When you have a species like Palmer Amaranth that has evolved resistance to many of our known herbicide modes of action, the way the herbicide kills the plant, what it does to the plant, you begin to have to stack modes of action on top of each other,” Seipel said. “You have to choose modes of action that may be still under patent. There’s no generic, you’re buying more complex tank mixes.”
What this means for farmers, Seipel said, is higher costs for weed control and lower prices for their products. Crops harvested in fields containing many green weeds also are stained by them, which means lower prices when farmers sell.
“You take it to the elevator and you sell it, you get docked economically for stained lentils,” Seipel said. “So you don’t get paid.”
Precipitation this summer, described as “abundant” in a press release discussing the weed, could be to blame for the plant taking root. Sepiel said the Palmer amaranth was found in a field following harvesting from what’s called a “custom cutter” or a company that follows ripening wheat through multiple states, harvesting it for producers.
Palmer amaranth is native to the American southwest and began seriously competing with cotton in the 1990s. It’s since moved to the Midwest and Mid-south.
The weed is not the only troublesome one in Montana. The MSU Extension Office also lists Kochia scoparia, a broadleaf weed, as a major threat to Montana as well because of how difficult to control it is.
These weeds can move via harvesters, trains – even birdseed, Seipel said. Recently, Palmer amaranth was found in Spokane County (Washington). It was tracked back to contaminated birdseed bought at a Safeway.
The first recorded palmer amaranth sighting in Montana? Also traced back to bird feed.
“Bird feed, kind of dirty stuff,” Spiel noted. “Has lots of weeds in it.”
The Extension office asked anyone who sees Palmer amaranth to contact them immediately. Much like invasive species work, quick responses can tamp down an issue before it spreads.
“Everyone’s heads are up and they’re looking for it. We found three plants so far, and none of them have made seed in the field so far,” Seipel said. “We’ve gotten them out early enough because they’re not quite adapted to Montana’s conditions yet. So the more we do that, the more we can keep it under wraps.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Palmer2.jpg,,,2025-09-02 15:57:57.920619

In a news release, Gov. Jeff Landry’s office said the facility “will house the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.”
Landry declared a state emergency in late July to allow the expedited repair of Camp J at Angola. The section, which has been closed since 2018, consists of four maximum-security buildings on the 18,000-acre prison grounds. At its peak, the camp held more than 400 prisoners. The state has not said what its capacity would be after renovations. 
Once known as the “Dungeon,” most of Camp J had been designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons. Corrections officials closed it seven years ago after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 prison employees quit, retired or were fired related to misconduct at Camp J.
Other than being a quarantine zone for prisoners during the COVID-19 pandemic, Camp J has not been in use. 
Landry’s emergency order suspended state procurement code and public bid law for the state to secure any materials and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency. The cost of Camp J’s refurbishment has not yet been made public. 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Deputy ICE Director Madison Sheahan will join the governor at Angola Wednesday morning to make the announcement official. 
Aside from its state penitentiary, Louisiana has become a go-to location for the Trump administration since it placed a heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement in January. The state’s nine ICE processing and detentions centers have a combined capacity of 6,000 people, second only to Texas with more than 28,000.
Louisiana State Penitentiary has room to hold more than 6,000 incarcerated people. Its population was 4,253 as of June 30, according to the most recent statistics from the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety. 
Immigrant rights advocates say the Louisiana ICE facilities have been full for several months because Bondi and the U.S. Department of Justice consider federal courts in the South to be more friendly venues for its immigration cases. 
According to data analysis from the Deportation Data Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 1,989 people in Louisiana from when Trump returned to office Jan. 20 through June 26. More than half of those arrestees have since been deported or removed from the United States.
The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.        
Critics of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration have called on federal courts to uphold the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of due process for persons who are arrested. They note the vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been allowed to post bail while awaiting trial and are therefore unable to build their defense and secure witnesses. 
This is a developing story.

Ned Lamont named Susan Hamilton, general counsel and a former commissioner of the state Department of Children and Families, as the agency’s interim commissioner on Tuesday.
Her predecessor, Jodi Hill-Lilly, left the department Monday after less than two years as its leader.
Hamilton served as commissioner of DCF from 2007 to 2011 under Gov. M. Jodi Rell. During that time, the agency saw some slippage in progress toward meeting children’s basic service needs, according to reports. 
Lamont cited Hamilton’s long career at DCF, first as a social worker and later as commissioner, as preparation to return to the role. The agency is charged with the care of thousands of children in foster care and oversees programming to support kids’ mental health needs.
“She returned two years ago to serve as general counsel, and her extensive experience makes her ready to immediately step back into the role as commissioner for a second stint,” Lamont’s statement said. “The services DCF provides — safeguarding some of the most vulnerable youths in our state — are among the most important in government, and it is a function whose work never stops.”
Hamilton, who will be the third person to serve as the head of DCF during the Lamont administration, thanked the governor for selecting her for the position.
“I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to serve again as the DCF commissioner to help lead an incredible and dedicated team who work tirelessly to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of Connecticut’s children and families,” Hamilton said in a statement. 
The Center for Children’s Advocacy released a statement in support of Hamilton, saying that its attorneys have long worked cooperatively during her years of work in the state. 
“We appreciate her willingness to serve as interim DCF Commissioner during these challenging times,” the organization said in its statement. “Connecticut’s child welfare system continues to confront urgent challenges, including the most serious behavioral health crisis and human service gaps the state has dealt with in many years. We know Sue will continue her longstanding partnership with child welfare stakeholders to strategically address these challenges in the days and weeks ahead.”
Hamilton’s initial tenure as DCF commissioner took place while the agency was under the supervision of a court monitor.
The court monitor was assigned as part of a 1989 federal civil rights lawsuit on behalf of “Juan F.,” an anonymous 10-year-old boy representative of a class of children whose needs were unmet by an agency run with poor resources, guided by outdated policies.
The court monitor issued regular reports on the agency’s progress toward reform until DCF was released from the order in 2022.
A 2009 report from the monitor found that nearly half of the children in DCF care weren’t having their basic service needs met, and that the state was losing ground in its court-assigned reforms. The agency saw a drop in the percentage of children who were reunified with their parents from about 72% of cases studies to 56%, according to Children’s Rights, Inc. The group noted that DCF was meeting 15 of the 22 indicators for success, after previously meeting 17 of 22, marking “the state’s worst performance since Susan Hamilton was appointed commissioner of DCF in June 2007.”
Ken Mysogland, bureau chief of external affairs, said during the more than 30 years of the consent decree, it was common for there to be progress and slippage on the goals under various commissioners.
“Throughout every commissioner’s tenure, compliance with the outcome measures may have increased or may have decreased in particular measures due to many factors. Those include budgetary considerations, political implications, the impact of particular societal pressures on families and the emerging nature of risks that our families face,” Mysogland said. ” … At the end of her tenure, the department was in substantial compliance and sustained compliance with all but two of the outcomes.”
In 2009, Hamilton was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence. She participated in a diversionary program that erased the charge from her record.
Committee on Children co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, said he looks forward to working with Hamilton and hopes to support her in “stabilizing the agency” and supporting kids and families.
Paris said because DCF deals with sensitive issues, it’s often open to criticism and that the blame for the agency’s challenges can’t be put on any one person.
“I think the agency has always been under challenges, and I think it’s just by nature of the agency that we’re talking about and what we’re dealing with,” he said.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, the Committee on Children’s other co-chair, said she welcomes Hamilton to the role. “As we look forward to the future of DCF my hope is that children’s welfare will also include a commitment to behavioral health support for all our children to best serve them now and in the future,” Maher wrote to the Connecticut Mirror. “I look forward to working with Commissioner Hamilton in the months ahead.”
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly also issued a statement in support of Hamilton.
“With Susan Hamilton stepping in as interim commissioner, my hope is DCF enters this transition maintaining some stability,” Dauphinais’ statement said. “Her experience and appreciation for the department will hopefully improve services while Governor Lamont decides on a permanent successor to focus on what matters most—Connecticut’s children and families.”
Hamilton earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and justice studies from the University of New Hampshire, a Master of Social Work degree from the University of Connecticut School of Social Work, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law, according to Lamont’s office.
Hill-Lilly, the previous commissioner, earned about $250,000 annually, and Hamilton currently earns about $211,000, according to state records.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0812_SR_DCFMeeting_003-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 15:57:57.920619

In Connecticut, the money was used to fund infrastructure upgrades, schools, nonprofits and more.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “How easy COVID money whet CT lawmakers’ appetites for more,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark. There’s an ongoing investigation into alleged misappropriation of state grants to nonprofits in Hartford, and that’s what prompted you to do this deep dive into lawmaker earmarks in Hartford. So let’s start with the FBI investigation into Hartford State Senator Doug McCrory’s role in steering the COVID relief money to the nonprofits there.
MP: Yes. So what we know about it really stems from the release and response to Freedom of Information requests from the Connecticut Mirror and others that disclose documents that were subpoenaed from the state government. So those subpoenas were public information. The Lamont Administration released them, and the focus there is on Senator McCrory’s relationship with a woman who runs a nonprofit and also consults for other nonprofits. They appear to be looking at whether or not there was any undue influence. But again, we have to be careful here, because we know what records they’re looking at, but we don’t have any precise allegations of wrongdoing; they are looking at the Senator’s relationship with any number of nonprofits in Hartford, the district he serves, which is North Hartford, Windsor and Bloomfield.
WSHU: Now, let’s talk about the role of lawmakers in actually getting these projects funded through earmarks. What is an earmark, and how does that work?
MP: Earmark, you know, it’s known by other terms. You know, people would call it pork barrel spending. This is really something that is as old as politics, the idea of a legislator, whether it’s in the Connecticut General Assembly or in Congress, of directing funding towards something in their district. This fell out of favor in Congress — in 2011, they actually banned earmarks, and then they recently brought them back with some significant reforms, and those are reforms that we don’t see in Connecticut. They are, namely, a member of Congress who is trying to direct federal funding to a particular recipient, which is disclosed. They have to own it. And that is very different from how it works in the Connecticut General Assembly. It’s a very fuzzy process. It really relies on a lawmaker’s good relationship with the House’s leadership and the Democratic majority leaders.
WSHU: The Democratic leaders are in charge of a lot of this money now, but in the past, we’ve had a divided government in Connecticut, and we still had this issue of earmarks.
MP: Yes, earmarks are not unique to the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party was my focus because they control the governor’s office in both chambers of the General Assembly, and that’s where the money is going to the districts of Democratic lawmakers by and large. Now we should say many of the recipients are well-established nonprofits, as well as some municipal governments, so there is nothing scandalous on its face about this money going to those recipients. But the question is, there’s very little oversight. The whole process is opaque on the surface; we don’t know who the lawmaker is who actually directed this money.
WSHU: In the federal legislation, lawmakers must list all the specific earmarks.
MP: Correct. That is correct, and that is a major difference between how it’s done in Washington and how it’s done in Hartford. Because of the FBI investigation, I think you’re going to see a debate next year about how earmarks should be done. You know, the other element here is, after the Great Recession of 2008, the General Assembly really did not have a lot of money to spread around in this way. So this, this kind of stuff, dried up. And then with COVID and the American Rescue Plan Act, ARPA, there was a lot of money flowing in here, and all of a sudden, they had money to dispose of. It was discretion. A lot of it was discretionary money, and there was a hard deadline.
WSHU: So they had to spend it immediately or lose it, right?
MP: Absolutely. And it’s quite clear that, you know, appetites were whetted by the ARPA money that came in. And so we saw a difference in the last two state budgets. There was a lot of vetting in the Department of Economic and Community Development, which runs some very competitive grant programs. There was also a quote, various grant line items in the budget, and it doubled from the last biennial budget to this one.
WSHU: So, how much is in it now?
MP: Over the two-year budget, it’s now about $39 million. So that’s over two years, and that is slightly more than double what it was in the previous two-year budget. So Cathy Austin, the state Senator who is the co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said, look, there’s no question what was going on here. The ARPA money puts people in a frame of mind to keep doing local earmarks, and that’s why this is sort of blowing up. So, there’s a bunch of things happening here at once, which is why I thought it was a good idea to take a look at how earmarks work in Connecticut.
WSHU: Okay, so, how is it working? You spoke with Matt Ritter, the speaker.
MP: Who was very, very honest about the dynamics. I mean, he said what we know, but people rarely say, which is, yeah, from time to time, you know, you help a member of your caucus who has some trouble back home, perhaps with a tough race, so you help that person bring home some money. In the old days, we hadn’t seen this in a long time, but when there were real fights for the speakership and other leadership posts, earmarks would be spread around that way to, you know, get people to support your candidacy for speaker; that is not the case here.
WSHU: Politics does play a role in determining.
MP: Yes, it does. So what are the relationships with your leadership? But again, there’s not a lot of transparency there. The other thing that I wrote about it, which is kind of interesting, is that the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus has its own pool of money, and each member of that caucus gets to earmark $150,000 to an organization in their district. And this is a deal that was cut after the Sandy Hook shooting. This was sort of a side agreement, because there was such a focus, understandably, on the murders of those 20 children and six educators. But you know, you had urban lawmakers who pointed out that the body count, quite frankly, in some of their cities was higher, but without making news, it would be one here, one there. What came out of that were two grant programs addressing youth services and youth violence protection, and it is really up to the Black and Puerto Rican caucus to distribute that money.
WSHU: But the money does go to a youth program run by the University of New Haven.
MP: Well, the evaluation was done by the Tow Institute in concert with the University of New Haven. So, the people are active in the Black and Puerto Rican caucus, particularly Toni Walker, who is the co-chair of the other appropriations. She points out that their earmarks, their programs come with some training from the Tow Institute and University of New Haven and some evaluations, because they’re really not detailed evaluations of the efficacy of these various groups. You might have to submit an annual report that shows activities, but there is no measure of how effective they are. The Black and Puerto Rican caucus actually has contracted again with this Institute and the University of New Haven to really try to do that feedback to see what works. What are the good metrics that would measure the efficacy of these programs?
WSHU: What are the Republicans saying about all this?
MP: Well, Tammy Nuccio is the ranking Republican on appropriations. You know, she just said, Look, this is asinine that there, particularly, I’m talking about the various grant line items in the Department of Economic and Community Development, where there are no standards. And she just says, This is crazy. There is no vetting. And Vinny Candelora, the House Minority Leader, makes a similar comment. And really, it’s hard to push back at that, because at least in the case of the various grant line items, there are not a lot of standards. One of the senior officials at the ECD, that department, makes it clear that this program comes without any parameters as to who can get the money. The legislature says, give them the money. They cut a contract, and at the end of the year, they make sure it was spent, and they get a kind of minimalist report as to what they did with it.
WSHU: Wow. This is an issue that is very likely to come up in the next session, right?
MP: Matt Ritter, the speaker, certainly thinks so. There’s nothing like a federal criminal investigation. What are the standards for how money’s going out the door? And again, I want to be careful and not sort of, you know, smear all the recipients, because, again, many of these are well-established nonprofits, but some are new, and some of them, you don’t really have a lot of detail about what you’re getting for the money. It’s really spreading money around. And, you know, there are things like Little Leagues that get the money, which I think everybody likes the Little League. But the question is, is that really the best use of state funds? It’s a real broad mix of what the money is used for.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

(Photo by Bear Gulch Fire 2025 via Facebook)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

Congressional committee to discuss Great American Outdoors Act, which provided money to preserve the Kelly Parcel. That revenue stream may be in danger.
The post Hageman to hear testimony on public land funding in Teton Park appeared first on WyoFile .","A Congressional panel will hear testimony in Grand Teton National Park on Friday about the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act amid worries Republicans might cut a line of funding to expand public parkland. 
Congress and the Trump administration have already fired public land agency staff and sought to sell Western public land for development while at the same time boosting logging, drilling, mining and new road-building.
U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman is scheduled to attend the field hearing of the Committee on Natural Resources at Jenny Lake. 
Signed into law by President Trump in August 2020, the GAOA provides two distinct funding channels. One is dedicated to maintenance backlogs and the other is earmarked to create new parkland, including everything from small-town ball diamonds to places like the sensitive Kelly Parcel. The funds benefit public land agencies in the Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture.

The act provides up to $1.9 billion a year for deferred maintenance. The act also permanently provides $900 million annually to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the account that enabled the government to buy the Kelly Parcel wildlife migration crossroad in Grand Teton.
Public land advocates worry the act’s conservation fund is in jeopardy.
“The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a question,” said Rob Wallace, a former high-ranking official with the U.S. Department of the Interior. As an independent citizen, he played a key role in the preservation of the square-mile Kelly Parcel last year.
“The administration says they support the deferred-maintenance piece,” he said. “That’s at least halfway there. I think there’s a very good chance the act will be reauthorized, at least for the deferred maintenance.”
Reauthorization and reform
The committee subtitled the hearing “Modernizing and Maintaining National Parks to Celebrate America’s 250th Birthday.”
“The hearing will examine opportunities to reauthorize and reform the Great American Outdoors Act to enhance public access, improve infrastructure, and create new outdoor recreation opportunities at our national parks,” the committee’s notice reads. The notice does not mention the other agencies — U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs — that also benefit from the act. Nor does the notice refer to the conservation fund.
The hearing is scheduled to be live streamed and to include testimony from Leslie Mattson, president of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. That nonprofit raised $37.6 million to enable the Kelly Parcel conservation purchase, preventing potential development as luxury real estate. (Wyoming, which owned the school section, demanded $100 million, but federal law prohibited the federal government from paying more than the appraised value.)
Chip Jenkins, Grand Teton National Park superintendent, is also on the witness list, along with Julie Calder, Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board vice president. Taylor Phillips, Jackson Hole Ecotours founder, and Kristen Brengel, National Parks Conservation Association senior vice president, are also on the agenda.
Many Wyoming politicians have been tepid, if not hostile, toward conservation of federal public land. The American people own about 48% of Wyoming, mainly through the U.S. Forest Service, the BLM and the National Park Service.
Both Wyoming’s Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis voted against the GAOA in 2020.

Hageman signed on as a friend of Utah when that state petitioned the Supreme Court last year to take over, own and control 18.5 million acres of BLM land — property owned by all Americans — in the Beehive State. She likened federal ownership to a casus belli — a case for war.
“[T]he federal government’s actions would amount to an invasion and conquest of that land [in Utah] if … Utah were a separate sovereign nation,” she argued in the unsuccessful pleading before the high court.
Public land advocates will offer their take on the politics of public lands in the West at a forum in Jackson, the day before the field hearings. At 1 p.m. Thursday, a coalition of conservation groups will bring the Keep Parks Public road tour to the Teton County Library.
The public forum will be the sixth stop in five Western states since the road tour began in mid-August. The forum features Peggie DePasquale, a Bridger-Teton National Forest ranger fired during the Trump administration’s recent purge of federal employees. She now works with the Wyoming Wilderness Association.
Jenny Fitzgerald, executive director of the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance, and Lauren Bogard, a senior director at the Center for Western Priorities, will be among the speakers.

Joni Ernst announced Tuesday she is officially not running for another term in the U.S. Senate, leaving the seat open heading into the 2026 election cycle.
In a video address, Ernst said it was “no easy decision” to decide not to seek reelection for a third term as senator.
“It has been an honor to dedicate my life to the service of our great state and country, having been raised in a family who has given me so much love and support,” Ernst said. “Now, as our family ages and grows, it’s my time for me to give back to them. After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026.”
Ernst, who was first elected in 2014 and reelected in 2020, is the first female combat veteran elected to the U.S. Senate, having served in the U.S. Army Reserves and Iowa Army National Guard. Before her time in Congress, she had served in public office as a state senator and Montgomery County auditor.

The Republican said Iowans sent her to Washington “with a mission in mind — to make Washington squeal,” referencing her 2014 campaign ad and efforts in office to address federal government waste, fraud and abuse. Ernst said she was “proud to say we have delivered” on her “squeal” promises. She also highlighted her work in the U.S. Senate on anti-abortion measures, preventing violence against women and supporting farmers and veterans.
“As a proud Harley rider, you can rest assured, I’m not slowing down anytime soon,” Ernst said. “There is still so much to accomplish before the end of my term, and I’ll keep fighting every single day, as I always have, to make Iowans’ voices heard loud and clear in the halls of Congress.”
Reports were published Friday from multiple outlets saying that sources close to Ernst expected she would announce her plans for 2026 this week. Though Senate GOP leadership had reportedly encouraged Ernst to run for another term, the senator faced criticism from Republicans for expressing concerns about U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the nomination process. She also gained national attention for saying “well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall when responding to a person who said GOP-backed Medicaid cuts would cause people to die.
Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat in the 2026 election, responded that Ernst’s decision not to run was a signal that Republicans’ hold of Iowa’s congressional seats could be at risk. Currently, Iowa’s federal delegation is all Republican, but Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Districts have been brought up by political forecasters as pivotal battlegrounds for control of the U.S. House in the upcoming midterms.
The Cook Political Report rated the race for Iowa’s Senate seat as “likely Republican” — but the race could be more contentious without an incumbent Republican candidate.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Kirsten Gillibrand released a statement responding to Ernst’s announcement, and said her decision shows that “Donald Trump and Senate Republicans’ devastating agenda has put their majority in jeopardy.”
“Republicans can see the writing on the wall: spiking costs and ripping away health care does so much damage to their states that they would rather leave the Senate than defend their actions to voters,” Schumer and Gillibrand said in the statement. “Democrats are in a strong position to win seats and continue fighting for working families.”
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage are currently running to become Iowa’s Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat in 2026.
National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said in a statement the Senate GOP campaign arm “is confident Iowans will elect a Republican to continue fighting for them and championing President Trump’s agenda in 2026.” He also thanked Ernst for her service in Washington and in the military.
“Joni Ernst has dedicated her life to serving our nation and improving the lives of Iowans,” Scott said. “Traveling across the Hawkeye State with Joni, I know she loves Iowa, and Iowa loves her. We are grateful for all she has accomplished in helping Iowa families keep more of their hard-earned money and make Washington squeal.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said Ernst “dropped out of this race because she knows her support for Medicaid cuts is a nonstarter” — and said whoever becomes the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate will have to contend with “the same toxic Republican agenda that’s harming Iowa families.”
“The energy is on our side heading into the midterms as Iowans are fed up with Washington Republicans spiking costs for working people to deliver tax cuts for billionaires,” Hart said. “In 2026, Iowans will elect a Democrat to the U.S. Senate who will prioritize making Iowa economically prosperous and a healthier state.”
 Hinson expected to make a bid for U.S. Senate
There are two Republicans currently running for the nomination: former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian candidate for the state Senate.
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District is also expected to join the race. In a social media post Monday, Hinson thanked Ernst for her service and added that she and her husband will share an announcement soon.
“As we look forward, President Trump needs a fighter in the Senate who will always have his back to continue to cut spending, deport illegal aliens, and put working families first,” Hinson wrote. “I’ve stood shoulder to shoulder with the President to pass this America First agenda in the House and I would be his strongest ally in the Senate. Matt and I will have an announcement soon about how we believe we can best serve Iowa, and how we can help President Trump make America great again.”
Hinson has been working on reelection efforts in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in recent months. There are currently three Democrats running for the seat in 2026, state Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque,  Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Hinson’s expected move to the U.S. Senate race in 2026 shows Democrats have a strong chance in the 2nd District race.
“Ashley Hinson is clearly eager to jump off the sinking ship that is her re-election in Iowa’s 2nd district,” Smith said. “Hinson is terrified to face her voters, who’ve had a front row seat as she’s prioritized Washington and billionaires while voting to raise Iowans’ costs. There’s change coming in Iowa: voters are ready for new leadership and no matter what Hinson decides, she will lose her seat.”

(Department of Defense Inspector General)President Donald Trump will announce his intention to move U.S. Space Command headquarters out of Colorado to Alabama on Tuesday, officials told national news outlets including The Associated Press. 
Space Command has been at full operational capacity at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs since December 2023, after former President Joe Biden announced in July that year it would stay in Colorado. 
Colorado officials previously expressed concern that Trump’s decision during his first presidential term to move Space Command to Huntsville, Alabama, was politically motivated, as he waited until after the 2020 election to announce the move. Alabama went for Trump, a Republican, in that election, and Colorado went for Biden, a Democrat.

Colorado officials from both parties have advocated Space Command staying in Colorado. Peterson housed a previous version of Space Command from 1985 to 2002. The Air Force subsequently oversaw military space operations from the site.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said in a statement Tuesday his office has been preparing for legal action over a Space Command relocation if Trump “made such an unlawful decision.” Weiser said military families in El Paso County have relied on the decision to keep Space Command headquarters in Colorado.  
“The Trump administration should not play political games with our nation’s military readiness and military families,” Weiser said in a statement. ”Moving Space Command Headquarters to Alabama is not only wrong for our national defense, but it’s harmful to hundreds of Space Command personnel and their families.”

(courtesy of Steele Hays)The Trump administration’s order to stop construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind project is putting hundreds of offshore workers out of a job — including dozens of local fishermen who voted for President Donald Trump and are asking him to reverse course.
A week ago, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all offshore work on the Revolution Wind farm so the federal government can​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona did not specify the nature of those security concerns.
Construction began on the 704-megawatt project in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated ​“wind energy area” that received sign-offs from multiple branches of the military, Canary Media reported Sunday.
Though often seen as opposed to offshore wind, many New England fishermen have made peace with the industry in recent years.
They increasingly rely on part-time salaries from wind companies as fishing revenues dry up. Over the past two years, Ørsted put 80 fishermen to work on the Revolution Wind project, paying out $9.5 million to captains, deckhands, and fishing boat owners, according to Gary Yerman, a Connecticut-based fisherman who founded and leads a fisher cooperative called Sea Services North America, which has an active contract to work on Revolution Wind.
“Most of us are Trump voters, and we still believe in a leader who builds. That’s why we’re asking President Trump to reverse the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind by Interior,” Yerman told Canary Media.
The stop-work order echoes a similar one the Interior Department gave in April that froze all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project — a move that grounded Sea Services’ fishermen for a month, until Trump lifted the ban.
Yerman and other commercial fishermen remained quiet the last time Trump’s assault on a wind farm put them out of work. This time they’re speaking out.
“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump. ​“This is not something any of us planned for: the captains, the crew, the shore engineers, the people we buy food from for our trips.”

Ørsted was one of the first firms building turbines in U.S. waters to employ local fishermen, offering Sea Services a contract in 2021 to perform safety and scout tasks. The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.
Today, it’s common for wind developers to rely on local U.S. fishermen. Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, codevelopers of the embattled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out about $8 million over the past two years directly to local fishermen and vessel owners.
“If the infrastructure and pilings are already in, what good is stopping now?” fisherman Tony Alvernaz told Canary Media when asked about the Revolution Wind pause. A Massachusetts fisherman unaffiliated with Sea Services, Alvernaz works part-time for Vineyard Wind, assisting with the ongoing construction of its 62 turbines. Of those, 17 are already sending power to the grid.
Alvernaz is concerned about the Trump administration’s pattern of halting wind projects without warning and with little justification. Trump has already pressed pause on two of the five offshore wind farms currently under construction in America today.
Trump putting fishermen out of work
In a statement Monday, an Ørsted spokesperson said Revolution Wind supports more than 2,500 jobs around the U.S., including ​“hundreds” of local offshore jobs.
Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman. Now, sitting at the docks due to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, the 15 fishermen who planned to be at sea, working 10-day shifts throughout this month, will get paid nothing.
“Our cooperative only invoices when our boats are on active duty. Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media. The group is calling on Trump to lift the ban so that its members can resume the job, which would have involved eight more fishermen helping with an offshore substation this fall.
The extra income from Revolution Wind has been a lifeline, particularly for scallop fishermen who, in recent years, have been severely restricted in how much they can fish.
Strict federal quotas have been put in place to allow scallop populations to rebuild after years of being overfished, according to Morris, but that has meant scallopers — who form the majority of Sea Services’ members — are off the water for about 10months a year.
Before the pause on Revolution Wind, scalloper Kevin Souza expected to make an additional $200,000 working on the project as a part-time boat captain for two years. Souza told Canary Media in February that, had he stuck to scalloping alone, he’d be ​“lucky” to earn $100,000 in a single year. The deckhands he hires only bring in around $30,000 per year working on scallop boats, but the offshore wind gig makes it possible for them to earn a ​“middle-class wage,” said Souza.
RI wind project was heading toward finish line. Now it’s about to veer into Boston federal court.

Souza has recruited both of his sons, his nephew, and other young people from longtime fishing families to work for the wind industry. They might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income, he said.
Losing faith in Trump
As a group, America’s commercial fishermen have long been loyal to Trump. Last week’s order is shaking that confidence.
“I can’t think of one guy who isn’t a Trumper in our co-op. We’re blue-collar guys (and some gals too) who get up before dawn, work with our hands, and we trusted him to look out for us. The truth is, we love President Trump,” Yerman said.
In New Bedford, Massachusetts, home to the country’s most profitable fishing port, ​“TRUMP 2024” flags fly from dozens of boats docked in the harbor. A few of those crews work for the offshore wind companies, and at least one captain lowers his MAGAflag before setting out to the wind farms, according to Rodney Avila, a Sea Services fisherman.
That kind of faith makes Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind even more gutting. 
“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you. … Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is,” said Morris.
Trump’s attacks on wind have dried up job prospects for local fishermen up and down the East Coast. His administration’s hostile actions have thrown sand in the gears of a New Jersey wind farm that planned to start construction in the next three years, Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, and another wind project off the coast of Maine.
In addition to targeting individual projects, the Trump administration has initiated policies intended to undermine the entire sector: killing offshore wind leasing, pausing permitting for wind farms, and sunsetting tax credits critical to their economic viability.
Many fishermen, including those who have pocketed thousands by working at offshore wind farms, remain wary of the companies building turbines out at sea.
These fishermen made peace with offshore wind. Then Trump came along.

“No fisherman loves new structures in the water, but we all have grandkids,” Roy Campanale, a Sea Services member based in Rhode Island, told Canary Media. ​“We’ve lived with the water getting warmer, watched the fish move north, and had to adapt again and again.”
Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind imposes yet another hardship.
Alvernaz voted for Trump and opposes certain wind farms that he believes pose a risk to his favorite fishing grounds. He said that he does not support Revolution Wind due to its placement on Cox Ledge, a swath of seabed identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as critical habitat for Atlantic cod.
But if Trump decides to freeze Vineyard Wind, for example, Alvernaz said he ​“would not be happy.”
Alvernaz has worked on the water for over 40 years. Yerman’s fishing career spans 50 years. With nearly a century of combined experience in New England’s waters, neither of them are buying the Trump administration’s excuse for pausing Revolution Wind.
“Something about national defense? How can it be an issue of national defense if there are other wind farms out there with the same technology?” pondered Alvernaz. ​“It’s kind of odd.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-02 18:46:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Trump proposed getting rid of FEMA, but his review council seems focused on reforming the agency",Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/02/trump-proposed-getting-rid-of-fema-but-his-review-council-seems-focused-on-reforming-the-agency/,A 12-person review council seems more focused on reforming than dismantling the Federal Emergency Management Agency.,"Four days after starting his second administration, President Donald Trump floated the idea of ” getting rid of ” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages federal disaster response.
But at a meeting last week, the 12-person review council he appointed to propose changes to FEMA seemed more focused on reforms than total dismantlement.
FEMA must be “reformed into an agency that is supporting our local and state officials that are there on the ground and responsive to the individuals that are necessary to help people be healed and whole through these situations,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who co-chairs the council. But, she added, FEMA “as it exists today needs to be eliminated.”
However, the meeting Thursday in Oklahoma City offered hints of what types of reforms the council might present to Trump in its final report. Members mainly focused on conventional and oft-cited opportunities for change, such as getting money faster to states and survivors and enhancing the capacity of local emergency managers.
But some moves by the administration in the last several months have already undermined those goals, as mitigation programs are cut and the FEMA workforce is reduced. Experts also caution that no matter what the council proposes, changes to FEMA’s authority and operations require congressional action.
A Republican-dominated council
Trump created the FEMA Review Council through a January executive order instructing the group to solicit feedback from a “broad range of stakeholders” and to deliver a report to him on recommended changes within 180 days of its first meeting, though that deadline has lapsed.

The 12-person council is co-chaired by Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and vice-chaired by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. It is made up of elected officials, emergency managers and other leaders mostly from Republican states.
Trump “believes we should be in a disaster-response portfolio and footprint,” Noem said at Thursday’s meeting, “but the long-term mitigation should not be something that the federal government is continuing to be involved in to the extent that it has been in the past.”
Noem attended virtually, citing efforts toward “bringing some peace to the streets of Washington, D.C.”
Members on Thursday presented some findings collected in listening sessions conducted in multiple states and with Native tribes. Much of the discussion touched on the need to get money to states more quickly and with more flexibility. Trump and Noem have both supported the idea of giving states federal block grants quickly after a disaster instead of the current reimbursement model.
Members have spent “hours, maybe even days, exploring ways to accelerate local recovery through direct funding for public and individual assistance,” Guthrie said.
Making plans beforehand
Several members emphasized improving preparedness and mitigation before disasters hit.
“Mitigation saves lives, it protects property, it reduces cost of future disasters,” said Guthrie, but added that more responsibility should fall on individuals and state and local governments to invest in mitigation.
States like Texas and Florida have robust, well-funded emergency management agencies prepared for major disasters. Members acknowledged that if other state and local governments were to take on more responsibility in disasters, they still needed training support.
Methods for governments to unlock recovery dollars without relying on federal funds also came up, such as parametric insurance, which provides a rapid payout of a previously agreed-upon amount when a triggering event occurs.
The meeting focused less on individual survivor support, but Bryant brought up the need to reform — and protect — the National Flood Insurance Program, calling it “vital.” That program was created by Congress more than 50 years ago because many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas.
The rhetoric around FEMA is evolving
The conversation signaled a departure from some of the more aggressive rhetoric Trump and Noem have used in the past to describe their plans for FEMA. As recently as June, Trump suggested ” phasing out ” the agency after the 2025 hurricane season.
Michael Coen, who held FEMA posts under three presidential administrations, said after three council meetings, recommendations remain vague.
“Council members provided their perspective but have not identified the challenge they are trying to solve or offered a new way forward,” Coen said.
Coen also cautioned that any significant changes must go through Congress. Lawmakers in July introduced a bipartisan reform bill in the House. The so-called FEMA Act echoes some of the council’s priorities, but also proposes returning FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency.
“Most current proposed FEMA legislation strengthens FEMA,” said Coen.
Actions sometimes contradict words
Some of the administration’s actions so far contradict council members’ emphasis on expediency, mitigation and preparedness.
Noem now requires that she personally approve any DHS expenditure over $100,000. That policy led to delays in the Texas response, according to several reports, though Noem and acting administrator David Richardson have refuted those claims.
The administration halted a multibillion-dollar program for climate resilience projects, and Trump stopped approving hazard mitigation funding requests for major disasters. FEMA abruptly canceled or moved online some local preparedness trainings this spring, though many later resumed.
On Aug. 25, more than 180 current and former FEMA staff sent an opposition letter to the FEMA Review Council and Congress, warning that the agency is so diminished that a major climate event could lead to catastrophe.
At least some of the staff were put on paid administrative leave until further notice on Aug. 26.

An ongoing labor dispute in southeastern Vermont subsided on Labor Day when bus company Travel Kuz ended its lockout of bus drivers and monitors represented by the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 union.
The workers returned to transporting students enrolled in Windham Southeast Supervisory Union’s 10 schools in Brattleboro, Dummerston, Guilford, Putney and Vernon on Tuesday. 
The workers had been on the picket line for nearly two weeks since Travel Kuz locked them out from the company’s Brattleboro headquarters after contract negotiations stalled. The company brought in replacement workers for the start of the school year. 
Travel Kuz accused the union of unlawful picketing and endangering students in a cease-and-desist letter last week. Local law enforcement did not witness any unlawful activity and the Teamsters disputed the characterization. 
A spokesperson for Travel Kuz — affiliated with Beacon Mobility — wrote in a press release that the company ended the lockout because the union is ready to return to the bargaining table. 
“From the start, our hope has been to reach an agreement that is fair for employees and affordable for the town, while keeping the focus on what matters most: children arriving at school safely and returning home with care,” the spokesperson wrote. “We care deeply about our drivers and want to be sure they feel valued and fairly paid for the vital work they do.”
Curtis Clough, president of the Vermont Teamsters Local 597, said the union has “always been available to negotiate with the bus company,” even during the lockout. 
“We’d love to get back to the table with the company,” Clough said. “We’ve already sent the company multiple letters asking for them to come back to the table and negotiate, so hopefully that bears some fruit.”
Lena Melentijevic, spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, wrote in a statement that Travel Kuz notified individual drivers and monitors late Monday afternoon that the lockout ended, but the union has not received direct communication from the company about the situation or future bargaining as of Tuesday.
“The company created a stressful situation for our members and the community,” Melentijevic wrote in a statement. “We call on the company to come back to the table and negotiate a fair contract for our members.”
Travel Kuz previously told VTDigger the union’s proposal would cause an “unrealistic burden” by expanding company costs by over 40%. 
At the Aug. 22 meeting held during the lockout, Clough said, the union adjusted its workers’ pay proposal but maintained its benefits request. He said the Teamsters Local 597 is asking for a contract pay package similar to bus drivers represented by the Teamsters in other states, particularly in New Hampshire. 
Clough said the company has repeatedly delayed workers’ pay, retirement matches and health care premiums, and has asked the union to agree to concessions such as limiting family and medical leave, barring drivers from taking on extra hours and canceling bus monitors’ pay guarantees.
The Vermont Teamsters Local 597’s want a fair contract that ensures members have what they “need to afford to live in the community and afford their health care,” Clough said. 
Windham Southeast Supervisory Union’s Superintendent Mark Speno wrote in a Tuesday statement that he is glad the drivers and monitors are able to return to work while a handful of replacement drivers continue to fill in for some routes. 
The supervisory union is hopeful the contract negotiations settle soon and the bus company makes improvements to the routing and communications systems, according to Speno.
“My expectation is that there is a contract settlement that recognizes support and balance within very few days, so we can all move forward,” Speno wrote.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma signing bonus program, intending to fill a critical workforce shortage in public schools, will reward 151 special education teachers up to $20,000 this school year.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education announced Tuesday the program will award signing bonuses to 34 experienced special education teachers who came from out of state and to 117 new teachers who recently became certified for the first time.
The program exceeded the agency’s initial goal of recruiting 110 special education teachers to work with students with disabilities. About 17% of public school students in Oklahoma are receiving services for a disability, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Out-of-state teachers coming to Oklahoma were eligible for a $20,000 signing bonus this year and another $5,000 in the 2026-27 school year if they remain in the same district. 
Newly certified special education teachers qualified for a $10,000 signing bonus and a potential $2,500 retention bonus next year.
The initiative attracted educators from at least 17 states and Japan, the Education Department reported. Seventy-nine Oklahoma districts are participating.
Recipients of the signing bonuses are moving from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas, the agency said.
Agency spokesperson Madison Cercy said signing bonus recipients coming from California have been instructed to take an “America First” assessment. The Education Department developed the test with the conservative media entity PragerU to weed out educators with “woke agendas” who relocate from progressive states.
The agency also sent the notification to teachers moving from New York, Cercy said, though that state wasn’t one the Education Department initially listed in its announcement of the signing bonuses.
Another state agency that oversees teacher certification testing, the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability, has warned the “America First” test could overstep legal bounds. 
State law mandates that the Oklahoma State Board of Education “shall issue a certificate to teach to a person who holds a valid out-of-state certificate.” Oklahoma statutes require no further assessment besides a criminal history check for teachers who are already certified and moving from out of state.
The state Education Department first announced the $20,000 signing bonuses in April, saying at the time it had budgeted $1.875 million from the federal fund IDEA Part B, which supports students with disabilities.
This is the agency’s third round of signing bonuses for teacher recruitment under state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
Walters has leveraged hefty signing bonuses to attract hundreds of certified educators to return to teaching after having left the profession or to move to Oklahoma from other states.
In 2023, his administration offered between $15,000 and $50,000 to early elementary and special education teachers. The effort drew more than 500 teachers, though the Education Department paid a few by mistake.
The second wave of signing bonuses granted up to $25,000 to educators who accepted hard-to-fill math and science positions in rural middle and high schools. That initiative rewarded 61 teachers last year.
“Through investing in our educators and rewarding excellence we are making sure every child in Oklahoma has the opportunity to succeed,” Walters said Tuesday.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has authorized $1.5 million in emergency spending to help Mora County residents recover from recent flooding, according to a Tuesday news release from her office.
Heavy rainfall between Aug. 26 and 27 caused flood damages on public and private property, according to the governor’s office. The flooding disrupted essential services such as transportation, emergency response and utilities, according to an emergency order the governor signed. 
The order cites continued damage from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, which burned a 485-square-mile area, including much of Mora County, in Northern New Mexico. 
County officials have requested the state’s help with procuring sandbags, along with emergency county-road repair and swift water rescue teams, according to the governor’s office. 
Amid FEMA uncertainty, Western governors commit to more coordination on post-fire flooding

National Weather Service reports show that flash flooding caused small creeks to flow above their banks in at least eight places along NM Highway 518, a major roadway, north of Cleveland, NM. Reports also show “extreme damage” to NM 434 prompted emergency responders to close it for repairs.
The emergency orders fund $750,000 apiece to the state’s emergency management and military affairs departments, according to the governor’s office. The governor can also authorize new funding, $750,000 at a time, as needed. 
Post-fire flooding has occurred repeatedly in and around the burn scar since the 2022 wildfire, which is the biggest in New Mexico history. Those who see damaged or lost property due to flooding are eligible for compensation from the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Fire Assistance Act, a $5.45 billion fund Congress created in late 2022.
The governor’s office said those who have an outstanding claim with the claims office should reach out to their “navigators,” who help claimants through the process, if they have damages from the flooding last week.

In May, Lowell Area Schools Library Media Director Christine Beachler filed a civil suit against Stefanie Boone, whose children attend Lowell Area Schools, citing several false claims painting Beachler as a “smut peddler,” a “pedophile” and accusing her of providing pornography to children. 
Beachler’s case is one of many examples of libraries and librarians facing attacks from right-wing groups like Moms For Liberty who seek to purge books with racially-inclusive or LGBTQ+ content from shelves. 
While Beachler sought relief on the grounds that she’d been portrayed in a false light, and that Boone had intentionally inflicted emotional distress, Boone has filed a counter complaint arguing Beachler “used offensive and inappropriate language regarding Boone in her interviews, documentaries, and podcasts.” 
The countersuit points to several comments Beachler made addressing the attacks against her, arguing Beachler “intends to intimidate, threaten, harass, or annoy Boone and intends to discredit Boone through her own defamation campaign and to gain fame and notoriety.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Among the statements listed in the countersuit, Boone and her attorney, Matthew DePerno, disputed Beachler’s remark on a podcast that she and Boone had never met, and remarks to WOOD TV that she had faced death threats as the result of Boone’s social media posts and that “library books are optional. These are not required materials. These are not curriculum materials.”
Boone and DePerno have requested $250,000 in damages, alleging libel, slander and defamation; false light invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
Boone has also filed a civil rights case against Beachler, the school district and several district employees in 2024 arguing they violated her parental rights. While the district and its employees have filed a motion to dismiss with the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan’s Southern Division, the court has yet to rule on the motion. 
DePerno is running for attorney general following an unsuccessful bid in 2022. He is facing felony charges as part of an alleged scheme to access and tamper with voting machines following the 2020 election, which current President Donald Trump lost to former President Joe Biden. He is also facing three counts of professional misconduct before the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board, according to a report from Bridge Michigan. 
In a response provided by her attorney, Beachler said she is aware of the counterclaims against her and that they have “absolutely no merit.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Photo by Bear Gulch Fire 2025 via Facebook) Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

The effort comes as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration across the country, ramping up arrests and deportations. Immigration courts also already are dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years.
However, numerous immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the administration, according to their union. The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, said in July that at least 17 immigration judges had been fired “without cause” in courts across the country.
That has left about 600 immigration judges, union figures show, meaning the Pentagon move will double their ranks.
The move is being done at the request of the Justice Department, and the memo noted that the details will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewable.
When asked about the move, a DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department. Pentagon officials directed questions to the White House.
A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official said the matter should be “a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25237726982903-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 14:58:11.312355

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that his administration is researching a third immigrant detention facility, this one in West Florida. 
The state-run deportation facilities exising in the Everglades and planned for Baker County are a long distance from the western-most part of Florida, the governor said. 
“There’s a demand to have way more than just Alligator Alcatraz,” DeSantis said, and that immigration law enforcement efforts in the Panhandle recently showed how far away detainees must be transported. 
The first deportation facility, in the Everglades, opened earlier this summer, must be shut down, a federal judge ruled, although the state is fighting that ruling. 
Meanwhile, the state will open another deportation facility in Baker County “soon,” which the governor’s office has dubbed “Deportation Depot.”
Inspired by conversations with law enforcement officials in Panama City, “We’re actually in the process of figuring out how we can set up a Panhandle Pokey,” DeSantis said, continuing an alliterative theme. 
“You know, you’re in the Panhandle sending to Alligator Alcatraz, that’s a long way. Even sending to the Deportation Depot in North Florida, that could be three to five hours depending on where you are in the Panhandle,” DeSantis said.
Everglades facility
Although the Everglades facility has stopped accepting new detainees due to the court ruling, DeSantis said, “We’re ultimately going to win that fight.”
Critics point to the money the state spent on the facility only for it to possibly shut down. “We spent money and we will get reimbursed,” DeSantis said.

,DC,2025-09-02 17:57:39+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democratic AGs disclose FEMA failed to make grants for months to critical disaster program,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-ags-disclose-fema-failed-make-grants-months-critical-disaster-program,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic attorneys general have updated their complaint against the Trump administration in a lawsuit over whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency can refuse to spend pre-disaster mitigation grants approved by Congress.The attorneys general wrote in the new filing that FEMA hadn’t made a single award to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program between April 2 and Aug. 25.“The BRIC program is critically important nationwide. Over the past four years, FEMA has selected nearly 2,000 projects from every corner of the country to receive roughly $4.5 billion in funding,” they wrote. “Due to the unique threats they face, coastal communities have received the largest allocations over the past four years, with California, Louisiana, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Florida, North Carolina, and Washington leading the way. “But interior communities rely on BRIC too: Pennsylvania and Utah have received the next largest allocations, and Ohio is not far behind.”FEMA announced in April that it was “ending” the program and “canceling all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023.” Members of Congress from both political parties brought up their disagreement with that decision in May during a hearing on FEMA’s budget request and by sending a letter signed by more than 80 lawmakers.But that didn’t appear to sway the Trump administration to reverse course and allocate the funding that had been approved by Congress. ‘Devastating’ delays in FEMA fundingDemocratic attorneys general, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro filed their lawsuit in July and later called on the judge to block the Trump administration from moving money out of the pre-disaster mitigation account. U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts Judge Richard G. Stearns, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, issued a preliminary ruling in early August preventing FEMA “from spending the funds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes until the court is able to render a final judgment on the merits.”The updated 83-page complaint filed Friday argues the two people President Donald Trump has installed as acting FEMA administrator did so unlawfully because they were never formally nominated to run the agency, didn’t receive Senate confirmation and didn’t meet the qualifications laid out in federal law.  It also alleges that unilaterally canceling funding approved by Congress, which holds the power of the purse, violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution. “The impact of the shutdown has been devastating. Communities across the country are being forced to delay, scale back, or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects depending on this funding,” they wrote. “Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have invested millions of dollars for planning, permitting, and environmental review are now threatened. And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters.”Each BRIC grant, the updated complaint notes, “can cover up to 75% of a project’s costs, and the federal share can rise to 90% for small rural communities.” Attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado. Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin filed the suit, along with the Pennsylvania and Kentucky governors.",,,,2025-09-02 14:58:11.312355

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The Republican Party of Florida took a moment to celebrate itself on Tuesday, noting that the GOP now enjoys a 10-point voter registration lead over the Florida Democratic Party, 41%-31%. (The official numbers put Republicans at 40.8% and Democrats at 30.7%).
The remaining 28% of voters are either no party affiliation (NPA) or registered with third parties.
Republicans now hold a 1.353 million voter lead over Democrats statewide, the largest lead it has held over Democrats in statewide registration in Florida history.
In a press release, the GOP is boasting about its leads in previously Democratic strongholds like Miami-Dade County (now more than 35,000) and Hillsborough County (more than 17,000), and notes that they are getting closer in Duval and Palm Beach counties.
“This fight is far from over, but make no mistake — Florida is red, and we’re only getting stronger,” said Evan Power, the Republican Party of Florida chairman.
In Palm Beach County, another traditional Democratic powerhouse, the party’s voter registration lead over Republicans is now barely over 2%, according to Michael Pruser, director of data science with Decision Desk HQ.  And in Duval, the Dems have just a 2.5% lead over the GOP.
Florida Democrats had a more than 134,000 lead over registered Democrats going into the 2020 general election. In 2018, when Ron DeSantis needed a recount to defeat Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by less than half a percentage point, the Democrats led Republicans in voter registration with by 263,269.
The increase in GOP voters and attrition of Democratic voters in Florida is now being replicated in many parts of the country. An analysis conducted by The New York Times last month showed that in the 30 states that track voter registration by political party the Democrats have lost 2.1 million registered voters between the 2020 and 2024 elections in those 30 states, while the Republicans gained 2.4 million voters.

(Screenshot courtesy NM Legislature) The head of the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority reported Tuesday that the authority has spent more than one-third of $166 million it’s received from lawmakers in recent legislative sessions.
Isidoro “Izzy” Hernandez, the authority’s executive director, told a legislative oversight committee during a meeting that the authority has spent more than $54 million that lawmakers have awarded the agency since 2024. 
The majority of that, about $29 million, has gone to provide down-payment assistance to first-time homebuyers, according to Hernandez’s presentation. Most of the rest of the funding, while not yet spent, is “awarded,” he said, which means it has been contractually committed to a program or recipient. 
The authority, which recently rebranded as Housing New Mexico, has been among the beneficiaries of a huge increase in state spending aimed at tackling the state’s affordable housing shortage.
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

New Mexico lacks at least 32,000 affordable rental units, according to recent estimates. Homelessness and median rents have also increased at rates higher than the national average in recent years. 
Lawmakers in the 2024 session gave the authority a one-time, $50 million payment for its Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which pays for a range of programs including down-payment assistance, housing rehabilitation and others. 
That’s on top of more than $100 million in recurring funding the authority received over the last three years in severance tax bonds, which come from oil and gas extraction. 
While the authority didn’t receive any extra funding during the session earlier this year, lawmakers approved $140 million for housing and anti-homelessness initiatives for other agencies, overseen by a new Office of Housing. Lawmakers last week celebrated the release of $80 million of that allocation for a range of developments in Bernalillo County. 
While Hernandez and lawmakers lauded the huge increase in funding, they also noted it presented new challenges. Hernandez described the state’s overall approach to housing delivery as “fractured,” citing discrete funding streams coming from the federal Housing Department and the new funds awarded to the Office of Housing.
The Office of Housing is “yet another agency” doing housing, which “potentially complicates things, or at least creates some confusion, with where the money is coming from, and who has access to it, and how it gets underwritten,” he said.
NM Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) said the acute homelessness problem in New Mexico underscores the need for more collaboration and a statewide plan. 
“This is such an important field, it just seems like there should be some coordination …being sure that we weren’t duplicating, being sure we weren’t omitting important parts of the state in providing help with housing,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-02-at-9.26.07-AM-1024x574.png,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Sen. Gary Stubblefield, a Branch Republican who served a dozen years in the Arkansas Senate, died Tuesday at the age of 74. 
The cause of death was unknown, said Senate Information Officer John Reed, who confirmed Stubblefield’s passing to the Advocate Tuesday morning. But the senator’s daughter, JordanAmber Sullivan, posted on social media on Aug. 26 that her father had undergone several surgeries for an unstated condition.
Reed said “the members and staff of the Arkansas Senate mourn the passing” of their colleague, who was elected to the Senate in 2012 after serving two terms in the House of Representatives. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester said in a statement that Stubblefield “was a man of integrity” and committed to “protecting the rights of the unborn” and the Second Amendment. 
“Arkansas was blessed to have such a devoted public servant, and he will be missed dearly,” the Senate leader said.
“Senator Stubblefield’s life reflected a true commitment to public service and a genuine love for Arkansas,” House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans said in a social media post. “His time in the House and later in the Senate was marked by dedication to the people he represented. On behalf of the House, I extend our condolences to his family.”
Stubblefield represented Senate District 26, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian Counties. He won reelection in 2024 for a term that ends in 2029. His seat will be filled by a special election, according to Reed. The governor’s office did not respond to questions about details of the special election by publication.
A life-long dairy farmer and a member of the Baptist church, Stubblefield and his wife Kathi raised two children and “taught them the value of keeping one’s word, a hard day’s work and respecting the rights of others,” according to his Arkansas Senate biography.
Stubblefield “enjoyed a successful career” as a member of the Razorback football team while attending the University of Arkansas. 
“Senator Stubblefield was a strong advocate for his constituents with deeply held conservative values and a fierce love for his family,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a social media post. “He was proud to have walked on and played for @RazorbackFB under legendary Coach Frank Broyles, and he served Arkansans as a State Senator, State Representative, Justice of the Peace, School Board Member, and Farm Service Commissioner.” 
The longtime state lawmaker “sponsored legislation to protect the rights of the unborn and the elderly,” according to his Senate biography.
“He believes in protecting the rights of farmers and livestock growers, and in protecting the rights guaranteed to American citizens under the Second Amendment,” his biography states. “He supports legislation to lower taxes, reduce the size of government and simplify the regulatory burden on Arkansas businesses and residents.”
Stubblefield was chair of the Senate City, County and Local Affairs Committee, which last month hosted a meeting on the state’s prison population. Stubblefield was a vocal critic of a planned prison in Franklin County that is located near his family’s land. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Stubblefield sponsored legislation to require municipal improvement district boards to allow public comments before taking action on an agenda item, according to his Senate biography. He was also the Senate sponsor of a new law restricting the jurisdiction of cities in unincorporated areas, and he co-sponsored a law that allows the over-the-counter sale of Ivermectin for human use.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, said in a social media post that he was deeply saddened by Stubblefield’s passing. 
“While we often found ourselves on opposite sides, we each always knew where the other’d be  — and we could always talk about it,” Leding said.
“My heart is heavy after the passing of Sen. Gary Stubblefield,” Democratic Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock wrote on social media. “Gary was an Ark. character & I mean that in the best way. We often disagreed on policy, but Gary was a man who always followed his convictions & unfailingly treated me with respect & kindness. Rest in peace my friend.”

Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, speaks on the South Dakota House floor on March 5, 2024. Hansen was the sponsor of a 2025 bill that would shorten the time for circulating ballot question petitions, but a judge ruled it unconstitutional. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The state of South Dakota cannot enforce a new law that would shorten the window for circulating ballot question petitions by three months, a judge has ruled.
U.S. District Judge Camela Theeler filed a written order Friday that says the law is a violation of First Amendment rights. As a limitation on political speech, she wrote, moving the election-year deadline from May to February “arguably goes beyond merely inconvenient and enters the realm of severe.”
The filing deadline dictates the amount of time petitioners have to gather the required number of signatures to put a statewide question on the ballot. Petitioners need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, or to put a bill passed by legislators on hold so voters can consider it, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot is 35,017.
Governor candidate grilled on witness stand in lawsuit against shorter petition window

A ballot question committee that has worked on numerous campaigns, Dakotans for Health, filed the lawsuit in April after the Legislature and Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden approved the shorter deadline in March. Dakotans for Health’s leader, Rick Weiland, praised the judge’s decision Tuesday in a news release.
“Once again, our state’s Republican supermajority tried to rig the rules to keep everyday South Dakotans from having a voice in their own government,” Weiland said. “And once again, a court sent them packing.”
The law shortening the deadline started as legislation from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, who is one of several candidates for governor next year. Neither he nor the state Attorney General’s Office — which defended the state in the litigation — immediately responded Tuesday to messages from South Dakota Searchlight. If the state chooses to appeal the ruling, its deadline to file an appeal is Sept. 29.
The legal battle is part of a broader struggle between ballot petitioners and Republican legislators over citizen lawmaking. During this year’s legislative session, for example, Hansen also prime-sponsored a successful bill adding justifications for the secretary of state to reject petition signatures. He cosponsored a bill vetoed by the governor that would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 state Senate districts. Existing law allows signatures to come from registered voters anywhere in the state.
Those and other Republican-led efforts to restrict citizen ballot questions in South Dakota have come in response to the passage of ballot measures that many Republican lawmakers opposed. Examples have included ballot questions that raised the minimum wage, expanded Medicaid eligibility and legalized medical marijuana.

Her burlap-hued dress billowed in the hot wind, carved wooden disc earrings swayed from each lobe, and black mascara lent her stony expression considerable intensity.
She was there Aug. 11 for a hearing that could change the outcome of what she perceived as a great personal tragedy: her daughter’s loss of a homecoming queen election.
“We want the truth,” Sims-Bush wrote on Facebook. “The district is fighting to keep the facts surrounding the results hidden.”
Indianola’s Gentry High School, where Sims-Bush’s daughter is a student, has been holding elections for homecoming queen, or Miss Gentry, since 1954. Recent celebrations included programs printed on metallic foil, two grand thrones moved to the center of a gymnasium festooned with candelabras and chandeliers, rented luxury cars to ride through the annual homecoming parade and a military salute performed by the JROTC befitting a monarch of a lesser but no less grand principality. All this to say, contestants “show out,” in the words of a former school administrator.
But it still came as a surprise to current administrators, when they were sued for $100,000. The accusation against them: stealing a homecoming election for a beloved teacher’s daughter.
Sims-Bush had previously lent her event-planning talent to the school. She decorated a loft space with silver balloons and floats inspired by awards shows for last spring’s prom.
Seven years ago, Sims-Bush transformed the school gymnasium into a medieval courtyard with hedges, gold-colored chairs, sod and a fortress cutout. It was for her elder daughter’s homecoming queen coronation. In 2023, she had changed the gymnasium into an enchanted forest with jungle vines, jewel-toned chairs, fake myrtle trees and a backdrop reminiscent of the forest from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
For 10 years, Sims-Bush has run her event-planning company in the Mississippi Delta. She has hosted galas requiring black tie attire for male attendees and floor-length gowns for female guests. At one of her more recent events at Harlow’s Casino in Greenville, hundreds of guests crowded into a banquet hall for Havana Nights, which featured a cigar bar and performances by fire dancers and contortionists. Guests included local mayors and university administrators. 
Her social media account conveys the impression of a well-connected and highly organized professional.
“She appears to have it all,” said one current teacher on staff, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation at work.
But not quite all.
‘Who will win the throne?’
At Gentry High, the morning announcements in late April heralded the call for nominations for homecoming court. Teachers and administrators gave out handouts with nomination guidelines. Students probably had been mulling a run for homecoming queen much earlier, though. For the confident few, it meant ordering campaign banners and forming a winning strategy with parents and friends since at least February.
“Who will win the throne? What can you do to stand out from the rest! Well … this year we shall see! WELCOME to an unforgettable year of campaigning. Below are the guidelines for this year’s battle,” read Gentry’s handout for 2025 homecoming court elections.
Between hosting Thirsty Thursday, Wine Down Wednesday and more banquets for adults, Sims-Bush found the time to manage her younger daughter’s campaign for the homecoming tiara.
In a professionally produced campaign video released May 12, Sims-Bush’s daughter struts by the campus’ exterior in three separate couture looks.
“A brand isn’t just a logo, a slogan or a catchy name,” she says. “A brand is a promise. I don’t want to just wear the crown, I want to carry the responsibilities that come with it. When you cast your vote, you’re not just choosing a queen, you’re choosing a brand of leadership that’s committed to you.”
Sims-Bush also posted reels from six past homecoming queens entreating followers to cast their votes for her daughter.
“That experience did not only give me the opportunity to wear a crown,” the 2016-2017 queen said in one. “It showed me the importance of character, respect and school spirit.”
Before school started on April 14, a pop-up shop went up in the gym. The bubble gum pink store with glass cases featured free custom hats, tote bags, reusable cups and goodie bags – all stamped with Bush’s homecoming campaign logo: a “V” and “K” in a sleek font reminiscent of luxury branding. 
Sims-Bush arrived on campus each day of the campaign to help set up a new booth. Wednesday it was a Milan-inspired eatery featuring freshly made pizzas and a Kermit-green float. Thursday it was a Chanel-themed mixer with lunch boxes stamped with the designer logo and a shelf of pink-colored mocktails. Friday it was a “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”-inspired buffet. Dozens of strawberries and madeleines covered a table offering muffins from stands. 
On the Friday before voting ended, students and faculty departed their classrooms to see homecoming queen candidates show their talent. A majority of contestants danced to popular music, gyrating in leotards and street wear.
Sims-Bush’s daughter hosted a fashion show with the help of at least 16 classmates. The event boasted a runway and two lines of chairs on either side for spectators. The bass thumped as the teen pageant queen hopeful sashayed down white carpeting in what appeared to be a pink ostrich feather skirt. 
Students left school that Friday with goodie bags from her of hot fries and custom tees. Voting would continue through the weekend.
Sims-Bush said she felt Latoya Henry, the teacher monitoring the campaigns, and Lilly Hamilton, a popular Gentry High teacher, were too friendly. Hamilton’s daughter was the other leading contender.
She expressed her concerns in a series of emails she began writing on the second day of campaign week.
“For a parent to walk into a school and feel the hate is absurd. Henry called me ‘one sided brain’ and stormed out of a meeting because I asked her to provide a set timeframe for activities during campaign week,” Sims-Bush wrote.
“The expectation was for other parents to dumb down their displays to match the basic lackluster display of her friends,” she wrote. “We have been treated so ugly all because of thinking outside the box and campaigning.”
‘The national election doesn’t even take a week’

As early as Tuesday of campaign week, Sims-Bush said she began to doubt the integrity of the upcoming election.
“The voting system is as air tight as we can get it,” replied Superintendent Miskia Davis in an email. “No school or district staff member other than Mr. Jones, a 32 year old white guy from New Jersey has access.”
It was Dylan Jones, that 32-year-old white guy from New Jersey, that Tonia Sims-Bush figured was the mastermind of a scheme to defeat her daughter. She was wary of the Google Form used for the election and the tech-savvy data director monitoring the elections.
She wanted paper ballots.
“While we understand the desire for a process that feels traditional, the reality is that digital voting is vastly more secure, more transparent, and more auditable than paper ballots,” Jones, federal programs and data director, wrote in a handout to parents and staff.
Google’s security software would flag adults who tried to vote with a student email address by identifying the login address and device, he reassured parents in the handout.
Before 7 a.m. the Saturday after campaigning drew to a close, Sims-Bush emailed Davis detailing a conspiracy to steal an election for her daughter’s opponent.
“A 5 day voting window is insane,” she said in an email. “No one had given any good reason why a five day voting window over the weekend is necessary for a student campaign except to cheat. 
The voting had been done on Google Form over the course of several days for at least the past two years.
She convinced Sunflower County Circuit Clerk Carolyn P. Hamilton to process votes in place of the Google Form method, which was already underway.
“Prior to the voting, she contacted me and asked if I could do the voting process instead of the students using Google [Forms]. I informed her that the timing would be tight but if I worked through the weekend I could get it done. I also told her that the School Board will have to approve it before I do anything,” she wrote in a statement to Mississippi Today.
“This would be a one-day process not five,” she stressed. 
‘The Cadillac version of Google’
On May 21, an email announced a runoff election just after 5 p.m.
Sims-Bush’s daughter and Hamilton’s daughter tied. Chromebooks would be dispersed the next day in classrooms – and students would have an hour to vote.
The winner was announced one hour after voting ended.
It wasn’t Sims-Bush’s daughter.
The following morning, Sims-Bush alleged fraud in an official complaint to the school district and requested it look into whether anyone but a student had voted in the election.
“After the runoff election voting window closed, the superintendent published the certified results, naming the daughter of the faculty member, who had unrestricted access to student accounts, and the openly acknowledged bestie of the staffer facilitating the election process the winner,” she wrote in her complaint.
Mississippi Today could not verify whether Hamilton had “unrestricted access.”
Four years prior, a Pensacola, Florida, assistant principal and her daughter were charged with rigging a homecoming queen election. The mother and daughter had access to student emails. A teacher responsible for administering the student election saw that 117 votes were flagged as “false” by Election Runner, an app that runs secure student elections for the district. An investigation followed. The daughter was expelled and charged as an adult after coronation.
Sims-Bush said she found it suspicious that a runoff was called without the vote tally posted.
“As a participant’s parent, I reiterate my request for a review of the May 20th election results,” she added.
Within a week, Sims-Bush had retained counsel and submitted a public records request to inspect the voting records.  
She wanted to examine the generated spreadsheet’s time stamps to see if votes were added after the official voting window had closed – and whether each voter was a student in the school by looking at “digital footprint.”
The school district refused. 
In the district office’s conference room, between a plea for cooperation on an oral history project and the honoring of a former superintendent, Sims-Bush made her concerns known during the June 10 school board meeting. A video recording of the meeting was posted online by Mic Magazine, a Facebook page that covers locals news in the Mississippi Delta.
More soft-spoken, Sims-Bush, reading from prepared notes, rattled off complaints and spoke to the injustices her family faced. 
“It has been horrible. What started as a campaign issue has unraveled so many flawed systems. All types of chaos,” she said. “The goal here is to get official documented results from the school leadership campaign. Dylan Jones made it clear that you pay $1,000 a year for the Cadillac version of Google. We have that recorded. So there shouldn’t be any reason why we shouldn’t be able to see the official results as opposed to something that someone just typed up. ”
She then looked up from her notes to address the board directly. The air conditioning churned.
“Thank you,” said Debra Jones, the school board member for District 3.
The rest of the school board offered no comment.
Two days later, Sims-Bush through attorney Dale Dean filed a lawsuit against Davis, the high school’s principal and Jones to compel them to allow inspection of the “digital footprint” of each voter and time stamps on the generated spreadsheet.
She also wanted $100,000 for “mental anguish,” the cost of filing the claim, loss of economic opportunity, past medical expenses and other enumerated damages.
“I have largely ignored you during this process, as I believe my God-given energy should not be wasted on foolishness,” assistant superintendent William Murphy wrote in his “final” email on the subject.
“This is clearly a sign that the election has gotten you completely outside of yourself.”
‘We are talking about high school students’
Eleven weeks after Hamilton’s daughter was declared the winner, Sims-Bush sat in a mostly empty Greenwood courtroom in the company of friends, family and counsel. 
When Circuit Judge Richard A. Smith took his seat, whispers between counsel and client fell to a hush. The school district’s attorney began oral arguments.
“We are talking about high school students,” Mackenzie Price said.
She spoke of the potential for bullying should the metadata or “digital footprint” be made available for Sims-Bush to inspect. 
“It would bleed into the hallways,” Price added.
Sims-Bush would have access to the addresses of students if they voted from home and to student names by even glimpsing at the initials listed on the generated spreadsheet. It would be a violation of the Family Education and Right Privilege Act.
The plaintiff wanted to know who her friends’ kids voted for, she interpreted. She was a “disgruntled parent.” Sims-Bush shook her head and looked to her aunt for support.
“The cloud over this matter” is why we’re here today, Dean responded. “All matters of unethical things” and “shenanigans” have taken place. Counsel has submitted “quite voluminous briefs” to “confuse the court.”
He held up case law that had since been overruled as justification for his client’s right to inspect the election metadata. Price noted that case law in asking for a summary judgment for the school district. The judge agreed.
The proceeding was over within an hour. 
“Parents now, and I’m guessing going forward, have to rely on the word of people in a district known for fraud, forgery and misconduct when it comes to student elections and other student issues,” Sims-Bush wrote in a comment on Facebook. “It’s sad.”
‘Money can’t buy everything’
She followed her counsel to the hallway outside the courtroom for a huddle. They were discussing strategy and a possible appeal.
“The district adamantly denies any allegations that it was involved in any politics regarding a student election,” said Carlos Palmer, attorney for Sunflower County Consolidated School District. “This particular suit that was filed completely lacked merit and was a waste of district resources that could’ve been better used educating the school’s students.”
The district’s insurance rate could be raised because of the lawsuit, he said. 
In the 12 years he has represented school districts, he said he has never come across a lawsuit stemming from a homecoming queen election or any other student personality contest.
Asked to describe personal damages incurred from the alleged theft of the homecoming queen crown, Sims-Bush refused comment on three separate occasions.

On Aug. 17, Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons honored Sims-Bush for bringing “regional and national attention to Greenville” and for elevating “the Mississippi Delta as a destination for luxury weddings, sophisticated celebrations and world-class event design.”
When Sims-Bush exited the Leflore County courthouse, she had not let her counsel know whether an appeal would be filed. As of Monday, an appeal has not yet been filed.
“We don’t want student info, we want the truth,” Sims-Bush wrote on Facebook. “What started as a campaign issue is now an issue of moral and ethics.”
“August 20 will be three months and we still have no true results,” she recently posted.
But in town, locals had other ideas about what took place in the Miss Gentry contest in May. Mississippi Today was able to poll half a dozen local residents.
“Money can’t buy everything,” said Tawana, a Popeye’s employee in Indianola and a Gentry alum who wished to be identified by her first name because she has family that attend the school. “Loyalty is something, too. They voted correctly. That’s that situation. You can’t sue nobody for that, neither.”
Gentry High School’s homecoming is Oct. 17.
In conversations with three past Miss Gentry winners, Mississippi Today was able to confirm that the perks of the crown are limited to appearances at schoolwide events, riding on a float during the homecoming parade and free access to home games. The title carries no cash prize, no scholarship money and no keepsake except the crystal encrusted metal crown bestowed upon the winner. In some years, there is a scepter, too.
One Miss Gentry from 20 years ago theorized that the competition became more fierce and pricey when social media became part of homecoming court election strategy.
“It used to just be about fun,” shared a former Miss Gentry who won her tiara nearly two decades ago. “Parents were not involved. I sang badly to a gospel recording and won because I could make people laugh.”
“It’s still one of the happiest days of my life.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/02093537/Gentry-Homecoming-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

Free.,Judge warns of 'national police force' in ruling Trump broke the law sending Guard to LA,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-warns-national-police-force-ruling-trump-broke-law-sending-guard-la,,"President Donald Trump’s move to send National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles this summer violated a federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement, a federal judge in California ruled early Tuesday.The ruling from Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer represents an obstacle to any further use of National Guard troops to assist local police in more cities. Following deployments to LA and Washington, D.C., Trump has openly mused about federalizing other state National Guard troops and sending them to major cities like Chicago and Baltimore he says are overwhelmed with crime.Breyer, whom Democratic President Bill Clinton appointed in 1997, said Trump could not use the National Guard for a wide array of police activities in California. His order goes into effect Sept. 12.Breyer said the roughly 4,700 Guard members and Marines engaged in police activity in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which he said built on the constitutional framers’ wariness of a centralized military force conducting police work.“Contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws,” Breyer wrote in a 52-page opinion. “Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.”National Guard expandedThe judge expressed concern about Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s statements they wanted to expand the role of National Guard troops for law enforcement.“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country… thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” he wrote.The issue itself dates much further back in U.S. history, forming part of the basis for the country’s break from the English monarchy, Breyer noted.“Indeed, resentment of Britain’s use of military troops as a police force was manifested in the Declaration of Independence, where one of the American colonists’ grievances was that the King had ‘affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power,’” he wrote.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who sued to block Trump’s federalization of the state’s National Guard, said the ruling “sided with democracy and the Constitution” and echoed Breyer’s warning about Trump leading a national police force.“No president is a king — not even Trump — and no president can trample a state’s power to protect its people,” Newsom said. “Trump’s attempt to use federal troops as his personal police force is illegal, authoritarian, and must be stopped in every courtroom across this country.”Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also cheered the decision.“The White House tried to invade the second largest city in the country,” she wrote. “That’s illegal. Los Angeles will not buckle and we will not break. We will not be divided and we will not be defeated.”Spokespeople for the White House did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Return to appeals court likelyTrump is likely to appeal the ruling to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where he won a victory early in the case.After Breyer issued a temporary restraining order in June calling on Trump to return control of the state’s National Guard to Newsom, a 9th Circuit panel unanimously blocked it from going into effect, ruling that U.S. Supreme Court precedent allowed Trump to make the determination that the proper circumstances existed to federalize National Guard troops.That appeals ruling dealt with Breyer’s finding that Trump likely violated the president’s legal authority to federalize National Guard troops.The appeal did not consider potential Posse Comitatus Act violations, Breyer said Tuesday.",,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has again earned a AAA credit rating — the highest possible — from the three major credit-rating agencies, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s administration announced Tuesday.
“Indiana’s AAA rating is more than a financial milestone,” Braun said in a news release. “It’s a signal to taxpayers, investors, and businesses that our state is well-managed, fiscally responsible, and focused on delivering growth for Hoosiers throughout the State.”
 Indiana Gov. Mike Braun talks at a news conference on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Just 14 states have top marks from the trio of major credit-rating agencies, which include S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings.
Indiana has held an AAA rating from all three since 2010. Its most recent ratings came in September 2024, this April and in June.
The trio lauded the Hoosier State for active budget management, low debt, strong and transparent fiscal policies, and budgetary reserves that provide the foundation for an economy that has benefited from recent economic development investments, according to the news release.
“The AAA rating is the gold standard and allows Indiana to borrow at lower interest rates,” said Indiana Secretary of Management and Budget Lisa Hershman.
“That saves taxpayer dollars and strengthens the state’s ability to invest in infrastructure, education, and public services,” she added. “It also strengthens Indiana’s competitive edge in attracting new business and expanding economic opportunity statewide.”

(Getty Images)A mine manager from Kentucky pleaded guilty last week to conspiring to cover up a fire and keep miners working despite the danger in an underground coal mine in southern Illinois.
Timothy Brandon Parsons, 38, of Louisa, Kentucky, entered a guilty plea Aug. 29 to conspiring to defraud the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.
Parsons was mine manager at the MC#1 Mine in Franklin County, Illinois, in August 2021 when a cutting torch ignited a fire underground.
“When the fire could not be extinguished within 10 minutes, rather than implementing the approved Mine Emergency Evacuation and Firefighting Plan, Parsons and conspirators agreed that they would not evacuate miners or notify MSHA,” says a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice that describes Parsons as “former manager” of the Illinois mine.
“Gas detectors carried by miners alarmed for the presence of more than 10 parts per million of carbon monoxide, yet the mine continued to mine coal during ad hoc firefighting efforts over the course of three shifts from Aug. 12 to 13.”
The Justice Department release says Parsons “tried to conceal the existence of the fire from those not already aware of it by evacuating the mine on the false pretense that a belt used to carry coal from underground to the surface was broken.
“Later that morning, MSHA received an anonymous tip about the fire and then later ordered that the mine be evacuated after inspectors confirmed the existence of the fire. 
“Despite the evacuation order, over the next several days, conspirators re-entered the mine on two occasions without MSHA’s permission to assess the fire and manipulate the conditions underground so that MSHA would allow mining to resume. Members of the conspiracy did not wear tracking devices designed to track the underground location of miners and made false entries in mine records,” the Justice Department said.
The Department of Labor Office of Inspector General and FBI investigated the case.
Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 18.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-96390221-coal-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

Property tax cuts and shrinking grants pinch county budgets as Wyoming towns turn to volunteers to keep libraries going.
The post Big Horn County closes two libraries, cuts staff salaries and benefits appeared first on WyoFile .","GREYBULL—“They’re gutting our little community,” Chelsea Yates of Deaver said, holding back tears, as she addressed the Big Horn County Library Board at its Aug. 12 meeting.
The Big Horn County library system faces a $70,000 cut in county funds this year, 20% of last year’s budget. As a result, the county’s three largest libraries — Lovell, Basin and Greybull — have faced reduced hours and the removal of benefits for all staff members. 
Its smallest libraries, Frannie and Deaver, were closed permanently Monday.
Next year, property tax cuts are expected to deplete the budget even more.
Commission cuts
“Why are we getting these cuts this year? That is something I have asked, and [the commissioners] don’t have an answer… They told us 10% and we could have dealt with that… and then they said 20%,” library board member Lea Sorensen said at the August meeting.
Commissioners made cuts across the board this budget season, with elections taking a 59% hit, emergency management down 55% and local emergency planning down 30% — to name a few. Grant money overall, including American Rescue Plan Act funds, has been reduced, leaving Big Horn County Search and Rescue with almost $57,000 less in its budget.
The commission did not reply to requests for comment by the Greybull Standard’s deadline.
“We have cut to the bone. I don’t know where else we can cut,” Sorensen said of the library budget.
Library board president Nikole Greene and board member Cari Waterworth attended the Big Horn County Commissioners’ Aug. 5 meeting to address maintenance costs on the county-owned library buildings in Basin and Lovell, amounting to $9,419 covered through the library’s budget.
Currently, the Lovell library pays $1,292 a year in grounds maintenance.
Library Director Tina Ely reported to the board that in Basin, utility bills range from $700-$800 a month. Custodian wages amount to $7,377 for both libraries. 
The library board asked for county assistance in covering maintenance costs and, in turn, was presented with a lease proposal. Lovell and Basin libraries have operated out of county-owned buildings with no lease in place since their implementation. 
County Maintenance Supervisor Jeremy Pouska said that in the past, the county has been happy to help the libraries with maintenance when requested. However, there is no written agreement as to what each entity is expected to address. 
Upon notification of the library board members’ attendance, the county drafted a lease agreement for the Basin library “in an effort to be equitable” to all the organizations that lease county buildings. Leadership was uncertain of the Lovell building’s status at the time and, therefore, unprepared to propose a similar agreement for that building.
“Everybody’s hurting, and unfortunately, we just think next year is going to be even worse with the property tax stuff.”Deb Craft, Big Horn County Commission Chair
The lease would require the library to maintain the building’s day-to-day upkeep, while the county maintains the grounds. The suggested rent would be $1 a year.
“I mean, you need to come up with $9,500, I don’t know where we would get it. We just cut everything back,” Commissioner Mike Jolley said to the library board members.
County Commission Chair Deb Craft added: “Everybody’s hurting, and unfortunately, we just think next year is going to be even worse with the property tax stuff.”
Librarians take a hit 
On top of reduced staff hours — Lovell losing 10 a week, Greybull and Basin down 12 — librarians in all three counties have agreed to take on some janitorial duties to reduce that part of the library budget.
“There’s so much that these women, because they’re all women… are doing other than checking books in and checking books out,” Ely told the board. “Their hours are considerably cut, and we’re just hoping they can still continue to get all of that programming done and get all of that stuff done with less hours.”  
“While asking them to maintain buildings,” Greene added, with no workers’ compensation. 
Three library managers and Ely agreed to give up their Wyoming retirement benefits, amounting to $24,000. Commissioners requested confirmation on the legality of this concession; should it prove faulty, that money will have to be cut elsewhere.  
In addition, all library employees gave up their three personal paid days off. 
Ely forfeited reimbursement for her mileage driving between towns. Troy  Butler, who handles the library’s bookkeeping, agreed to a 20% decrease in the fees for his accounting services.  
Before cuts, Lovell salaries were $51,000, Basin $50,000 and Greybull  $45,000 for three employees in each branch.  
Commissioners suggested a cut to Ely’s $42,000 salary to add hours for payroll and grant writing to managers’ positions.  
“When this county ran into having to cut people before, the people within the departments agreed to cut their wages so that a person didn’t get cut. (Those were) sacrifices that this county’s departments have made before,  so I think they can look a little deeper here,” Craft said.
Grants and Friends of the Library donations are not able to cover salaries or operating expenses. 
“It’s our ox that got gored and died.” Melvyn Wambeke
Frannie and Deaver
Frannie and Deaver’s libraries are run out of town-owned buildings at no charge to the county. 
Between the two of them, the county budgeted $8,000 for salary. The library board voted to cut this funding, essentially shuttering the libraries, effective Monday.  
Several members of the Deaver community attended the August library board meeting.  
“It’s our ox that got gored and died,” citizen Melvyn Wambeke told the board.  
Previously, Melvyn and Sally Wambeke had proposed a 25% cut in Frannie and Deaver’s library hours — already only operating four hours a week —  to be equalized by cuts in the larger libraries’ hours. This would prevent a 100% shutdown, the Wambekes suggested.  
However,  the closure decision had already been finalized, and the library board did not double back, noting concerns that even more cuts would have to be made to the budget. 
Board members apologized to the Deaver and Frannie communities, saying that they did not want the closures.  
“By statute, we have one library to provide per county,” Commissioner Craft said Aug. 5.
She added that due to the size of the county, she believed a north and south library are needed.  
The library board voted to close the Frannie-Deaver bank account, which put roughly $200 back in the library’s general fund. The towns of Frannie and Deaver have stepped up to keep their libraries open without county assistance.
They will lose roughly 60 books between the two towns but maintain the library donations their communities have generated over the years, the majority of their shelves.  
The Town of Deaver voted last month to keep the library open with volunteer help, pending approval from the town’s insurance provider. This should add no additional costs to the town’s budget.  
“I think there’s a lot of people and kids that use it. I know there’s not a lot of heavy traffic, but the library is a value added, an asset to our community,”  Deaver Mayor Bill Camp said in an interview with the Greybull Standard.
“We value education, which it’s a part of, and encourage everybody to use it in some way,” he said. 
The Town of Frannie has instated a similar system. The library board has requested a bookmobile from Park County be brought to Frannie, as it spans county lines.  
Deaver and Frannie residents will still be able to use county-owned books, but no longer through their local libraries. Libraries will lean heavily on volunteers to ease the burden on librarians this year.  
“Even with doing this, we are a sinking ship of volunteers trying to keep our county with some sort of library system, period,” Sorensen said.

(Photo by John Raoux/The Associated Press)Workers’ compensation insurance rates in Florida should decrease by an average 6.9% in 2026 under a proposal by the National Council on Compensation Insurance.
Submitted last month, the NCCI’s proposed reduction is a recommendation only. Rates are set by the Florida Commissioner of Insurance, usually after a public hearing.
The recommended filing is based on experience data for policy years 2022 and 2023 as of year‐end 2024. The proposed reduction is being driven by declines in lost-time claim frequency, according to a summary from NCCI.
“The workers compensation system remains healthy. For the last decade, the system has broadly benefited from a steady drop in claim frequency, rising wages, and moderate severity. The changing workforce and evolving economy also continue to impact workers compensation,” the summary notes.
Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system that aims to protect employers from getting sued by injured employees and, in exchange, employers provide employees injured on the job the care they need to return to work. Employers are required to provide compensation for lost wages if an employee misses more than eight days of work due to an on-the-job injury.
Most employers in Florida are required to carry workers’ compensation insurance but there are exceptions for businesses with four or fewer employees and for construction companies with four or fewer officers. While those firms aren’t mandated to carry the coverage, they are required to file for exemptions with the state. Data show that 203,365 employers filed for exemptions with the state in calendar year 2024.
Workers’ compensation affects a large and disparate group of interests, including business groups, labor unions, insurance companies, plaintiffs’ attorneys, and injured workers. Because of that, workers’ comp bills in the Florida Legislature attract a spate of special interests, and getting changes passed through the Legislature and signed into law isn’t always easy.
A 2025 review of 50 states and Washington, D.C., workers’ compensation rates by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Businesses Services shows Florida ranked No. 30 in the nation for workers’ comp costs in 2024. That’s an improvement from the previous analysis of 2022 premium data, when Florida ranked No. 28 for workers’ comp premiums.
Hawaii had the highest workers’ compensation costs in 2024, according to the report, followed by New Jersey, New York, California, and Vermont. North Dakota had the lowest rates in the nation.
If the proposed reduction (or a modified reduction) is approved, it will be the ninth consecutive year in which workers’ compensation rates have been ordered reduced by the state’s insurance commissioner. Florida Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky on Nov. 18 last year ordered an average 1% rate decrease in workers’ compensation rates effective Jan. 1.

Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.

Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department is implementing new fees at some of its day-use parks and raising fees for some of its busiest overnight camping parks.
The state waives day-use parking fees at more than 225 of its state parks, with only 25 parks charging the $10 fee for in-state visitors and $12 for people visiting from out of state. But on Oct. 1, the department will begin requiring the parking fee at an additional 21 of its day-use parks, including:

Beverly Beach State Park
Bullards Beach State Park
Cline Falls State Scenic Viewpoint
Crown Point State Scenic Corridor
Dexter State Recreation Site
Face Rock State Park
Farewell Bend State Recreation Area
Fort Stevens State Park
Harris Beach State Recreation Site
Hat Rock State Park

Lowell State Recreation Site
Oswald West State Park
Prineville Reservoir State Park
South Beach State Park
Starvation Creek State Park
Sunset Bay State Park
Tolovana Beach State Recreation Site
Tryon Creek State Natural Area
Valley of the Rogue State Recreation Area

The fees won’t apply to visitors who walk, bike, use public transportation or have a valid 12- to 24-month parking permit from Oregon State Parks.
These parks are some of the busiest parks in the system, according to a news release from the department. For example, Harris Beach State Park experienced an estimated 2 million day-use visits in 2024.
The changes are meant to supplement a 14% budget shortfall because of increasing costs, record visitation and a reduction in lottery funds for operations. The fee adjustments, along with internal efforts to reduce costs, will help maintain current service levels and ensure the system remains accessible in the future, the department said in the release.
Trump administration advances plan to reverse federal rule that limits logging in national forests

The park system raised day-use fees from $5 to $10 at the start of 2025, its first increase in 15 years.
Lottery funds cover a little less than half of Oregon State Parks’ budget, followed by 15% from recreational vehicle license plate fees and 35% from park fees from visitors.
“State parks are some of the most beloved spaces in Oregon, but we have struggled as a state to sustainably fund them,” Oregon Parks and Recreation Department Director Lisa Sumption said in the news release. “We’re working to reimagine the future of Oregon State Parks as a financially resilient system that will serve generations to come.”
The department is also increasing overnight rates at 29 of its busiest parks starting May 2025 to $29 a night for tents and $52 for full RV hook-ups. The rate change will apply from May 1 to Sept. 30 and apply year-round on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

 To save on parking, Oregon State Parks offers a 12-month parking permit for $30 and a 24-month permit for $50.

The parks include:

Alfred A. Loeb State Park
Ainsworth State Park
Beachside State Recreation Site
Beverly Beach State Park
Bullards Beach State Park
Cape Blanco State Park
Cape Lookout State Park
Carl. G. Washburne Memorial State Park
Champoeg State Heritage Area

Oregon State Parks will also increase all its cabin and yurt prices to a range between $72 to $129 a night, boat moorage fees will increase from $15 to $20 and overnight parking and overflow camping and primitive camping fees will increase from $10 to at least $15 a night.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”

Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

(Photo Courtesy of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation)It was the deadliest massacre of indigenous people in U.S. history. But today, many still don’t know the story.
It was 1863, on an icy January morning, at dawn. Hundreds of members of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation were sleeping where they had settled for the winter along the Bear River, or as they call it, “Wuda Ogwa.”
The Shoshone Nation were a nomadic tribe, but every winter they would make this place their home, near what’s now known as Preston, Idaho. There, they’d fish for trout and hunt game birds. Hot springs nearby warmed the ground, heating their tepees and lodges, and giving their horses a place to graze in an otherwise frost-bitten landscape.
But that day, the tribe was nearly entirely wiped out.
U.S. military soldiers — led by Col. Patrick Edward Connor — set out from Ft. Douglas, Utah, toward Chief Bear Hunter’s camp, reportedly in retaliation for Shoshoni raids. The soldiers killed an estimated 300, including women and children, according to historians, though tribal leaders say it was more, closer to 500. Connor reported his troops counted 224 bodies, destroyed more than 70 lodges, seized 175 horses, and captured 160 women and children, according to National Park Service records.
Though they were few, some of the Northwestern Band survived. Today, their descendants are working to reclaim the site of the massacre as their home — and restore its natural ecosystem.
“This is a graveyard. This is our Arlington Cemetery,” Brad Parry, vice chairman of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation’s tribal council, said in a PBS documentary about the tribe’s restoration project. “This is where our people had to fight for their freedom to exist.”



“I want to take this land back in time, to when it was wild,” Parry continues. “And restore our connection to it.”
 Tribal leaders want to turn their grief into healing

Parry and other tribal leaders held a forum Wednesday at the Northwestern Band’s tribal office in Ogden, Utah, to share the massacre’s history — and also share how the tribe is working to restore the land.
There, Parry told a room of more than 140 people that his grandmother, Mae Timbimboo Parry, learned about the massacre directly from her grandfather, Yeager Timbimboo, who was about 12 years old when the attack happened. To survive, he hid among dead bodies.
“He laid on the frozen ground, playing dead,” Parry said. “A soldier saw him playing dead, raised his rifle at him three times, but didn’t shoot.”
Now, more than 160 years later, Parry is leading the effort to give the site of the massacre new life. Though its history is fraught with horrific bloodshed, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that tribal leaders want to turn their grief into healing.
“We’ve wallowed long enough. We’ve been sad long enough. This has been detrimental long enough. Let’s flip the script,” he said. “Let’s take it back to what our ancestors would recognize and start bringing the community back to the land. And not just indigenous communities, but all communities.”

Since the Bear River Massacre, the Northwestern Band hasn’t had any land to call home. Their tribe was never given a reservation.
But in 2018, the tribe purchased about 350 acres of land around the massacre site. Their goal, Parry said, is to restore it to its wild, natural state, and to help the river’s ecosystem thrive.
And because all things in nature are connected — what happens in one ecosystem can affect another — the efforts to restore that section of the Bear River can have a cascading effect on a downstream neighbor that’s in dire need.

 How the Wuda Ogwa restoration could bring more water to the Great Salt Lake

The Bear River is the largest tributary of the Great Salt Lake, which has been shrinking to dangerously low levels due to drought, climate change and water diversion for agriculture and development. Today, the lake remains on the brink of ecological collapse.
The drying Great Salt Lake poses an existential threat to not only the wildlife that rely on its waters and wetlands, but also to people. Less water means more exposed lake bed, leading to dust storms laced with cancer-causing carcinogens like arsenic. In Utah, leaders are all in agreement — for the sake of Utah’s future, the Great Salt Lake must be saved.
And the Wuda Ogwa restoration project could play a part.

Tribal leaders say researchers’ models have predicted that the restoration of Bear River natural habitats could help send an estimated 13,000 acre-feet of water to the Great Salt Lake a year by ripping out water-sucking invasive plants and replacing them with native plants, cleaning out creeks, and restoring old agricultural fields to wetlands.
 

 This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.



The Great Salt Lake needs every drop of water it can get, so that amount of water isn’t insignificant — but it would far from solve the lake’s crisis. It needs about 8 to 15 more vertical feet of water (the equivalent of two Bear Lakes) to be healthy, according to the Great Salt Lake Collaborative.
And whether that water will actually flow all the way to the Great Salt Lake is still an open question. The tribe has secured water rights for the project, Parry said, but because it crosses state lines, tribal leaders have encountered challenges from leaders in Idaho during water rights adjudication discussions.
“One of the biggest problems that we’ve found is the state above you — their users don’t care about the Great Salt Lake,” Parry said. “I can say that because we’ve been involved in adjudication, and instead of asking how they can protect their water rights, (they ask), ‘Are you guys doing this for the Great Salt Lake?’”
Asked to clarify those comments, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that in talking with Idaho state officials and irrigation farming districts in Idaho, “their goal isn’t to help us save the Great Salt Lake.”
Parry said the tribe has its own, primary reasons for wanting to restore the land and the wetlands — but the benefits to the Great Salt Lake would be a positive consequence of the restoration that the tribe also supports.
He added that tribal leaders have found that the further away from the Great Salt Lake, there’s less interest in helping save it. But he argued “we’re all in this together,” and the impacts from toxic dust from the dried lake bed would be far-reaching, including potentially in other states like Idaho.
“If the states don’t start working with each other, it’s never going to happen,” he said.
 The Wuda Ogwa restoration project

Parry said the tribe has secured roughly $13 million in various state and federal grants and other funding sources for the river restoration project.
During Wednesday’s forum, tribal leaders and researchers detailed how after the Bear River Massacre, colonial settlement transformed what was once the Bear River’s natural bends and wetlands into farm and grazing land. Since then, it has become a shadow of what it once was.
Now, thanks to the help of volunteers on weeding and planting days, the tribe is working to remove invasive plants and replace them with native vegetation. They’re also working with engineers and biologists to reshape the river and its wetlands to a more natural state to help attract back fish, birds and other wildlife.

One of the biggest foes they’re working to root out is the Russian Olive. The thorny, invasive tree that sucks up massive amounts of water has taken over the river shoreline.
Brian Andrew, an engineer at the firm Hansen Allen and Luce that’s been hired by the tribe for the project, said there are an estimated 400,000 Russian Olive plants on a 60-acre area of the site. A mature Russian Olive tree consumes an estimated 75 gallons of water a day and crowds out other native plants like willows and cottonwoods.
Early in the project, Parry said tribal leaders envisioned building a geothermal heated amphitheater and cultural interpretative center. But he said the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted funding, and construction costs have since skyrocketed.
Now, Parry said the tribe is focused on restoring the land first and foremost, now envisioning a trail system as a way for members of the public to experience the wetlands once they’re thriving.
So far, the tribe’s partners estimate they’ve planted and seeded about 69,000 native plants over 111 acres. Between 2025 and 2027, they expect to plant an additional 130,000 over 250 acres.
Parry said with $13 million in funding that’s already been secured, they’ve made good progress — but he said tribal leaders continue to ask for donations since “we’re always looking for funding,” especially for monitoring the project’s impact on the ecosystem.
“Another $5 to $10 million wouldn’t hurt,” he said.

To read more about the project, click here.

It’s a familiar and daunting headline: Mississippi is bleeding talent. Our best and brightest—our  kids, our neighbors, our future—are leaving for cities and states that seem more alive, more  prosperous, more like the opportunity they are seeking.
According to data from the Mississippi  Institutions of Higher Learning and Mississippi State University’s National Strategic Planning and Analysis Research Center (NSPARC), just 52% of our public university graduates are working in the state three years after earning their degrees and that number drops to 49% by year five. U.S. Census data shows we have lost more than 60,000 millennials, in a state of about 3 million, since 2010.  
We’ve seen education reform, workforce programs and tax breaks, but we’re overlooking a game-changer right under our noses: tourism. It’s not just about visitors, but the quality of place and community tourism creates when done well. As one of Mississippi’s largest industries, tourism sparks entrepreneurship, creates vibrant communities and fosters pride of place. In short, it is one of our most effective yet underrecognized tools to retain and attract talent. It gives young people a reason to stay and a story worth telling.

I have seen firsthand how tourism can transform communities. I have watched a blues festival fill the air with music and the sidewalks with locals and visitors from around the world. Restaurants were packed, shops were busy and a once-quiet downtown was bustling. The festival wasn’t just an event. It was proof that a place once written off as “dying” could reinvent itself as a cultural  destination.  
Mississippi is rich with genuine, generous people who are the heart of our great state. Tourism, along with programs like Main Street, has been steadily developing communities worthy of our  people. This work lays the foundation for attracting residents who want professional opportunity, quality of life and a sense of belonging.  
Tourism’s role in reversing brain drain 
Brain drain is not just about jobs. Young professionals want more than a paycheck. They want communities with character, cultural vibrancy and opportunities to connect. Tourism  development builds these qualities. 
When a town invests in assets like music, food, outdoor recreation and historic preservation, it is  also investing in things that enrich life for residents. A hiking trail attracts tourists and gives locals a place to connect with nature. A festival fills hotels and creates experiences for the people who live there. A revitalized downtown becomes a place where residents want to shop, work and open businesses. 
In discussing future plans with my millennial niece who lives out of state, I asked if she would ever consider moving back home. She said the lack of outdoor recreation opportunities was one of the main reasons she planned to stay where she was. As a Gen Xer, this surprised me as we followed jobs and built our lives around them. She is mapping her future around lifestyle amenities that are important to her.
As a tourism leader, her response was a gut punch, and it solidified how crucial it is to invest in quality-of-life assets if we want the next generation to live here. Mississippi has incredible natural resources, but we often lag behind other states in developing outdoor amenities that are accessible to visitors and residents. 
Tourism doesn’t just create jobs and revenue; it creates reasons to stay. 
A powerful economic engine in plain sight 
In 2023, Mississippi welcomed a record 43.7 million visitors, generating $17.5 billion in cash-in hand economic development. Those dollars don’t just fill hotel rooms; they fuel small  businesses.

Tourism shapes Mississippi’s story 
If we want to keep and bring back our best and brightest, we must leverage tourism to own and amplify our story.  
For too long, much of the national narrative about Mississippi has been written by people who have never lived here. In 2019, state leaders created a dedicated funding model for tourism marketing, allowing Mississippi tourism to finally compete regionally and nationally. That investment has driven growth in GDP, tax revenue and economic development, but I believe our  best is yet to come.

Longwoods International conducted a study on the “Halo Effect” of tourism marketing. The study found that when people saw tourism ads and then visited a destination, their perception of that place improved dramatically across key economic indicators. Tourism leaders have long understood this connection, but the data confirmed that tourism directly influences how places are viewed as desirable locations to live, work and invest. 
For Mississippi, this means our festivals, coastal trails and warm hospitality can rewrite outdated perceptions. Tourism doesn’t just bring revenue; it builds pride and possibility. 
The front door to economic growth and development 
In economic development, talent attraction is a constant priority. States invest heavily in courting companies and industries, but these efforts work best when paired with a thriving tourism sector. 
No one moves or invests without first visiting.
It all starts with a visit, and the visit starts with us. Tourism is often the first impression Mississippi makes with future residents, business owners and investors. A positive visitor experience can plant the seed for relocation, business expansion, or a decision to return home. 
A call to action 
If we are serious about tackling brain drain, we must stop seeing tourism as “just” a leisure industry, but rather a strategic tool for workforce retention, talent attraction and community revitalization. 
That means closer collaboration between tourism leaders, economic developers and  policymakers. It means aligning strategies, sharing data and recognizing that investments in tourism infrastructure like improved public spaces and preservation of historic sites are also investments in our future workforce. 
I think of my niece every time I pass a quiet river or empty downtown. She is not just one person; she is a generation we risk losing. But I have seen what tourism can do. It can turn a  quiet downtown into a bustling main street, give a young person a reason to build their life here and change how the world sees Mississippi. This transformation is real and the result of intentional efforts by community champions. 
Mississippi’s story is ours to write. At a time when we are competing globally for visitors and people, tourism may be one of our most powerful and untapped tools to write our story in a way that keeps our homegrown talent and welcomes new Mississippians.

(Photo courtesy of CDC) Since the late 1960s, researchers at Iowa State University documented and studied mosquito species, diseases and population trends in Iowa. Data for 2025 show mosquito populations have remained high this summer. 
Ryan Smith, an associate professor at ISU and director of the Iowa Mosquito Surveillance, said there are more “nuisance” mosquitoes, or the type that like to bite an exposed ankle at an evening barbecue, persisting into the beginning of fall because of the heavy rainfall Iowa saw in July.
Smith explained that of the approximately 56 types of mosquitoes in Iowa, the majority tend to be the nuisance variety that, while annoying, are not the type of mosquitoes carrying diseases like West Nile virus. These nuisance varieties, he said, are also “really influenced” by rainfall. 
 Mosquito population trends in 2024 vs 2025. May = weeks 20-22, June = 23-26, July = 27-30, August = 31-35, September = 36-39, and the beginning of October =40. (Graph courtesy of Iowa Mosquito Surveillance)
West Nile virus 
West Nile virus, which is the primary mosquito-borne disease in the country according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is carried by Colex species of mosquitoes. 
Smith said the lab at ISU has observed there are fewer Colex mosquitoes this year, but the prevalence of West Nile virus in that population is at a “really high level.” 


Symptoms of West Nile virus: 
Most infected individuals do not develop symptoms, but those that do, can develop mild symptoms like a fever, headache, stiffness or vomiting. Neck stiffness, high fever, confusion, muscle weakness or tremors can be a sign of severe illness from the virus, which can affect the central nervous system. Individuals with these symptoms should see a doctor, according to the CDC. 
In the U.S. approximately 1,200 develop severe illness and approximately 120 people die from West Nile virus annually. 


Already, Iowa has observed one case of West Nile virus this year. Iowa Department of Health and Human Services reported Aug. 14, the infected individual was in their early 40s and from northern Iowa. 
Neighboring states, like Minnesota, South Dakota and Nebraska, already have between 15 and 25 cases each, according to CDC data. 
According to Iowa HHS, 21 Iowans were diagnosed in 2024 and one death was associated with the virus.
Late August and early September is typically when the number of infected individuals peaks.
“It’s important to remind people to stay vigilant … especially outside in the evening, when these Culex mosquitoes are typically the most active,” Smith said. 
Preventive measures can include removing standing water from around a home or backyard, wearing insect repellants that contain DEET or wearing long-sleeved shirts, pants and socks when outdoors in the evenings. 
Mosquito data 
Iowa Mosquito Surveillance sends out traps to various partners, like parks and recreation staff or county public health departments, who are taught how to use the traps and then send them in to the lab, where Smith and his team analyze each trap. 
Smith said while it’s hard to compare data from year to year, based on several factors, this year has been an “above average” year compared to a 20-30 year average. 
Smith said when there are instances of heavy rainfall, or flooding in areas, it can lead to stagnant water that mosquitoes can “can take advantage of” to “really thrive and amplify their population.”

The Iowa Mosquito Surveillance does more than provide a baseline of mosquito data for the state. Smith said it also helps inform public health entities that alert the public of potential mosquito-related risks and it can help municipalities decide if they’re going to spray for mosquitoes and how to manage the spray. 
Several cities across the state spray regularly for mosquitoes, but notably, the City of Des Moines stopped its spraying program this summer to save an estimated $300,000, according to reporting from Axios. 
The City of Des Moines said the decision was made due to budget constraints. The last spray it completed was at the beginning of May when it sprayed for mosquitoes in the larval stage. 
Smith said while he’s sure the decision not to spray leads to higher populations of mosquitoes in an area, there are too many other factors impacting mosquito populations to say definitively the city’s decision had an impact on Polk County mosquito populations.

(Photo courtesy of HARI)Rhode Island is losing doctors to Massachusetts. But it has successfully poached a leader from across the border to head the state’s health care trade organization.
The Hospital Association of Rhode Island named Michael Sroczynski as its new president effective Tuesday. Sroczynski has more than two decades of experience representing hospital and health care systems throughout the region, most recently as executive vice president for the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association.
“Mike has a deep understanding of the current healthcare landscape and the multitude of challenges our local hospitals, health systems, providers, and patients are facing,” Mary Marran, president and chief operating officer of Butler Hospital and chair of the Hospital Association board of trustees. “His leadership will be immensely important as we work to build a better, even more innovative healthcare system for all Rhode Islanders.”
Sroczynski’s appointment fills the post last permanently held by Teresa Paiva Weed, a former Rhode Island Senate president, who retired in July 2024. Howard Dulude has been serving as interim association president since Paiva Weed stepped down.
Information about the search and selection process was not immediately available.
As association president, Sroczynski will lead the 17-member hospital and health care organization charged with advocating for health care services with state and federal leaders. As Rhode Island’s health care industry grapples with financial and workforce shortages and sweeping federal budget cuts, Sroczynski’s appointment comes at a “critical time of change and opportunity,” the Hospital Association said in a statement. His focus will include working with local health care facilities and provers to build their workforces and provide accessible and cost-effective care.
“Rhode Island is home to a special healthcare community with deep roots in our neighborhoods and even deeper ambitions for the future of patient care,” Sroczynski said in a statement. “I am honored to help uplift the voices of our hospitals and health systems at a time when provider voices are needed the most.”
At the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association, Sroczynski helped oversee Massachusetts’ first-in-the-nation universal health care coverage law, along with “landmark” state policies in payment structure, workforce development and care coordination and the state COVID-19 response. Prior to his job with the Massachusetts health care association, he served as legislative counsel in the Massachusetts State Senate.
Sroczynski serves on the boards of the Professional Liability Foundation and the Massachusetts chapter of the Arthritis Foundation, and is a member of the New England Council’s health care committee. 
He is a graduate of Syracuse University’s Martin J. Whitman School of Management and College of Law.
A copy of his resume was not immediately available.

Kulpsville, Pennsylvania
Died Aug. 21, 2025
Sellersville, Pennsylvania
Details of services
Bob will be laid to rest with military honors at the Vermont Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Randolph, Vermont. The interment will be conducted privately, in accordance with the family’s wishes.

Robert L. Snyder, passed away on August 21, 2025, at the age of 77 in Sellersville, Pennsylvania. He was known to most as Bob and to some he was lovingly referred to as Bobby, Dad and Grampy.
Born in Kulpsville, PA, Bob was the son of Benjamin and Maude Snyder. He grew up in Towamencin Township and graduated from North Penn High School with the Class of 1967. Shortly thereafter, Bob answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the United States Air Force in December 1967.
His distinguished military career spanned over twenty-six years, culminating in his retirement in 1993 with the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. After enlisting, Bob spent a year in Vietnam at Tan Son NHUT Air Base as part of the 377th Combat Support Group (PACAF) where he supported war efforts and the overall mission to provide the base with flying operations support, base defense, and act as an air liaison with members of the South Vietnamese Air Force. Bob also spent a required year of service doing a remote assignment away from his family in Iceland. He served with the 932d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Rockville Naval Installation, Iceland with a primary mission to monitor and detect all aircraft within the vast Icelandic air defense sector, spanning more than 250,000 square miles from the Atlantic Ocean to the North Sea. This mission was crucial during the Cold War years, particularly for early warning and airspace sovereignty against potential Soviet incursions.
After Vietnam, Bob was stationed at Hanscom AFB in Massachusetts where he met and later married Karen McCaffrey. Their union lasted from 1971-1998. Together they had one child, Nicole. Bob’s military career allowed the family to live in Okinawa as well as stateside in Montana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Colorado, Illinois and lastly Vermont where the family put down roots and transitioned from military life to civilian life. The family was afforded many wonderful memories, experiences and opportunities due to Bob’s military service. Throughout his time in the Air Force, Bob earned numerous awards, medals and commendations for his dedication, leadership, and excellence which reflected his precision, and pride in every task.
Before retiring from the Air Force, Bob’s last assignment was serving as Wing Liaison between the United States Air Force and the Vermont Civil Air Patrol, a role he was able to continue after officially retiring from the Air Force in 1993 until he left Vermont in 1998.
Bob moved back to his home state of Pennsylvania and lived in Sellersville from 1998 until his death. During this time Bob continued to work, despite being retired, as a letter carrier and then school bus driver for the Penn Ridge School District until he fully retired in 2023.
Shortly after moving back to Pennsylvania, Bob got a second chance at love and met Marie Ferretti. They shared many years together as companions until she passed away in 2022.
Bob’s interests evolved over the years, but his competitive spirit, curiosity and enthusiasm never waned. Earlier in his life he actively played in military softball leagues, was an avid bowler and pool player. He enjoyed many outdoor activities such as fishing, camping and hunting. Later in life he enjoyed solving jigsaw puzzles, card games, tracking space and weather phenomena, reading, watching anything history related and cheering on his beloved Philadelphia Phillies and Eagles.
He is survived by his daughter Nicole Adams and her husband Chris of Essex Junction, VT, and his cherished granddaughter Katie Adams of Daytona Beach, FL. Bob also leaves behind his siblings: Donald Snyder, Denny Snyder (Sherry), Wayne Snyder (Debbie), Geri Drages (John), Kathy Basciano (Mike), and Barbara Feig. He also leaves behind his brother-in-law Richard McCaffrey, sisters-in-law Joann McCaffrey and Judy McCaffrey, many nieces and nephews and former spouse Karen Snyder.
Bob’s life was enriched by the love of his neighbors, the Groeber family—Scott, Jennifer, Ashley, and Jordan—and their dog Bentley.
Bob held a deep affection for Marie Ferretti’s children—Eric Ferretti (Denise), Dana Taylor (Jeff), and Nicole Umphred (John)—along with her grandchildren Nicholas, Jake, Brooke, Luca, Nico, and Rachel, whom Bob embraced as his own.
Bob was preceded in death by his parents, Benjamin and Maude Snyder; his mother- and father-in-law, Raymond and Adelaide McCaffrey; his brother Ben Snyder; his sister-in-law Carol Snyder; his brothers-in-law John McCaffrey, Dennis McCaffrey, and Bill Feig; and his beloved companion, Marie Ferretti.
To honor Bob’s memory, the family invites you to perform an act of kindness this coming Veteran’s Day, a gesture that reflects his service to our country and his generous spirit.
Bob will be laid to rest with military honors at the Vermont Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Randolph, Vermont. The interment will be conducted privately, in accordance with the family’s wishes.

Google is the most powerful search engine in the world, commanding nearly 90% of the global search engine market and generating over $348 billion in revenue last year. Over half of Americans say they trust Google more than their formal education.
But how does Google’s algorithm decide which results show up? And how do these results influence LGBTQ kids, their parents and Americans at large who are searching for help?
Uncloseted Media asked five Americans from around the country to Google five common queries related to LGBTQ identity, religion and parenting. The results were alarming and raised an urgent question: With nearly 40% of LGBTQ youth seriously considering suicide just last year, what happens when a queer teen or the parent of a gay kid in crisis turns to Google?

“I’m Christian, my daughter is a lesbian,” Melanie Brown, a Southern Baptist from High Point, North Carolina, types into Google.
When Brown presses enter, Bible Bulletin Board comes up as the third result, with the suggestion of “offering hope for change,” and “lead[ing] the way to the alternative to homosexuality.” It goes on to explain that “homosexuality is contrary to God’s Word. It is sin and as always results in sin’s destructive effects on the individual and on those close to them.”

In the living room, Brown’s 15-year-old daughter Genna, with her dog on her lap, Googles “accurate information on gay kids and what to do.”

Focus on the Family (FOTF) is the first result. She clicks the link and lands on the platform of a hyper-religious organization known for promoting conversion therapy and labeling her sexuality as sinful.

The site, which presents itself as a reputable religious source, features a tab titled “Understanding Homosexuality” and a section under their resources for “Homosexuality.” It states: “[FOTF] is committed to upholding God’s design for the expression of human sexuality: a husband and wife in a marriage.”

It offers suggested reading on “redemption” from a gay lifestyle, along with 11 counseling resources aimed at changing sexual orientation, including The Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity, which guarantees “professional assistance … for persons who experience unwanted homosexual attractions.”
The language is intentionally padded, which means Genna and her mom—and many of the other millions of Christian parents of queer kids—may never know that Google led them to a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQ hate group. FOTF is known for its long-standing opposition to LGBTQ rights, for spreading anti-LGBTQ disinformation and for framing homosexuality and transgender identity as sinful and disordered.

In South Boston, Virginia, Tommy O’Neil Googles, “My daughter just came out as trans and I’m a Christian.” As a father of two, he wants what’s best for his kids. According to Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Google’s second result, O’Neil should recognize that God doesn’t make mistakes when assigning sex and give sympathy for those who are indoctrinated in the “transgender cult.”
What O’Neil might not know is that this seminary made the list of Worst Campuses for LGBTQ students. And in 2016, it was granted an exemption to Title IX, allowing it to discriminate against LGBTQ students for religious reasons.
Thousands of miles away in Anchorage, Alaska, 38-year-old bisexual woman April Samberg Googles, “I am bisexual and have a husband who is Christian, am I going to hell?”
The third result is once again an article by FOTF that tells April that “same-sex-attracted strugglers” and “transgender and homosexual lust and behavior are wrong.”
In Cincinnati, 44-year-old Mark Just Googles, “accurate information on homosexual kids and what to do.” FOTF is the top search result.
“I don’t feel good about it,” Just told Uncloseted Media. “It’s disturbing because if there are people out there who want to accept and understand their children or loved ones, this is what they’re being pointed to.”
“[I feel] fear for the queer kids with Christian parents who will be seeing that and thinking it’s good advice, and sorrow for the kids with parents who already have,” says Genna Brown, who was a “self-loathing, suicidal kid” who thought God would punish her for being gay before she came out to her now accepting parents. “It’s pretty awful that this is what’s being pushed for advice. This has no doubt harmed people.”
 
Uncloseted Media also asked folks in Taiwan, Lebanon, China, Hong Kong, Canada and India to Google similar queries. All of them had FOTF turn up as a top search result.
 Why Does Google Allow This?



Google, like other search engines, compiles information and directs users to various websites by referencing the titles of web pages that it judges to be most reflective of what was searched.


“Google’s algorithm is notoriously a black box,” says Jesse Ringer, founder of Method and Metric, a search engine optimization (SEO) growth company. “That’s intentional to keep their competitive advantage.”
What we do know is that Google ranks search results by first crawling the web with an automated program called “spiders” to follow links from page to page and collect data.
It uses text matching to identify documents that it thinks are relevant to a query and then ranks them based on a combination of popularity, freshness, location and previous links clicked.
But for people searching for reliable information, its process can be problematic.
“Google doesn’t rank based on accuracy, but on popularity and query matching,” says Dirk Lewandowski, professor of information research and retrieval at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. “This is based on clicks and a network of how many other links are directed to this website. … Of course, users click what is shown in the first position. So we have kind of a rich get richer.”
 How to Get a High Ranking

As websites with the highest rankings continue to receive more clicks, websites like FOTF can also employ other tactics to keep their prominent placement.
Backlinking—the process of having other web pages hyperlink back to your site—is one of the ways to maintain your high ranking.
“Backlinks are a big part of popularity. So the relationship between other websites linking to this source is a big part of Google’s algorithm,” says Ringer. “There are SEO businesses that build link farms so that the content of their clients can go higher. They create a network effect and they link to each other. It is not unreasonable to think that [FOTF] has hired either an SEO person or they’ve hired an external agency to contribute to that.”
 
According to Francesca Tripodi, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science, ranking can also be gamed by matching keywords to content. Tripodi looked at the metadata of progressive and conservative companies and found that conservative content creators “are much better at doing this.”
“They are savvy at creating new sets of words and tagging their content with them,” she says. “That’s not something I’m seeing with progressive content creators.”
Tripodi says that not only does conservatism thrive online, it might be the only perspective returned.

“They are well-funded companies with large production budgets and effective digital marketing teams,” she wrote in a 2019 testimony about conservatism and Google searches. “This is why when you search for liberal phrases like ‘gender identity’ or ‘social justice’ the top returns … are conservative content creators.”
Google declined to speak on record with Uncloseted Media for this story.
 
In an email, a spokesperson said: “Like any search engine, Google indexes the content that’s available on the open web, relying on systems like keyword matching to surface relevant results. We are largely guided by local law when it comes to removing pages from search results.”
 What If It’s Harmful or Illegal?

The United States notoriously protects harmful or misleading content—including anti-LGBTQ hate speech—under the First Amendment.
“The situation in [other countries] is a bit different than in America,” Lewandowski says. “For instance, Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany. So Google bans these sites, but they don’t ban them in the U.S.”
Section 230 of the U.S. law protects Americans’ freedom of expression online by implying that we should all be responsible for our own actions and statements on the internet. This law largely takes legal pressure off of Google.
And in 2003, an Oklahoma court ruled that Google’s rankings are subjective opinions and thus constitutionally protected.
Google’s policies for tamping down on harmful content “don’t apply to web results.” Thus, there is little moderation on the web pages that pop up for Americans who use the search engine.
The spokesperson for Google says that “[they] hold themselves to a high standard when it comes to legal requirements to remove pages from Google search results” and that “they don’t remove web results except for child sexual abuse, highly personal information, spam, site owner requests, and valid legal requests.”
But according to the company, “determining whether content is illegal is not always a determination that Google is equipped to make.”
Tripodi says this might be why groups like FOTF are still showing up, even though conversion therapy is illegal in 23 states. She says these groups may have found a loophole in Google’s policy by “tricking” the search engine into thinking they are providing “resources” and not simply a recommendation for conversion therapy.





 What Can Google Do to Fix This?

“Google has a responsibility for what is coming up in their results because people trust [them],” says Lewandowski. “They think something is correct or accurate because it is number one in Google.”
Fifteen-year-old Genna Brown is one of the 85% of Americans who feel this way, according to a 2025 study.
“Isn’t the first result typically ranked most credible?” she says. “Because I typically trust the first result more.”
“It’s pretty concerning what comes up when you search for these things,” Ringer says. “There needs to be more done to educate the people who are doing the searches on understanding news and information.”
 
But vulnerable groups, like LGBTQ kids who are living in households where they are told they are going to hell and parents who are often confused and in crisis themselves, are being led by Google’s algorithm to believe that being queer is wrong.
“1000% yes, these results concern me,” says Genna Brown. “We’re talking about organizations that promote practices like conversion therapy, which is insane. … I wish there was some disclaimer. Like, ‘Google has determined this to be a subjective query. As such, we can’t verify the following results. Proceed with caution.’”
Tripodi says she thinks consumers are responsible for about 20% of the burden by researching and verifying the sources they learn from. But she agrees with Brown in that Google carries an ethical responsibility for the content it chooses to rank and promote.
“As a global corporation that gobbles up all other possibilities for information, Google has a responsibility to ensure that its content is accurate and not harmful,” Tripodi says. “[It’s their job] to ensure that the information that they surface is accurate and reliable because we know people trust that information.”

A private celebration of life will be held on Sunday, August 31, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. at his home on Lake Champlain.

Dr. Mark Eric Kruger, 80, of Beach Road in Colchester, passed peacefully in the early hours of Thursday, August 21, 2025, at McClure Miller Respite Home, following a long and courageous journey with health challenges.
Born on March 16, 1945, in Winooski, Vermont, he was the son of Karl and Claire (Gravel) Kruger. He graduated from Rice Memorial High School in 1963 and went on to live a life marked by service, scholarship, and devotion to family.
From 1968–1971, Eric proudly served his country as a Navigator in the United States Navy aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier. Following his service, he pursued his passion for education, earning a master’s degree in Special Education from Columbia University and later an Ed.D. in Special Education from Lehigh University.
Eric began his career as a special education teacher, where his compassion and commitment touched the lives of countless students. He later became a professor of Special Education at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, where he mentored future educators with the same dedication that defined his life’s work. Upon retirement, he returned to Vermont and cherished his days on Lake Champlain, where he found peace in the slower rhythm of the water and the company of those he loved.
A highlight of his academic career came when he was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship, which brought him to India as a Fulbright Professor. There, he shared his expertise in special education, helping to strengthen programs and support for children with disabilities, leaving a lasting impact that extended far beyond his home country.
He is survived by his children Kristin and her wife Luanne, Michael and his wife Stephanie, and Julie and her husband Henry; his beloved grandchildren Charlotte, Owen, and Gavin; his brothers Karl (Chip) and wife Anne, Steve and wife Carol, and Mike and wife Lynne; his sisters Kathy (Foff) and Anne and husband Dave, and numerous nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his wife Monica and eldest son Stephen. He is also survived by his loving companion, Pat, with whom he shared several meaningful years.

President Trump broke that law by sending the National Guard to L.A., a federal judge rules.","In summary
A 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act defines what the military can do on U.S. soil. President Trump broke that law by sending the National Guard to L.A., a federal judge rules.


President Donald Trump’s deployment of the military to Los Angeles violated federal laws and  his use of the armed forces must be heavily curtailed in California, a federal judge ruled today in a 52-page opinion that inveighed against the president’s belief that he has unchecked powers to send the military into U.S. cities.
“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Charles Breyer, the judge overseeing the trial. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”
The judge blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the Trump administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions, Breyer wrote. But his own order won’t go into effect until Sept. 12.
Breyer’s ruling caps one phase of the legal saga over Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles. It followed a three-day trial in August that featured about 10 hours of testimony from military personnel, cross-examinations and arguments from lawyers representing California and the federal government.
His order colors an increasingly tense legal environment nationally after Trump deployed National Guardsmen to Washington, D.C. — aided by several Republican governors — and has threatened to send troops to Oakland as well as Chicago and New York. 
Breyer’s decision follows closely the arguments California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s legal team made. They contended that the 700 U.S. Marines and 4,000 National Guardsmen that the Trump administration deployed to Southern California violated a 19th century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. It prohibits the military from engaging in law enforcement activity.Bonta stressed that point when asked about the case at a recent press conference. “There was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, that the military was improperly on the ground in L.A., involved in civilian law enforcement, contrary to what the (Posse Comitatus Act) provides,” Bonta said. “They were involved in blockades and perimeter support and traffic enforcement and immigration enforcement.”Fewer than 300 National Guard troops remain in Los Angeles, though the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5. Trump deployed the military after protests in Los Angeles broke out against federal immigration sweeps.
California’s lawyers argued that by assisting federal immigration agents, the National Guard performed the law enforcement duties that federal statute — and Department of Defense guidance — prohibit. That guidance said armed forces cannot do the following: “Evidence collection; security functions; crowd and traffic control; and operating, manning, or staffing checkpoints.” California lawyers pointed to that language in their legal briefs.Federal Department of Justice attorneys contended that those actions don’t count as law enforcement. They also said California was wrong to sue over the Posse Comitatus Act in a civil court because that act is a criminal statute, not civil.
Military as a ‘national police force’
California lawyers also said in their briefs that the use of the National Guard in Los Angeles meant that soldiers could accompany any number of federal agencies enforcing the nation’s laws, such as food inspectors, medical fraud investigators or federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places.
Breyer seemed persuaded by that argument. He wrote in his ruling that if the government’s rationale is that the military can assist law enforcement whenever there’s danger to officers, there’s no logical end to the military’s involvement, since law enforcement is inherently dangerous.
Breyer’s ruling echoed his questioning during the third day of the trial about the limits of military involvement. “So again, I go back to the thing that I’m really troubled by: Is what limiting factors are there to the use of this force” once the incident that required the troops’ presence is quelled, Breyer asked a federal attorney during last week’s trial. “How does one look at this national police force which goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws.” 
How often National Guard joined immigration agents
California lawyers showed during the trial that National Guard soldiers took part in over 60 operations with federal immigration law enforcement forces. The National Guard accompanied immigration law enforcement agents on roughly 75% of the agents’ missions between June and early July, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director for Los Angeles testified. Guardsmen set up armed perimeters that blocked traffic and people, the lawyers said, and apprehended at least one protester.The troops also took part in a mission at MacArthur Park, a Los Angeles public park, that a government memo presented during the trial described as “demonstrating federal reach and presence.” 
The National Guardsmen arrived with Humvees and tactical vehicles. Other evidence from federal documents that California attorneys displayed showed that “current intelligence does not indicate a high value target or threat to federal functions at this location” and that there was “no indication that failure to act would result in a loss of life or significant property damage.” 
Is the National Guard subject to Posse Comitatus?
Another major question in the trial was whether the National Guard is covered by the Posse Comitatus Act even when the president uses an obscure law federalizing the troops.It is, Breyer wrote. “The Court will not take Defendants’ invitation to create a brand-new exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that nullifies the Act itself.”The federal government has argued that the National Guard isn’t bound by Posse Comitatus and can in fact execute the nation’s laws due to another law that permits the president to call up the National Guard in emergencies. That was a claim Breyer responded to skeptically during the trial.
“Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide and regulation after regulation and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act. If that Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant, why did that happen?” Breyer asked the federal government attorney during the trial.
“If the President wants to avoid the act’s restrictions, he must invoke a valid exception — like the Insurrection Act, along with its requisite showing that state and local law enforcement are unable or unwilling to act,” Breyer wrote.
A California lawyer, Meghan Strong, an attorney representing California, pointed to a June 16 Department of Defense action memo that she described as showing that using the National Guard to enforce laws “would be inconsistent with the Posse Comitatus Act.” That view was reaffirmed by William Harrington, the deputy chief of staff of Task Force 51, which is the military unit deployed to Los Angeles.“You said that if any National Guard troops were federalized as part of the deployment, they would lose the ability to conduct law enforcement activities, because of the Posse Comitatus Act,” Strong said to Harrington at the trial last Monday.“Correct,” Harrington replied. 
Lawyers for California said during the trial that the National Guard can still play a role in emergencies as long as it’s not law-enforcement in nature. Those include guarding federal buildings or even delivering the mail, as the National Guard did during the Nixon administration in 1970 while postal workers were on strike.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA-TS-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-02 12:00:11.154102

Springfield, Vermont
Died Aug. 23, 2025
Arcadia, California
Details of services
A memorial service in Peter’s honor held at 10:30 a.m., Friday, September 5, 2025 at San Marino Community Church, 1750 Virginia Road, San Marino, California.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Peter’s name to Johnny’s school, Westmoreland Academy, a leader in special education in Southern California, with a unique program for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Grounded in the belief that extraordinary students deserve an extraordinary program, Westmoreland Academy is essential to Johnny’s success.

Peter Hugh Sinclair(1975 – 2025)
Beloved husband, father, brother, and friend, Peter Sinclair passed away on August 23rd following a short but fierce battle with cancer. He was surrounded and embraced by his loving wife Kate, daughter Mary, son Johnny, sister Molly, and family, who supported him with courage and resilience through his illness.
Peter and Kate Sinclair met in Boston in 2004, and they were inseparable from the day they met. They shared a mutual sense of humor, a love of hiking, and passion for their sports teams, including the Dodgers and Red Sox. Their love only grew stronger through years of triumphs and challenges in the life that they built together. Anyone could see they were made for each other. Peter only had eyes for Kate— she was his sunshine.
Residents of San Marino, CA for the past 14 years, Peter is known in his community as “softball Dad.” Afternoons and weekends, he could be found on the practice field with Mary. Peter built a batting cage in their backyard, where they practiced early mornings and after dinner. Kate, Peter, and Mary explored remote towns of Southern California and beyond on weekends for away games, often leaving before dawn and returning after dark. Peter couldn’t have been prouder when Mary recently committed to play softball at Brown University, Class of 2030.
Peter was equally devoted to his son Johnny. Together with Kate, they helped Johnny navigate living with Autism. Although Johnny is non-verbal, Peter and Kate have learned to communicate with him in many other ways. The entire family often hiked and explored the hills of Malibu and mountains of La Cañada. On summer trips to Bass Lake, Peter and Johnny raced around the lake tubing and jet skiing. Through countless adventures together, from Death Valley to Mount Baldy, Big Bear, and Utah, Peter would often say that Johnny taught him more than anything he learned in the classroom.
Not only did the Sinclair’s form a great team, Peter was a role model for all the children in his life. Known by his nephew Jack and nieces Kate and Maddie as the “fun adult,” Peter always sat at the kids’ table at family dinners. Peter was an avid fan in the stands at Little League games, always cheering for the kids, both on and off the field.
Born in Springfield, Vermont, Peter loved the outdoors. The 1993 Vermont State Boys Alpine Champion, Peter also played soccer in high school and college. Peter was a student of all things, a curious and lifelong learner. He graduated from Williams College magna cum laude with a double major in philosophy and chemistry. Peter taught English in Tokyo and interned at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. A Harvard Law School graduate, he began his career in Boston at McKinsey & Co. Although friends, classmates, and co-workers referred to Peter as “the most intelligent of all of us,” Peter lived his life with humility, focused on friends and family.
During his career, Peter became a brilliant entrepreneur. He held leadership roles in companies that spanned pomegranate juice, flowers, event tickets, financial services, and ultimately, music. He left his executive role at Universal Music in Los Angeles to follow his dream and build a company to fund the dreams of artists and musicians. Peter co-founded beatBread in 2020 to empower artists to make a living from their music without giving up ownership of their work. As CEO of beatBread, Peter and his team have helped artists pave their way, with financial advances to give them freedom to do what they do best – create. In a recent article, Peter said, “What music can do – nothing else can. Other than comedy, I believe music is maybe the only medium that can really change someone’s mind about an important issue. This is something I’d be proud to tell my parents that I’m doing with my life. beatBread fits that bill for me. The team at beatBread are all trying to accomplish something beyond building a business… we’re all doing our best to make a positive dent in the world, where more musicians have more choice to make music on their own terms.”  
Peter made a positive dent in this world, and his impact is felt most profoundly by his family, who will miss him dearly. Peter is survived by his wife of 19 years, Kate Zaia Sinclair; daughter Mary Elizabeth Sinclair; son John Zaia Sinclair; sister Molly Sinclair and wife Rachel Piper; brother Jes Sinclair; mother-in-law Connie Zaia; sister-in-law Sarah Rome and husband Jason Rome; sister-in-law Brita Elise Zaia and partner Monica Rosa; nephew Jack Rome; nieces Kate and Madeline Rome. Peter is pre-deceased by his parents, John and Nancy Sinclair and father-in-law, John Zaia.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Olga still tears up when she recalls witnessing New Orleanians returning to the city in the months after Hurricane Katrina struck — only to find their homes destroyed.
“It made me sad to see other people suffer like that. … They were coming home and hoping that maybe they’d find some pieces of what they left behind and there would be nothing – nothing,” said Olga, a 63-year-old construction worker originally from Veracruz, Mexico, speaking through a translator earlier this month. “I think that vicarious trauma affected me a lot. … I did all I could to try to help those people.”
Olga — an undocumented immigrant who asked that her full name not be published — arrived in New Orleans in January 2006 hoping to find work. There was plenty to be found. Katrina had hit New Orleans just a few months earlier. The failure of the flood protection system that followed left 80 percent of the city underwater; entire neighborhoods were in ruins.
In the months after she arrived, Olga found jobs clearing out rotting furniture, deceased pets and damaged memories from people’s homes. She also worked on demolitions.
As crews began to rebuild, she excelled in installing wallboard and later in welding fences, she said.

Olga is one of thousands of workers from Central America and Mexico who came to the New Orleans metro region to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina’s destruction.
The influx of Latinx workers to New Orleans has largely been viewed as a net positive. Many residents say the reconstruction workers helped make it possible for them to return to their homes and get back their lives after the storm took so much away.
Hispanic residents represent one area of growth in an otherwise shrinking region. In the past two decades, the Hispanic population in the metro area grew by about 80,000 — going from 5% of the area population in 2000 to about 14% as of last year — adding to the local labor force, boosting local entrepreneurship and contributing to local tax revenues.
But the stability that many longtime undocumented residents and recently arrived immigrants have sought in Louisiana is now being threatened as the Trump administration, along with state and local authorities, cracks down on immigration.
New state laws and federal policies have increased information-sharing between the state and immigration enforcement agencies. Immigrants have been taken into federal custody and swiftly deported after showing up for routine ICE check-in appointments. ICE has conducted major worksite raids in New Orleans and Calcasieu Parish. And nearly two dozen local and state law enforcement agencies have inked partnership agreements with ICE, deputizing local officers to do the federal agency’s work.
Olga said the threat of detention and deportation feels “omnipresent” now.
“I think the greatest fear I’ve ever felt is this year,” Olga said. “You leave for work in the morning and you have no idea if you’re ever going to make it home.”

‘Leaving our families behind and risking our lives’
Reconstruction workers had different reasons to come to New Orleans after Katrina. For Olga, it was money. Her husband had walked out on her, and she had three kids to feed. So she took the journey to Texas, traveling by bus and foot to the U.S. border, then crossing the Rio Grande in a raft. Olga left behind two daughters, a son and her parents, planning to send money back to them in Mexico.
Once she crossed into Texas, near McAllen, she said, she had to hide from immigration authorities in a ditch. She then headed northeast on foot, walking for eight hours. She then put her trust in smugglers, known as “coyotes,” to get her to a safe place to stay. She rested there for a month before making her way to Louisiana.
Her first Louisiana home was in Hammond, about an hour outside New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. She shared the house, which lacked electricity, with a group of roughly 20 other workers – mostly men.
After 10- to-12-hour days working in construction, she and the only other woman living in the house were expected to cook for the crew. This is how it went for years, she said, moving from house to house with different crews. Now, Olga lives in Jefferson Parish – which has seen the largest growth in the region’s Latinx population in recent decades. She lives with her son, who joined her in the U.S. in 2014 and works alongside her on construction jobs, and her grandson.
Leticia Casildo, who came to New Orleans from Honduras in November 2005, came here seeking safety.
Back home, she worked as a police officer. In an interview Tuesday, Casildo said she was threatened after she reported corruption within the force. She and her husband fled, leaving behind their 2-year old daughter and 5-year old son in hopes that they would be able to send for them soon after. It would be eight years before they were reunited. By then Casildo and her husband were also raising their third child, a U.S. citizen.
Both Olga and Casildo cried when reminded of how their families were broken apart in their quests for stability in the U.S.
“My husband and I worked hard because we kept thinking, ‘I need my children. I need my children with me,’ all the time,” Casildo said.
Because of her status, Olga has never left the U.S. since crossing the border 20 years ago.. When her father died in 2009, she could not return home.
“[People] see us working, but a lot of people have no idea the suffering immigrants go through day in and day out,” Olga said. “We all have lived that same situation of leaving our families behind and risking our lives.”
Building community
The rebuilding work could be risky. To aid in rebuilding quickly, the Bush administration in September 2005 briefly suspended federal worksite inspection and enforcements in storm-affected areas.
Even though the regulations were quickly put back in place, the suspension of the laws had already “paved the way for exploitation of workers,” said Sarah Fouts, a University of Maryland, Baltimore County professor who provided support to workers in the 2010s as a volunteer with El Congreso de Jornaleros, or Congress of Day Laborers, a program of the now-splintered New Orleans Worker’s Center for Racial Justice.
Fouts’ recently published book, “Rebuilding New Orleans: Immigrant Laborers and Street Food Vendors In The Post-Katrina Era,” notes the “toxic conditions” and lack of protections for thousands of Central American and Mexican workers reconstructing the region.
“As day laborers worked relentlessly, they fell victim time and again to an unregulated job market, receiving little to no compensation or protections,” Fouts writes.
Olga said on multiple occasions, she and a crew she was working with would finish a job, only to be told that the homeowner refused to pay for the work.
In 2009, the Times-Picayune reported that El Congreso de Jornaleros and the Workers’ Center filed complaints against contractors and subcontractors for shorting laborers on pay.
Wage theft for immigrant construction workers in the United States persists as the threat of climate disasters intensifies – with reports of lost wages from laborers who helped rebuild after Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricane Ida in 2021.

Responding to challenges that the region’s immigrant community was facing, Casildo founded the nonprofit Familias Unidas en Accíon, or Families United in Action, in 2018. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization delivered food to undocumented immigrants who did not qualify for benefits. Familias Unidas has grown to operate other programs, including addressing labor rights issues.
Despite these challenges of poor living and working conditions and fighting for proper compensation, Olga said she never considered leaving New Orleans. She was determined to create opportunities for her family in Mexico. She said her work has paid for her children’s education. Her eldest daughter is now a biologist. Her other daughter is a sommelier, and her son earned a law degree before joining his mother in the U.S. She also paid for a house in Mexico, where her daughter and grandchildren live.
Others have become entrepreneurs.
In “Rebuilding New Orleans,” Fouts, who researches foodways, writes that food trucks, called loncheras, sprung up near popular day-laborer corners during the post-Katrina reconstruction era because workers needed affordable, familiar foods to fuel their long work days. Now, she said, it’s easy to see the impact that Hispanic immigrants have had on the New Orleans metro region by following the food.
“Maybe the people aren’t that visible, but the restaurants are so visible,” Fouts said.
In Mid-City, Fouts noted, food trucks selling Mexican tacos and Salvadoran pupusas line Broad Street, sitting near restaurants offering typical Honduran cuisine and three supermarkets serving Latinx customers – Norma’s Bakery on Bienville Street, La Morenita on Canal Street and Ideal Supermarket on Broad Street.
“If you have three Latin American grocery stores within a half a mile radius, that’s super visible,” Fouts said.
‘Your parents were heroes’
A few years after Hurricane Katrina, Dr. Juan Gershanik, who is originally from Argentina,  looked around New Orleans and noticed that — in a city filled with monuments to the past — there was little public recognition of the Latinx workers’ contributions to the post-Katrina recovery.
Gershanik is a pediatrician, not a construction worker, but he had made his own notable contribution to the city in the wake of the storm.
As the floodwaters rose, he worked with a team of people at Memorial Medical Center, now Ochsner Baptist, to safely transfer some of its most vulnerable patients – newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit being kept alive inside incubators –  to Baton Rouge. The team transported the incubators to a helipad on the hospital’s roof. Inside a supply helicopter, Gershanik helped the newborns to breathe by manually pumping oxygen from a portable tank. With the most vulnerable baby needing warmth, Gershanik placed the tiny child on his stomach – earning him the nickname “the Argentinian Kangaroo.”
In the years after Katrina when he and his wife, Ana, a journalist, began speaking with Hispanic students in a drug and alcohol awareness program, they noticed that the children of migrant recovery laborers appeared “ashamed” of their parents’ work, he said in a recent interview.
“I say, ‘What does your family do?’ And they start getting down in the face,” Gershanik said. “They were so, in a sense, ashamed that their parents were in what they called menial [jobs].”
“My husband and I said to them … ‘Without your parents, we would not have been able to go back to New Orleans,’” Ana Gershanik said. “Your parents were heroes.”
They decided then that there needed to be a physical monument honoring the Latin Americans that helped rebuild New Orleans.
“I wanted these children to be proud – to help their self-esteem,” Juan Gershanik said.
The Gershaniks and their three children worked on the effort to bring the statue to life. They found an Italian sculptor, Franco Alessandrini, to build it.
Juan Gershanik wanted the sculpture to include a roof and ladder – things that pointed to the work that was done. Ana Gershanik worked to ensure that the people in the finished piece did not have European features, but instead were representative of the Central Americans and Mexicans that worked in New Orleans. And she said, there had to be women there because she remembered seeing women working alongside men on dusty construction sites.
“There were women everywhere,” Ana Gershanik said.
In November 2018, the monument was unveiled inside Crescent Park, which runs along the Mississippi River, stretching from the Marigny neighborhood at the edge of the French Quarter to Bywater. The 26,000-pound sculpture featured workers – a man on a ladder, another on the roof of a house, a woman holding a broom.
After providing these contributions to New Orleans, immigrant workers “deserve the same treatment as anybody else who lives in this country,” Ana Gershanik said. She said that despite the threat of immigration detention and deportation, she believes recovery workers will continue to show up for U.S. communities after natural disasters.
Olga said she knows that she has made a positive impact on hundreds of people whose homes she’s worked on in the past two decades. She said of course she and other laborers deserve recognition, and they also deserve to live without fear.
“Don’t treat us as criminals. We are essential workers. We are hardworking people. We try and help the community rebuild, develop and flourish,” Olga said. “We’ve been here for you through all of this. … Help us to at least be able to live with certitude that will be able to make it home safely without being hunted down.”

Criminal defense lawyers say that’s because the state is intentionally deprioritizing much-needed changes, citing the lack of legislative action, as well as the underfunding of the public defender system, and an appeal filed by the state earlier this year seeking to block the temporary release of indigent defendants until they are provided legal representation.
Of the more than 35 bills related to indigent defense that the Legislature considered this session, only five became law. Gov. Janet Mills signed two of the bills while three more became law without her signature. Four additional bills were enacted by the Legislature but held by Mills to either veto within the first three days of the next session in January or let them become law without her signature. 
The governor vetoed one bill that aimed to clarify when an indigent defendant is entitled to counsel at the state’s expense. The laws that did pass, for the most part, did not enact any sweeping changes to the criminal justice system, three experts told the Maine Morning Star.
Meanwhile, there are still almost 300 people without attorneys as of August 27, almost 45 of whom are currently in jail, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of court data.
“Overall, I would say it was a disappointing session. I understand, in light of the budget constraints everybody was under, that they felt they were limited in what they could do,” said Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services.
“But what left an especially sour taste in our mouths after the session concluded was that there was $150 million left over that they had not calculated correctly,” he added, referring to the $152 million surplus that Maine ended with at the close of the fiscal year on June 30, “and despite having a civil rights lawsuit still pending and a court order saying we’re violating the U.S. Constitution, we received very little in the way of new resources.”
Billings announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post in October.
Some defense attorneys argued that Mills is partly the reason for the Legislature’s lack of progress and funding for the public defense system.
“We have a governor who, through her cohorts, has made it very clear that they are not going to support any real, true criminal legal reform. We have a Legislature that has not been able to address this issue, or will not address this issue,” said Tina Nadeau, executive director of the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So anything that could have a wide impact on the people that we serve … has not had any positive reception.”
Mills’ office denied this claim, touting the recent establishment of the state’s first public defender offices and increasing the commission budget from approximately $20 million to $45 million per year. In 2023, Mills also signed into law a raise for private attorneys that the commission contracts with from $80 to $150.
“Despite having significantly more money, the number of rostered attorneys has not increased to required levels, and the system continues to struggle to find lawyers to represent indigent defendants,” Mills’ spokesperson Ben Goodman said.
Insufficient funding persists
However, Maine’s public defender offices are new and the 33 employed public defenders can’t take on all the indigent defendants’ cases, so the bulk of cases are still contracted out to private criminal defense lawyers. There are between 35 and 50 rostered attorneys out of a list of 300 that take on a majority of cases, with others working for the commission part-time. Those lawyers charged about 325,000 total billable hours last year, which Billings said amounted to about $48 million — exceeding the annual budget allocated to the commission.
“They’re not facing the reality that for a time period, we’re going to be paying for two systems, so it’s costing us over $56 million this year for a partial public defender system,” he said. “It’s going to take some patience and some amount of time for the public defenders to start absorbing the billable hours that were all going to the rostered attorneys before we start to see some savings.”
Because of those costs, the commission will have no funds left to keep paying rostered attorneys for the last quarter of the fiscal year, starting April 2026, unless the Legislature approves an additional $13 million before then, Billings said. 
Those lawyers, which include Nadeau and Jim Howaniec, a longtime criminal defense lawyer and former mayor of Lewiston, are expecting major disruptions. 
“The rubber is going to hit the road come April 1, when people are still going to get arrested, but the criminal defense lawyers aren’t going to be paid,” Howaniec said.
Lawmakers on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee were caught between two competing realities this session, said co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland): “The need for [Public Defense Services] to have additional funding and the lack of a surplus of resources for the Legislature to appropriate.”
Both Nadeau and Howaniec pointed out that the state also has $1.03 billion in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also called the “rainy day fund,” which could be tapped for short-term relief. 
“The state of Maine has been sued for violating the Sixth Amendment. Is it not raining yet?” Nadeau asked.
Asked about the commission’s pending budget shortfall, the governor’s spokesperson said she would evaluate its budget and “work with the Legislature in the next legislative session to consider what needs may be reasonable —- and what the Commission itself can do — to continue to address this issue.”
“In the meantime, the Governor has said publicly that lawyers who represent indigent defendants should be confident they will be fully paid for their work,” Goodman added.
Goodman also cited Maine Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy’s March 2025 order that said the public defender offices are not taking on enough cases despite being staffed. He also pointed to the governor’s suggestion that the commission remove limits on the number of cases that private contracted lawyers could take on.










We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.


– Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services


However, Billings said in March there were only five public defenders responsible for training and taking on cases, and 1,000 defendants waiting for counsel. At that time, the offices were not fully operational with many positions still vacant, and there were many entry level and out-of-state attorneys with no Maine experience. 
“The state of Maine has simply not dedicated the necessary resources to solve this problem, and it cannot be fixed on the backs of five people,” he said. “We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.”
Legislative progress
One of the bills that became law without the governor’s signature this session, LD 1101 sponsored by Carney, funded eight new positions within the commission, five assistant defenders and three support staff. Carney said she hopes the law can support public defenders to take on cases that might be hard to find contracted defense lawyers for.
Michael Kebede, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said it was “very good” that the Legislature was able to fund this bill “in a legislative session where funding was very scarce.” 
“These positions are primarily responsible for providing indigent legal services to criminal defendants and parties in child protective proceedings, and that’s essentially the source of the crisis,” Kebede said. “There aren’t enough such people, and so this bill just creates more of the jobs that we need to solve the indigent defense crisis.”
Billings, however, said while the law created the new positions, they were not ones that the commission had requested. He also criticized the provision allowing the judicial branch to appoint attorneys not vetted or supervised by the commission, which he said was a step backward.
Broader reforms lacking
Even with adequate funding, the lack of broader reforms to the criminal justice system, which would decrease the number of people requiring legal defense, remains an issue. Hundreds of defendants who can’t afford attorneys are still facing the consequences of a harsh criminal code, Nadeau and Howaniec said.
“The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they’re economic, they’re political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system,” Howaniec said. 










The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they're economic, they're political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system.


– Jim Howaniec, criminal defense attorney


Carney said lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee shared this concern. “We are prosecuting things as crimes that shouldn’t be crimes under Maine’s criminal code, and by doing so, we’re unduly burdening both the judicial system and also the defense services,” she said.
But most of the reforms that would change the criminal code were either rejected by the committee, or were carried over to the next session. 
Some of those include bills ensuring access to speedy trials for defendants, allowing people to be released on parole, decriminalizing small amounts of drug possession, limiting how many years younger people can be sentenced, diversifying the jury pool and getting rid of charges filed against someone out on bail who violates their conditions of release — Maine’s most common criminal charge.
That bill, LD 179 introduced by Rep. David Sinclair, an attorney from Bath, would have removed the crime of violating conditions of release. Maine is one of only six states with such a charge that serves as a separate class E crime, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
In 2024 alone, there were over 5,400 such charges filed in Maine courts, Frayla Tarpinian, a former prosecutor who oversees Maine’s first public defender office, said in a statement to the committee. In comparison, she said the second most common type of charge was 662 cases of drug possession.
Sinclair told Maine Morning Star in February that he believed removing the separate charge for violating conditions or release would help alleviate the state’s indigent defense system. 
However, that bill was ultimately opposed by the committee. Carney said while some agreed with the principles underlying the proposal, arguments that such a charge is an important tool for protecting survivors of domestic violence ultimately swayed their vote.
A related bill, which was one of the only ones signed into law this year, allows prosecutors to determine whether to reduce certain class E crimes to civil violations.
Maine is far from alone in struggling to pass broader reforms, said Abbe Smith, a law professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic at Georgetown University. 
“Everybody wants to be known as tough on crime, concerned about public safety, and I think opposition to commonsense reforms often plays on that fear of crime,” said Smith.
She added, “criminal defendants have no constituency. Nobody really cares about the quality of representation, except some lawyers and those who find themselves in the system.”
TIMELINE 
Indigent defense crisis in courts
Over the past few years, Maine’s indigent defense crisis has not substantially improved, with hundreds of people sitting in jail without attorneys over the years, Nadeau and Howaniec said. 
This January, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled the state’s failure to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney a constitutional crisis, and in March said the state must create a plan to address it.
Murphy, the judge, also agreed to consider releasing indigent defendants who have been jailed without legal counsel for at least 14 days, and to temporarily dismiss charges against defendants without representation for more than 60 days after their initial court appearance.
But the state appealed that decision and hearings on individual cases that could have started in June were paused until October when the case will go before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. As a result, no defendants were released or had their charges temporarily dismissed, according to the ACLU. 
“It’s such a problem that the brakes have been completely pumped on the most fundamental remedy for this ongoing crisis of people not having representation,” Nadeau said. “The real violation, from the state’s perspective, is these folks would be getting away with something, and how dare they. Because the state doesn’t think the people who are without counsel deserve a remedy.”
Next steps
Several other reforms will be considered when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
These include LD 1941, which would reestablish parole, and LD 449, which proposes conditional discharge for certain defendants. 
Carney said she doesn’t know whether it is possible to make the changes proposed in LD 449 to the state criminal code, although it is “trying to get at that same concern that we’re spending more resources charging and prosecuting people than we need to spend in order to achieve the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal code.”
Another carried over bill that Carney said could improve judicial efficiency is LD 340, which would establish different time limits for criminal trials. However, both Nadeau and the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers oppose the legislation because they say it is not adequate.
Another bill that could get taken up again next session is LD 338, which would expand jury pool diversity. That legislation was passed by both chambers but is being held by the governor. 
Howaniec said the lack of diversity in juries increases the inequity of Maine’s judicial system.
“There’s obviously a disproportionately larger number of minorities charged with crimes because there’s a correlation between poverty and crime,” Howaniec said. 
Carney agreed that the underlying policy is important and said it may be worth looking into how current jury pools are determined.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)It’s not just Republicans in Congress who are being aggressively challenged at town-hall meetings this summer.
Pinellas County state Rep. Berny Jacques heard loudly from some critics about the way Florida Republicans are running the state while hosting a town hall meeting at the Abundant Life Ministries in Largo last Friday night.
While touting DOGE efforts led by Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia to review spending by local governments, Jacques was interrupted by a man who began shouting about “home rule.”
“You’re talking about giving over our finances and giving up control to the state government and having their Big Brother eyes scrutinizing these cities, whether it’s big cities or small cities. Like, what about the city’s own ability to judge for themselves? ” the man yelled at Jacques. “You’re taking away everybody’s power to hold their own electeds responsible if they so choose.”
“I would push back against your dismissiveness of the state’s role in all of this,” Jacques responded. “And I believe in home rule as much as the next guy, but when government is intentionally or blatantly wasting your money, and people don’t have recourse —”
The man angrily retorted: “Wasting your money? $300 million on Alligator Alcatraz!” He referred to the costs of the immigrant detention facility built by the state in the Everglades. (Court filings in a federal lawsuit brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida say that the state has spent at least $218 million in constructing the facility).
“There should be no resistance to being transparent,” Jacques responded, his voice rising. “Anybody who is resistant to be transparent has something to hide, and they need to be brought to heel!” Other members of the crowd cheered him on.
“Like the Hope [Florida] Foundation, right?” Another voice in the audience immediately called out.
Another inquiry about the costs of constructing Alligator Alcatraz prompted Jacques to say that the state and the country gave President Trump the green light to enact his promise of mass deportations of immigrants without legal papers when they reelected him to the White House last year.
“He has to deliver on that mandate,” he said. “Anything less would be a disappointment, and I’m so glad that the president is amping it up, and I’m so glad that our state government is being a strong partner in amping up the deportations because it’s what the people demanded.”
Congressional redistricting
The next issue was congressional redistricting. Gov. Ron DeSantis has said it’s likely the Legislature will follow Texas in redrawing the state’s congressional districts map before the 2026 election.
The woman asking the question prefaced it by denouncing the 2022 congressional map drawn up by Gov. Ron DeSantis that eliminated a majority-Black district in North Florida (that was recently upheld by the Florida Supreme Court).
She also criticized the 2022 state Senate-approved map that a federal judicial panel upheld within the past month. She went on to describe the call by Trump for Republican lawmakers to redraw their congressional lines was a way to “silence the voices of millions of Floridians.”
“Do you intend to support this obvious gerrymandered and partisan redistricting?” she asked Jacques.
“I will support our redistricting if they get the numbers accurately,” he replied, adding that he believes Florida was undercounted in the 2020 U.S. Census and robbed of one or two congressional seats. “So, there should be a new Census,” he said. “There should be a citizenship question. We should know who’s here, and we should redistrict accordingly in a way that’s accurate with the current times.”
A few minutes later a woman stood up and chastised Jacques and the crowd for displaying what she called un-Christian behavior. She then criticized law enforcement officers arresting and detaining people who they claim lack the legal right to be here without due process.
“You have to prove that. Instead of allowing funds to be diverted to federal initiatives, we are investing in concentration camps in the United States,” she said. “Now, the Germans said the Jews were criminals and they were taking away from our —”
An uproar from the crowd ensued, drowning out the remainder of her sentence.
“Before we go to the next person, just to be clear, I disagree with everything she just said,” Jacques responded, as an official with the church intervened to try to keep the peace. At that point, the man who who initially shouted out to Jacques yelled back at the church official. Members of the crowd yelled, “We don’t want to hear you,” and he peaceably left the event.
The crowd settled down after that.
The Pinellas Republican was later asked about SB 180, the measure sponsored by fellow GOP Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie designed to expedite post-disaster rebuilding. There’s been a substantial backlash from local government officials since it went into effect. They object to a provision that prevents local governments from passing any new local land-use or development regulations that could be considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books.
“We vote on hundreds of bills. And every now and then, probably more times than we care to admit, we have some unintended consequences. And then you have to go back and adjust,” Jacques responded. “That is an issue I’m looking into, because I’ve been hearing from several people who are involved in local government and we don’t want to be overdeveloped.”
Property taxes
Another inquiry from a woman who identified herself as a member of the Pinellas Republican Liberty Caucus was about the (still to be written) constitutional amendment expected to be on the ballot next year aimed at either eliminating or reducing property taxes on homesteads. If approved, she asked, would that mean that the tax burdens would simply just shift into higher sales taxes, more tolls, or higher fees at state parks?
“It will depend on the particular city,” Jacques said. “Even if all homestead property taxes went away, they could still make it up on second homes, they could still make it up on commercial properties.”
He added that the idea that local governments could lose some of their funding via property taxes “forces them to look inward. And then to start making priorities and to get back to basics of police, fire, roads, sewage systems.”
After the meeting, Jacques said he wasn’t taken aback by the aggressive questioning by some members of the audience.
“I’m always prepared to engage with both passionate supporters and those who are not supporters, so I was not surprised,” he told the Phoenix in a text message. “This was our third annual town hall since elected. I welcome the constituent engagement — I work for all of them.”

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities late last month raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.

“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Immigration raid at Washington blaze stokes fear in wildfire crews nationwide

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

This week on the Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Elyse Cherry, CEO of BlueHub Capital, to discuss the recent court decision that BlueHub violated consumer protection statutes around lending. Where does the case go next, and why did lawmakers push for new rules tailored to BlueHub’s controversial lending practices? 
The post A[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Elyse Cherry, CEO of BlueHub Capital







A MUCH APPLAUDED and maligned mortgage program – Boston-based BlueHub Capital’s SUN program – promises to give second chances to homeowners in dire straits. But homeowners, mortgage, and consumer protection groups paint a darker picture: that the program is actually taking advantage of the people it claims to help.  
About a year after legislators passed and Gov. Maura Healey signed a law tailored to protect the Roxbury nonprofit from consumer protection liability, the organization is processing an unfavorable ruling from a Suffolk County Superior Court judge and bristling against new rules proposed by the attorney general to require more disclosure to homeowners about what they might owe and limit how much revenue the program can bring in. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith interviews Elyse Cherry, CEO of BlueHub Capital and Healey donor, about the ruling and the political machinations behind the new law signed by her longtime friend. 
“We think the judge is dead wrong,” Cherry said. “We do not think it’s predatory. As I say, I cannot imagine how a loan could be characterized as predatory when the borrowers owe less money than they owed in the first place.” 
When a homeowner is facing foreclosure. BlueHub, through an affiliated mortgage company, buys out the home and sells it back to the owner for 25 percent more than what BlueHub paid for it. Most of these homeowners also take on an unusual second mortgage known as a shared appreciation mortgage, which obligates the owner to pay a percentage of any future home appreciation to BlueHub if they want to sell or refinance the property. 
A group of homeowners sued in 2020, arguing that they did not understand the mechanics of the agreement when they first signed up. 
A Suffolk Superior Court judge last week found the nonprofit had violated state consumer protection laws on predatory lending practices. Judge Michael Ricciuti determined that BlueHub engaged in illegal “loan splitting” and did not disclose the full terms of the shared appreciation mortgage to homeowners.  
Ricciuti rejected arguments from BlueHub that the organization should be immune from consumer protection suit because it is engaged in a community-minded endeavor. The group’s “core activity is not charitable, but purely commercial,” he wrote. Cherry disputes that, arguing that the four decades of nonprofit work and lack of business competitors suggest this is not a profit-oriented organization.  
As the lawsuit progressed, lawmakers tried repeatedly to offer BlueHub some clear cover for its business practices. An effort in 2022 to make nonprofits offering shared appreciation mortgages – which only covers BlueHub in Massachusetts – retroactively immune from lawsuits as long as they make a limited set of required disclosures fizzled. But another version, that Cherry said specifically is not retroactive, passed in the sweeping 2024 economic development bill.  
Despite pleas to veto the language, Healey signed the bill into law. This sparked cries of personal favoritism, as Cherry has long maxed out donations and held fundraisers for the governor and former attorney general. For her part, Cherry notes a long history of political donations – including to the legislative leaders who had to sign off on the bill in the first place – and says the donations are personal but consistent with the nonprofit’s interest in supporting elected officials aligned with its mission. 
Next steps are still foggy. BlueHub plans to appeal the ruling at a later time. And after a seemingly sweeping win on Beacon Hill, the attorney general’s office is proposing a stricter set of disclosures under new regulations oriented at that business model. 
During the episode, Smith and Cherry discuss the legal ruling (8:15), the law designed to protect BlueHub (15:00), and what regulations the organization says it would accept (24:35).

The idea began when Executive Director Nathan Gotsch, himself a 2022 independent candidate for Congress, dug into election results across the state.
“In 2023 and 2024, 244 independent candidates qualified for partisan races,” Gotsch said in a news release. “More than half of them — 52% — won. Those results point to something real happening in Indiana politics.”
Independents aren’t just running for local offices. More are aiming higher, from countywide seats to the state legislature and even Congress. Nearly a third of independents who lost in 2023-2024 still received 30-49% of the vote.
The initiative highlighted some successful independents. in Huntington, Mayor Richard Strick left the GOP and won twice as an independent; in Bedford, Shawna Girgis served three terms as an independent mayor; and in Lewisville, former Republican state lawmaker Tom Saunders serves on the town council as an independent.
That lines up with an analysis by the Independent Voter Project of Hoosier voters’ partisan leanings.
Based on data from L2, a nonpartisan provider, nearly 44% of registered voters in Indiana are independents — compared to about 31% who are Republicans and 25% who are Democrats. Because Indiana does not register voters by party, these figures are estimated based on recent partisan primary participation and supplemented with modeling analytics, the release said.

Gotsch said “we’re proud to have financial support from multiple Hoosiers – both Republican and Democrat – who’ve seen the negative consequences of not having competitive elections in our state and believe in our mission to change that.”
He also runs Fort Wayne Politics, a free email newsletter about what’s happening behind the scenes in state and local politics.
Independent candidates in Indiana face high barriers, however.
To get on the ballot, candidates must collect petition signatures from registered voters equal to 2% of the most recent secretary of state vote in their district. For a statewide race, that means nearly 37,000 signatures — closer to 50,000 in practice once rejections are factored in. With paid circulators charging at least $15 per valid signature, ballot access for a statewide independent candidate can cost more than $700,000.
“These successful independents prove that voters will cross party lines when given the choice,” Gotsch said. “Independent Indiana exists to shine a spotlight on that success, develop educational resources for prospective candidates, and study what reforms are needed so independents can compete at every level of government.”
The initiative’s launch includes a statewide billboard campaign in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville, and northwest Indiana — and two September events:

Tim Walz, on Sept. 2, 2025, said he will call a special session to for lawmakers to vote on gun control measures after two children were killed and another 18 wounded at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis last week. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday said he will call a special session for Minnesota lawmakers to vote on a package of gun control measures, although passage seems unlikely in a closely divided Legislature.
Walz, after welcoming Deerwood Elementary School students to their first day of school in Eagan, said Minnesota needs to take action following a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis that killed 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski and wounded 18 others last week.
“If Minnesota lets this moment slide and we determine that it’s okay for little ones to not be safe in a school environment or a church environment, then shame on us,” Walz said. “I’m going to call (lawmakers) back.”
The governor said he will release a gun control package this week that will include an assault weapons ban.
Walz said he plans to call a special session even if he gets zero commitments from Republicans to vote for his gun control measures.
Republicans — led by Speaker Lisa Demuth and who are strongly aligned with the gun rights movement —  have 67 members in the House, while Democrats have 66 in their ranks following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman.
Walz and DFL lawmakers are hoping the shooting of a church filled with schoolchildren would pressure Republicans to accede to new laws. A special election to replace Hortman in safely blue District 34B is Sept. 16.
The special session will force Republicans to vote on gun control a little more than a year from a crucial midterm election when all 201 legislative seats will be on the ballot.
“When (Republicans) talk to the parents of these children and they hear the public speaking out, they get to make a decision. Are they going to stand in the way of having an honest debate? Now, we might not get it done in there, but the idea that you would not even come back and make a debate, I think, is untenable,” the governor said.
A majority of Minnesotans supported banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines in a MinnPost poll from 2022.
Democrats had full control of the Legislature in 2023 and 2024, but they failed to pass a statewide ban on assault weapons. They did pass a slate of other gun control measures, however. They instituted an extreme risk protection order, or “red flag,” law that allows family members or police to ask judges to take guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others and passed universal background check requirements.
Although a special legislative session would force Republicans to take potentially difficult votes on gun regulation, it would also give them an opportunity to propose legislation of their own. Although only the governor can call the Legislature into special session, only lawmakers have the power to adjourn.
Republicans are already signaling they will make a special session about culture war issues given the Annunciation Church shooter’s apparent trans identity.
Rep. Drew Roach, R-Farmington, said in a press release that he will propose a bill repealing a ban on conversion therapy if lawmakers are called into a special session. The law, passed in 2023, prohibits mental health professionals from providing therapy that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, dismissed the idea of a special election in a statement last week.
“Republicans are committed to addressing the root causes of violence, supporting safe schools and increasing access to mental health resources. Calling for a special session without even consulting legislative leaders is not a serious way to begin. This is a partisan stunt from a governor who continues to engage in destructive political rhetoric,” Johnson said.
Walz cautioned Republicans to keep a special session focused on gun control.
“If we call a special session, and (Republicans) decide to deflect this to something else, my guess is that that Minnesotans are not going to be too happy about that,” Walz said.
The governor on Tuesday said he’s open to proposing more resources for mental health in his gun control package, but guns are the culprit in mass shootings.
“I am not going to allow anyone to try and make the case that the United States is unique in either mental health issues or other things,” Walz said. “The thing that makes America unique in terms of shootings is we just have more guns and the wrong types of guns that are on the streets.”
Walz didn’t provide a timeline for when he plans to call lawmakers back to session, but he will likely wait at least until the House returns to a tie after the Sept. 16 special election.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/walzatdeerwood-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 10:57:57.288019

(LRC Public Information)The chair of the Senate Transportation Committee will not seek reelection after his term ends next year. 
Sen. Jimmy Higdon, a Lebanon Republican, will retire from the Kentucky General Assembly in December 2026. He was elected to the Senate in 2009. Before that, he was in the House beginning in 2003. 
“It has been the honor of my life to serve the people of the 14th District,” Higdon said in a Tuesday morning press release. “The greatest privilege of this job is getting to help people every single day. I’ve always tried to treat it as a calling, not just a position, and I am deeply thankful for the opportunity.”
Higdon’s Senate district includes the counties of LaRue, Marion, Nelson, Spencer and Washington. 
The senator said that he is “at the peak of my legislative career” and that “I have seen too many colleagues stay too long.” Spending more time with family was a key factor in his decision to not seek reelection. 
“I am 72 now. If I ran again, I’d be almost 78 at the end of another term,” Higdon said. “It’s the right time. My wife Jane, who has been by my side in marriage for 51 years, and my family deserve more of me. We’ve made a lot of sacrifices together to make this work, and I could not have done any of it without them.”
In addition to chairing the Senate Transportation Committee, Higdon is a member of the committees on Education; Licensing and Occupations; Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection. He was Senate majority whip from 2015 to 2018 and Senate president pro tempore from January 2018 to 2019. 
The 2026 legislative session will be Higdon’s final session in office. Republicans will continue to hold a supermajority in the Senate. Currently, the GOP has 32 of 38 seats in the chamber. 
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said in the press release that Higdon “will leave a lasting legislative legacy deeply woven into the fabric of this commonwealth.” 
“What stands out most about Jimmy is the way he has always put people first. He approaches every challenge with humility and common sense,” Stivers continued. “His voice will be deeply missed in our chamber by our caucus members and by our staff, who have enjoyed working with him. We are grateful to have one more session with him and to celebrate a career of service that he and Jane can be incredibly proud of.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/higdon101524-1024x691.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 10:57:57.288019

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on May 16 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).The son of a Republican lawmaker is suing Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe alleging his First Amendment rights were violated when Kehoe preemptively declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in anticipation of what turned out to be peaceful protests against the Trump administration across the state and nation in June. 
Lucas Cierpiot, a disability-rights activist from Blue Springs, said he felt intimidated by the governor’s actions and too unsafe to attend any “No Kings” protests  on June 14. His lawsuit alleges the order violated Cierpiot’s right to free speech, free assembly and association. 
It also was an act of discrimination based on disability, Cierpiot contends, since those with vision impairments would be uniquely vulnerable “to projectile weapons fired by crowd control troops.” Ciepriot is legally blind in one eye.
“It was an abuse of process to declare a false emergency when a true emergency did not exist,” Cierpoit writes in his lawsuit. “When Kehoe issued the order, there were no protests occurring anywhere in Missouri at all, and certainly not any that were un-peaceful.” 
A spokeswoman for Kehoe declined comment on the pending lawsuit, instead pointing to the governor’s June 12 statement when he declared the state of emergency. 
“We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest,” Kehoe said at the time, “but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state.”
Two days before scheduled protests in June, Kehoe signed Executive Order 25-25, activating the Missouri National Guard as a “precautionary measure” to protect against “events that are occurring or could occur.”
The move was denounced by the ACLU of Missouri as an “unnecessary provocation to thwart public dissent” and by House Minority Leader Ashley Aune as “a blatant attempt to intimidate and suppress First Amendment rights.”
A day after issuing the order, Kehoe announced that he would be leaving the country during the state of emergency for a long-planned trade mission to Europe. 
Anti-Trump ‘No Kings’ rallies draw thousands to peaceful protests across Missouri

Thousands gathered that Saturday at protests in cities and towns across the state, as well as around the steps of the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City. The weekend protests were peaceful and came and went without incident. 
Protesters demonstrated throughout the U.S. that day as President Donald Trump hosted a military parade in Washington on his birthday. The coordinated events followed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Demonstrators spoke against Trump’s immigration crackdowns and dismissals of federal workers. 
Cierpiot was not among the protesters. 
He writes that he originally planned to attend, given his history of advocating for “civil, constitutional and anti-discrimination rights of persons with blindness, low-vision and/or diseases of the eye.”
But Cierpiot said the governor’s order and the activation of the National Guard prevented him from participating in the protests. 
“Kehoe issuing this escalatory false emergency declaration represented a very real threat to plaintiff’s safety,” the lawsuit says, adding that Cierpiot was not afraid of anything related to the protests themselves and only felt unsafe due to the “possibility of police or military response.” 
Rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas, Cierpiot says in the suit, “are a significant threat to a patriot with low-vision and/or diseases of the eye,” threatening the “permanent loss of what remaining vision plaintiff does have as a price of exercising free speech.” 
Cierpiot — whose father is state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Lee’s Summit Republican — is currently representing himself in the lawsuit, which was filed in Jackson County. He said in an email to The Independent that he is in the process of interviewing attorneys. 
Last year, Cierpiot garnered headlines after filing a formal complaint accusing Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey of violating the rules of professional conduct for lawyers. The complaint focused on campaign contributions and accused Bailey of using his office “for his personal political benefit.”
The Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel declined to investigate the complaint, leading Cierpiot to request the Missouri Supreme Court intervene. The court declined to get involved and the ethics complaint was dismissed.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1968-e1747406679213-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-02 10:57:57.288019

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)More than 300 people turned out in an empty Columbus Arena District Monday to protest what they see as the depredations of the Trump administration.
It was Labor Day, and organizers and protesters both played up the fact that the administration’s biggest achievement so far is to take more than $1 trillion out of Medicaid and food assistance, while giving a $1 trillion tax break to the richest 1% of Americans. 
“They blame immigrants so you won’t blame billionaires,” one sign said in a reference to President Trump’s mass deportations.
“Save democracy, abolish oligarchy,” said another. 
But rally goers expressed other concerns — including that by trying to stigmatize efforts at diversity, Trump is weakening the country.
“I’m all about diversity. That’s why America is amazing to begin with,” said Karen Hill. “I don’t want people to live with cruelty. Every day it’s overwhelming. That’s why I’m here.”
A 1977 high school graduate, Hill said things seem worse now than they did then.
She said getting out and protesting makes her feel better when she becomes discouraged. 
“We’ve been to several,” she said. “I’m not saying we’re saving the world but I want to be here. I can’t take the chaos and everything. I’m always asking myself, what happened today. I’m tired of that. Somebody running our rights over. It’s not right. I don’t want to have a dictator.”

Addison Torrence, 26, said he turned out “to protect worker’s rights. To protect trans kids rights. All of our freedoms. Speak out against the corruption of the billionaire class.”
The crowd Monday appeared to be somewhat younger than the ones that came out to protest in Columbus during the first months of the Trump administration. 
“I’m hearing a lot of frustration and fear from people,” Torrence said of his friends.
Does that mean they’re tuning in?
“I’d like to think so,” Torrence said. “We’re out here showing something to the people we’re here to speak out for.”
Monday’s rally was organized by several groups, including the protest group 50501. It was one of dozens in Ohio and more than 1,000 across the country.
“At a time when the billionaire agenda is turning the federal government into a slush fund for the wealthy, gutting Medicaid, firing federal workers and ravaging families through ICE raids, working families are coming together to demand ‘workers over billionaires,'” 50501 said in a written statement.
Labor day rallies on workers’ behalf have a long history in the United States. In her Substack newsletter, historian Heather Cox Richardson on Sunday explained the history of the holiday. 
On Sept. 5, 1882, more than 10,000 paraded through lower Manhattan to highlight workers’ crucial role in an industrializing economy.
The marchers “carried banners saying: ‘Labor Built This Republic and Labor Shall Rule It,’ ‘Labor Creates All Wealth,’ ‘No Land Monopoly,’ ‘No Money Monopoly,’ ‘Labor Pays All Taxes,’ ‘The Laborer Must Receive and Enjoy the Full Fruit of His Labor,’ ‘Eight Hours for a Legal Day’s Work,’ and ‘The True Remedy Is Organization and the Ballot,'” Richardson’s essay said.

Perhaps foreshadowing the present day, the movement ignited a debate over income inequality and whether the people who decided how much everybody would get paid were really worth so much more than the people on the factory floor.
That debate raged as workers in 1884 helped to elect Grover Cleveland president. Then in 1888, Benjamin Harrison, the pro-Wall Street candidate, lost the popular vote, but won in the Electoral College. Four years later, there was a backlash, with Cleveland being re-elected in a landslide, Richardson wrote.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250901_163617-1024x644.jpg,,,2025-09-02 09:57:07.363879

In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
 Identical bill language

The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
Public schools would be required to allow dismissal for religious instruction under new bill

ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
 Ten Commandment displays

Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.










This is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment. 


– Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy


After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

The poll conducted for No Kid Hungry found that 96% of those surveyed said child hunger should not exist in the state. More than eight in 10 want elected officials to do more to end child hunger. Ninety-three percent said ending childhood hunger in Maryland should be a shared, bipartisan goal for lawmakers.
“This poll paints a stark picture of how Maryland families are suffering. No one should have to choose between purchasing food and paying your rent, but that’s an all-too-familiar choice our neighbors find themselves having to make,” Ayesha Holmes, No Kid Hungry Maryland director said in a statement. “With impending cuts to SNAP and Medicaid on the way, Maryland families will continue to face a future impacted by hunger and undue worry.”
The poll found that 65% of those surveyed said they had to choose between buying food or paying for gas or a car repair, rent or mortgage, or medical treatment. Within that survey, 71% of families said they had to make that choice, according to the poll. Nearly six in ten people said their mental health has suffered in the last 12 months due to the cost of food, according to the poll.

More than six in 10 said they worry about their ability to buy groceries if they were to be hit with an unexpected expense of $500.
The online survey conducted for No Kid Hungry sampled 1,054 Maryland residents between July 22-29. The margin of error is 4%.
The poll followed passage of federal legislation that makes permanent tax cuts made in 2017. The cuts are offset, in part, by cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Advocates say passage of the bill could deal “a devastating blow” to the 680,000 state residents who currently receive SNAP benefits.
Currently, the state and federal government split administrative costs for SNAP 50/50, while the federal government pays for 100% of the benefit.
That changes next year. States will pay 75% of the administrative fees. The cost to Maryland will approach an estimated $173 million. In 2027, Maryland will pick up 15% of the cost of the benefit on top of administrative costs -— about $240 million.
Nearly 370,000 Maryland resident could lose part or all of their benefits, according to a recent report by the Urban Institute.
The poll found that nearly six in 10 people had a favorable view of the SNAP program. More than 80% said Maryland should continue a summer program to ensure children have access to food when schools are closed.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SNAP-logo-USDA-1.jpg,,,2025-09-02 09:57:07.363879

However, as regular readers know, I love the game of baseball. And, on occasion, baseball references will make their way into my writing. This is one such occasion.
If you’ve come here for Iowa politics, however, please don’t turn away. I believe there is a political component to this story. And, later in this column, I will tell you about how, on a different topic, top Iowa Republicans are turning on one of their own. But first, baseball.
A few days ago, The Athletic reported Major League Baseball is coming back to Iowa next season.
After a four-year absence, there will be a Major League game at the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, the site of the 1989 movie of the same name. The game will be between the Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Phillies.
This will be an occasion for MLB to bask in the romanticism that stems from the movie starring Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones. Iowa’s tourism industry will benefit from the attention, too.
However, I think of this as more an occasion to point out how much MLB disrespects its fans living in Iowa, even as it seeks to leverage the nostalgia of the Field of Dreams. And I hope to the extent the state’s politicians celebrate this game next year, they’ll also remember the fans who are being mistreated.
Mostly, I’m talking about MLB.TV’s blackout rules. (I almost used the words “draconian blackout rules,” but as any baseball fan living in Iowa knows, it is unnecessary to apply the adjective.) In my area, six teams are not available to me, including those hundreds of miles away. It’s not at all unusual that, on any given day, 25-30% of the games on MLB.TV are blacked out. This even though no Major League team resides in Iowa.
I’m a Baltimore Orioles fan, so the remarkable run by the Milwaukee Brewers this year isn’t nearly as interesting to me as the implosion of my team, which pre-season prognosticators said would compete for the playoffs. Had I been interested, however, in watching the Brewers, I would be out of luck. Brewers’ games are blacked out, even though I have practically zero chance of seeing them otherwise. Even though I paid $150 for a yearlong subscription.
I realize that a lot of baseball fans across the country complain about blackout rules.
I also realize my complaints about MLB aren’t as articulate as those of other writers. For this, I recommend you read Joe Queenan’s recent column in the Wall Street Journal, where he contemplates the dispute between the Major League team owners and players over a possible salary cap — and suggests that neither side deserves our sympathy.
He concludes by saying, “whoever ultimately wins this battle, the fans are going to get screwed. As usual.”
Which is kind of the way I feel about the Field of Dreams game. MLB will benefit from the nostalgia for the game next year, and Iowa tourism will get a bump. Which is a good thing. Our economy definitely needs whatever boost it can get given the way things have been going.
However, if nothing changes, Iowa baseball fans who want to watch Major League teams will be left paying a hefty sum for the privilege of draconian (there, I said it) blackout rules that will leave them fuming.

State officials have barred the import, transport and sale of two fast-growing invasive species that were once popular garden ornamentals but have now wreaked havoc on natural vegetation.
The Alaska Division of Agriculture on Friday said it issued a quarantine for the two species: Prunus padus, commonly known as the European bird cherry tree or mayday tree, and Prunus virginiana, commonly known as the Canada red or chokecherry tree.

	The order went into effect Monday.
In essence, it will extend through the state a ban that was imposed in 2017 in Anchorage. The trees have become a particular nuisance in Alaska’s largest city, where they have proliferated in greenbelts and other spaces and crowded out native species like birch and spruce.
State and local officials have been trying to remove these non-native trees, and the new policy should help that effort, said Division of Agriculture Director Bryan Scoresby.
“This quarantine prohibits the importation, transport, and sale within the state of these two trees and their parts,” Scoresby said in a statement. “Many agencies continue to pursue control measures with the goal of eliminating these invasive trees. With this quarantine, the flow of trees into Alaska will stop, making this goal more attainable.”

The ornamentals quickly spread, displacing native vegetation, impeding animals’ access and upsetting natural food webs, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service.
Their berries can be toxic to moose, causing cyanide poisoning that is sometimes fatal.
Along with those problems, the invasives might be spreading disease to other trees, according to the Division of Agriculture. A fungal disease called “Black Knot” was recently discovered on chokecherry trees on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, making the invasive trees potential disease spreaders, the division said.
The two tree species are prime targets of annual Anchorage “weed smackdown” invasive-removal events. There is also a concerted effort to remove the trees from Fairbanks, including on the UAF campus, where officials have been methodically replacing them with native trees.
Eradicating the trees might require more than simply cutting them down because new trees can grow out of root systems below stumps, according to the Cooperative Extension Service.
For all the damage the two invasive tree species cause in Alaska, however, some people have found ways to benefit from them. The toxin in their berries can be neutralized and eaten by people.

Largely out of public view and with little to no debate, lawmakers on Friday sped through hundreds of bills that had new spending attached, rejecting or stalling more than a quarter of the 686 proposals that were held in the appropriations committees’ suspense files, report CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Jeanne Kuang. Some notable ones that are dead for the year are:

Senate Bill 445 to streamline California’s high-speed rail project, which aimed to speed up permitting and ease restrictions that bill supporters say significantly slow construction. Backed by the California High-Speed Rail Authority and Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill faced strong opposition from local governments and underwent multiple amendments before it was ultimately spiked.


Assembly Bill 938 to allow people to clear their records of violent crimes that they committed as victims of trafficking or domestic violence.


SB 712 to exempt owners of classic cars from the state’s smog-check requirements. As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, former late-night talk show host Jay Leno was one of the supporters of the bill, arguing that modern emissions standards discourage people from owning classic cars in California. Clean air and environmental groups opposed the measure, and state regulators warned that, if passed, the bill could cost California millions to enact. Read more here.

The Legislature still needs to give its final approval for the bills that advanced by Sept. 12 to reach Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, where the measures can win his signature or die with his veto. These include:

SB 707 to allow local officials to continue attending public meetings remotely and require bigger cities to offer remote access to the public. The proposal builds on a policy that offered flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, but good government groups say it is one that made it more difficult for the public to confront elected officials.


SB 437 to give California State University up to $6 million to research the methodology to confirm an individual’s status as a descendant of an enslaved person; and SB 518 to create a new bureau within the state Department of Justice to oversee reparations.

Gig workers step closer to unionizing rights


Demonstrators gather in support of new legislation allowing ride-hail drivers to unionize at the state Capitol in Sacramento on April 8, 2025. Photo by Louis Bryant III for CalMatters




CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California Uber and Lyft drivers are poised to gain the right to unionize under a deal touted as “historic” by the governor and the leaders of the state Assembly and Senate on Friday. 
AB 1340, sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, would give the drivers the right to unionize. It had been opposed by a group representing the gig companies, and an Uber spokesperson previously told CalMatters that it would mean increased costs for the company.
Now the bill is being tied to industry-sponsored legislation, SB 371, which would lower insurance-coverage requirements. Because Uber had been pushing for this change, it has withdrawn its opposition to the unionization bill, saying both bills represent a compromise. 
Gig companies like Uber and Lyft consider their drivers independent contractors. If drivers unionize, the companies would be required to bargain with them. 
A Lyft statement cheered the insurance bill but did not explicitly indicate support for the unionization bill, and a Lyft spokesperson said the company would have no comment about it.
Both bills advanced last week and the blessing by the state’s top politicians means their passage is all but assured.



Reexamining gang-related crimes?

Two decisions issued by the California Supreme Court last week could have major implications for sentencing gang-related offenses, and enable thousands of people to request their cases be reexamined by the courts, write CalMatters’ Joe Garcia and Nigel Duara.
One of the decisions overturned a defendant’s death sentence and kicked back the case to a trial court. The other sided with two incarcerated people who argued that prior gang-related charges that counted toward a three-strikes sentence on their records should not be considered as strikes.
Both rulings involved a 2021 California law that raised the bar of evidence for proving that someone broke a law as part of “criminal street-gang activity.”
In different ways, the state’s high court applied the new standard to past convictions. But it remains unclear how far-reaching these rulings will be, and whether it would open the door for others looking to reverse life sentences under the “three strikes” law.

Ethan Corson is running for governor in 2026 in what promises to be a robust primary campaign among Democrats and Republicans.,"Kansas state Sen. Ethan Corson, a Fairway Democrat seeking the party's nomination for governor in 2026, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast the state benefits from centrist, moderate leadership in the governor's office. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Ethan Corson said he had no interest in campaigning for Kansas governor by engaging in sleight-of-hand politics or the partisan food fights of strident liberals or conservatives.
“When folks look at what they need in the next governor, it’s not somebody who’s going to move this state to the right or move this state to the left. It’s somebody who is going to move this state forward,” Corson said. “I think Kansas has done better when we had common sense, common ground moderate leadership who can work with members of both parties to really solve problems.”
Corson, who resides in Fairway and represents a Kansas Senate district in Johnson County, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that he would concentrate as governor on lowering real-world costs borne by families. He would seek suitable financing of quality public schools. He would emphasize expansion of business opportunity and job creation throughout the state’s 105 counties.


The office of governor is a wide open race for Republicans and Democrats in the August primary and November general elections of 2026. Term-limited Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly will step aside in January 2027.
The Democratic field features Corson and state Sen. Cindy Holscher, who also serves a district in Johnson County. The Republican campaign is numerically more robust. The GOP roster includes former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt and Senate President Ty Masterson. All six contenders were at one time in the Legislature.
Corson, 43, grew up dreaming of playing baseball at the University of Kansas or Kansas State University. That didn’t work out. Instead, he was a left-handed pitcher at Garden City Community College and Washington University in St. Louis. He earned degrees at both schools before completing a law degree at WU.
“In the Garden City experience, I really learned so much,” he said. “I was on a team with folks from all around the state, from all different backgrounds who brought all different kinds of life experiences. It really opened my eyes to the beauty of the state, to the diversity of the people around the state and to kind of our common values in Kansas.”
 
Quality of life issues
Corson worked as an attorney in private practice in the District of Columbia for seven years. He was a senior adviser to the U.S. Department of Commerce secretary under President Barack Obama. At the Department of Commerce, he was chief of staff of the International Trade Association.
He returned to Kansas to become executive director of the Kansas Democratic Party. In 2020, he was elected to the Kansas Senate and won reelection in 2024. He’s married to Jenna Brofsky, a labor lawyer who served on the Fairway City Council. They have two sons.
In the Legislature, Corson said he was proud to have been part of a coalition that eliminated the state’s 6.5% sales tax on groceries as well as the state’s income tax on Social Security benefits. He said not enough attention had been paid by the Republican-led Legislature to other options for moderating basic costs faced by families.
“Kansas has been a place where you could send your kid to a good public school and where you could have an affordable middle class quality of life,” Corson said. “I worry that we’ve moved away from that.”
He said he would move Kansas forward through construction of more middle-income housing. He would seek a bipartisan child tax credit to help parents with young kids. He said the state ought to expand a property tax freeze for elderly residents, because too few qualify for the existing program.
He said the state’s $7.25 per hour minimum wage was inadequate. Oklahoma likewise ties its minimum wage to the federal standard of $7.25, but the minimum stood at $13.50 in Nebraska, $13.75 in Missouri and $14.81 in Colorado.
“If you’re working full-time in Kansas, you should not be living in poverty,” Corson said.
He said Kansas had to push for excellence in education and economic development so young Kansans didn’t feel they had to leave the state to do what they wanted professionally.
“When I’m governor, if the Legislature sends me a bill that I don’t think adequately and fully funds our schools, I’m going to veto that bill. If the Legislature sends me a bill that’s going to take public money and put it into private schools, I’m going to veto that bill,” he said.
 
Health care, constitution
Corson has endorsed legislation to expand Medicaid eligibility for lower-income Kansans. That effort has been stalled by Republicans for more than a decade despite apprehension that rejecting billions of dollars in federal aid financially weakened hospitals and clinics. Pending federal cuts to Medicaid could elevate the threat, Corson said.
“We could have facilities closing over the next couple of years,” he said. “One of the things to remember is that when a hospital in the community closes it’s not just the people on Medicaid who lose access. It’s everybody.”
He said he opposed a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have nullified a Kansas Supreme Court decision affirming women had a fundamental right to end a pregnancy. The amendment failed 59% to 41%.
“These are not decisions where we need politicians in Topeka dictating what kind of health care women can and can’t receive,” he said.
Corson said he opposed a constitutional amendment to be placed on the August 2026 ballot that would replace the state’s merit-selection process for appointing Supreme Court justices with a system of statewide election of the justices.
He said the resulting election campaigns would be financed by organizations or individuals with ideological agendas rather than a commitment to the review of case facts in terms of the constitution and court precedent.
“I don’t think Kansans want to basically put the Supreme Court up for sale to the highest bidder,” Corson said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P8250214b-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

Recently appointed Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia announced Tuesday that he is running for a four-year term for the position in 2026.
“My name is Blaise Ingoglia. I speak four languages: English, profanity, sarcasm, and real s—,” the native New Yorker says in a campaign video released Tuesday morning. “I’m running for Chief Financial Officer because I am done watching taxpayers get screwed by governments gone wild.”
That anti-tax attitude has fueled Ingoglia’s biggest public initiative since being appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to replace Jimmy Patronis in July — leading a team of Florida DOGE auditors to scrutinize spending by city and county governments throughout the state.
Ingoglia has been a major player in Florida politics for over a decade. He was first elected to the Florida House in 2014, and the next year was elected to chair the Republican Party of Florida (he served in that position until 2019). He had served in the Florida Senate representing Hernando County since 2020 until DeSantis appointed him to the Cabinet position earlier this summer.
The chief financial officer of Florida is one of three Cabinet-level positions in state government, along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, and goes up for election every four years. Together, they help the governor administer a number of state agencies.
The CFO is the statutory head of the Department of Financial Services, which oversees more than a dozen state agencies, including the State Fire Marshal, Consumer Services, and Inspector General. The position pays $140,000 a year.
Ingoglia is the only major candidate to declare for the Florida CFO position so far. Until recently, he was the underdog in the race, with fellow Republican Joe Gruters — already endorsed by Donald Trump — crushing him in one political poll.
However, that challenge was averted after Trump picked Gruters to head the Republican National Committee, which happened late last month.

Gavin Newsom stepped up to a lectern on a March day three years ago and proposed a new solution to one of the state’s most difficult problems: How to help the thousands of Californians sleeping on the streets while suffering from severe mental illness. 
After all, he said, everything the state has done before has failed. One of the state’s prior attempts — a treatment referral program called Laura’s Law – helped just 218 people during the 2018-19 fiscal year, he said.
“That certainly is not demonstrable progress,” Newsom said. His new program would be different. 
But in the nearly two years since Newsom launched CARE Court, it has reached only a few hundred people. That’s barely more than the law he criticized, and certainly not the thousands he promised.
CalMatters requested CARE Court data from every county in California and conducted more than 30 interviews to compile the first detailed, statewide look at the program. Up and down California, the data show low numbers, a slow rollout and predictions that wildly outpaced reality.
The program was designed to allow family members, first responders, doctors and others to petition the courts on behalf of someone with severe psychosis who can’t take care of themselves. If the petition is accepted, that person can then agree to voluntary treatment, which can include counseling, medication, housing and more.
If they refuse, a judge can order them to participate in a treatment plan.
CalMatters received responses from all but four of the state’s 58 counties. Here’s what the data shows:  

While Newsom’s administration estimated between 7,000 and 12,000 Californians would qualify for CARE Court, just 2,421 petitions have been filed through July, according to the Judicial Council of California. Only 528 of those have resulted in treatment agreements or plans.
San Diego County anticipated receiving 1,000 petitions in the first year and establishing court-ordered treatment plans for 250 people. But in nearly two years, the county instead has received just 384 petitions and established 134 voluntary agreements.
Los Angeles County saw 511 petitions filed – the most in the state. Of those, 112 resulted in care agreements or plans. In 2023, officials predicted to news organizations the county could enroll 4,500 people in the first year.
Courts across California are dismissing a significant percentage of CARE Court petitions – about 45% statewide, although that number includes the handful of cases in which someone has successfully “graduated” from the program. The rate is even higher in some counties, such as San Francisco, where nearly two-thirds of petitions are thrown out. 
The allure of CARE Court for many supporters was the promise of court-ordered treatment plans that would encourage sick people to accept the help they’d been resisting. But the courts have ordered just 14 treatment plans so far, according to the Judicial Council. Instead, most counties are solely offering voluntary treatment “agreements,” which sick people are free to ignore.
Very few people have successfully completed CARE Court. Despite the fact that it has the most petitions, Los Angeles County has had no graduations. Nine counties have been operating CARE Court long enough to have graduations (the program takes at least a year to complete). 

“It’s going much more slowly than we thought it would,” said Lisa U’Ren, a former member of the  board of directors at the Solano County branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who helped roll out the program in her county. 
The stakes are high for Newsom, who has tied his legacy in part to big promises that he would address California’s twin problems of homelessness and inadequate mental health services. The establishment of CARE Court was followed by a 2023 law intended to make it easier for a judge to order someone into involuntary treatment. A successful 2024 ballot measure issued $6.4 billion in debt to pay for new mental health housing. 

How CARE Court works
Once someone files a CARE Court petition on behalf of a person experiencing psychosis, the county investigates that person’s diagnosis and then the court determines if they are eligible for the program. If they are, they have regular meetings with a case worker, as well as regular court hearings, with the goal of agreeing to a treatment protocol called a “CARE agreement.”
If a voluntary agreement can’t be reached, the court can order the person to follow a CARE plan. After one year, the client can either complete the program and graduate, or extend for up to one more year.

State officials say CARE Court needs more time to hit the goals initially set by the Newsom administration. Already some counties are doing an “incredible job,” said Stephanie Welch, deputy secretary of behavioral health for the state Health and Human Services Agency. She pointed to Alameda County, which has racked up 125 petitions — among the most in the state – since December. 
“I think this has been a complicated program to implement,” Welch said, “and that’s something that we recognize and we’ve been doing our best to support the counties to be able to expand this program.”
A spokesperson for Newsom’s office said the administration is pleased with what the program has accomplished so far.
“Thanks to the CARE Act, thousands of people are engaging in critical behavioral health treatment through stabilizing medications, community-based care, and — if needed — housing,” Elana Ross said in an emailed statement.

But disability rights organizations say the low numbers are evidence that the program was a waste of money, a reactionary political gambit by a governor with presidential aspirations. And many families who initially threw their support behind CARE Court also say it has come up short. 
Anita Fisher advocated for the program when Newsom proposed it, speaking on 60 Minutes about her family’s story and meeting with the governor himself, she said. When the program was piloted in San Diego County, where she lives, she felt hopeful about its promise to treat people with serious mental illness, like her son.
“I’ve watched my son suffer too many times: jail, prison, homeless,” she said. “And I said, ‘so if this can stop that?’ I said, ‘Yes, I’m all for it.’”
But now?
“I look at it as a total failure.” 
A petition could be rejected because the person doesn’t meet the narrow eligibility criteria (only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders qualify). When the subject of a petition is homeless, outreach workers sometimes have trouble finding them on the street. Other times, the client simply refuses services – and, CARE Court has little teeth to force them to accept, even after a judge’s order.
Making more people eligible for CARE Court
A bill making its way through the Legislature could boost CARE Court numbers by making more people eligible. If Sen. Thomas Umberg’s Senate Bill 27 becomes law, people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder would qualify for the program.
The program as it stands is not broken, the senator said, it’s a “work in progress” that needs some tweaking to reach its full potential.
“To some degree, expectations were raised, some that were accurate, some that were not accurate, that this was going to be a panacea,” Umberg said. “And I never thought of it that way.”
But it’s unclear how many more people could enter into CARE Court as a result of Umberg’s bill. His office has no estimate, and other guesses vary widely. San Diego County says the bill could increase its numbers by anywhere from 3.5% to 48.1%.
Many disability rights organizations strongly oppose the bill, saying it will significantly expand an ineffective program, doing nothing to solve underlying issues of housing shortages and inadequate mental health services
“They’re not trying to fix a problem, they’re trying to deliver political optics, and that’s all this ever was,” said Lex Steppling, a founding member of All People’s Health Collective. 
Eve Garrow, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said that, “given what I consider to be the failure of CARE Court so far,” she expects Umberg’s bill is primarily an effort to increase the number of petitions. 
“A court order doesn’t make resources appear out of thin air,” she said.

The state spent $88.3 million on CARE Court in the 2022-23 fiscal year, and $71.3 million in 2023-24, according to a Legislative Analyst’s Office analysis. With fewer than 550 people receiving services through the program so far, critics accuse CARE Court of wasting state money.
The Assembly Judiciary Committee’s July analysis of SB 27 described  CARE Court as a “very expensive” way to coordinate services. 
But California counties say the low numbers of CARE agreements don’t capture the entirety of the program’s impact. Even petitions that don’t lead to official agreements have afforded counties the chance to connect with and offer services to people they hadn’t previously known.
“I would say that I think the whole idea of looking at the numbers, it sort of misses the point,” said Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the California Behavioral Health Directors Association. “With anything coercive, the goal is to try to engage people out of their own free will into services.” 
One of CARE Court’s successes, she said, has been in spreading the word about county services to people who might need them. If those people then express interest without the need for any coercion, “that’s a success and so far that has not been quantified,” she said.
The state has attempted to quantify that elusive number: As of December, people were diverted away from CARE Court and into other county services 1,358 times, according to a recent report from the Health and Human Services Agency.
Counties administering CARE Court also said it’s one of the few state programs that funds outreach. It can require a lot of attempts before outreach workers can coax certain people into services, they said, and this provides a mechanism to pay for those efforts.
A flood of petitions that never materialized
Eight California counties rolled out CARE Court at the end of 2023, as part of a pilot group. The rest of the state had the program up and running by December 2024.
As San Diego County counted down to the launch, officials worried they would be flooded with petitions immediately, said Amber Irvine, the county’s behavioral health program coordinator. 
The county hired nearly two-dozen people, including 10 clinicians, two psychologists and support staff to meet the expected demand. The money for those new positions came from county funds, not from the state.
That flood of petitions never materialized. 
Irvine thinks the process of filing a petition was harder than expected. Her team thought first responders, hospitals and behavioral health workers would jump at the chance to refer people into the program. But that didn’t happen. The petitioner has to attend at least the first court hearing, which is something many overworked first responders and clinicians can’t do, Irvine said.
Police and firefighters filed petitions when the program first started, but they were often dismissed – which made the first responders reluctant to file more, said Crystal Robbins, who manages a treatment referral program for San Diego Fire-Rescue.
“We quickly found out that it wasn’t a useful tool for the people that we see,” she said.

The process also is tough for families petitioning on behalf of loved ones, Irvine said. It requires them to prove their loved one has a qualifying mental health condition, but federal privacy laws can make that a big hurdle.
The county is trying to make the process less cumbersome, Irvine said. It is letting family members and some other petitioners attend court hearings virtually, for example. And in some cases, the court is allowing petitions to move on to the next step even if they don’t have all the required paperwork.
So far, San Diego County Superior Court has received the second-largest number of petitions in the state — 384, with 35% leading to CARE agreements.
But that’s still far behind initial projections.
The slow start could be a “happy accident,” Irvine said, because the low case load allows clinicians to spend more time with each CARE Court client. 
But Anita Fisher isn’t the only family member who feels discouraged about the program’s roll out in San Diego. 
Tanya Fedak said she has twice filed petitions in the county on behalf of her son, who continues to cycle between homelessness and jail despite being accepted into CARE Court.  
“These are our loved ones,” she said. “It’s our taxpayers’ money. There’s no accountability. And it’s frustrating to see it go down, because my son is going to end up dead.”  
Orange County, which was part of the initial CARE Court cohort, expected to receive 1,400 petitions and establish between 400 and 600 treatment plans its first year. Two years later, it has received at least 176 petitions , reached 14 CARE agreements and ordered one CARE plan, according to the county’s behavioral health department. That doesn’t include additional petitions that could have been dismissed by the court before reaching the county.
Orange County was the only superior court in the state with a significant number of petitions that did not disclose its data to CalMatters.   
Veronica Kelley, director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said she never expected to reach as many people as the original estimate. She attributed that in part to the county already reaching many people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder through its existing assisted outpatient treatment program (the program created by the law Newsom criticized at the 2023 press conference), which provides similar services to CARE Court.
Kelley believes expanding the older program would have been a better use of the resources now going to CARE Court. In part, she said, that’s because Orange County’s assisted outpatient program makes it easy for people to ask the county for help, whereas filing a CARE petition is “a laborious process” that requires significant work from the petitioner.
Other people blame the low CARE Court numbers on a lack of awareness.
After CARE Court rolled out in Solano County, the local branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness hosted town halls to teach the community about the program. An in-person town hall drew about 10 people, said NAMI Solano County Executive Director Deb Demello. Two Zoom meetings drew about four people each. And they didn’t see people from the main group they were trying to reach: family members of people with a severe mental illness.
“We had very little turn out,” Demello said.

CARE Court use  varies widely county by county, with some smaller counties appearing to struggle with the resources to implement the program. Colusa County, with a population of fewer than 22,000 people on the edge of the Mendocino National Forest, told the state last year that its courts weren’t prioritizing CARE Court because of court vacancies. The county has received just one petition.
Eight small counties, including Mendocino and San Benito, said they’ve had no petitions filed. 
Some county courts refused to disclose their data to CalMatters because the numbers were too small, citing the California Rules of Court, which allow courts to withhold data if the sample size is so small that people could be identified. 
Courts are required to report limited CARE Court data to the California Judicial Council, including the number of petitions submitted, number of agreements and plans, and number of dismissals. But the council would give only statewide totals to CalMatters, not a county-by-county breakdown. 
Will expanding CARE Court help more people?
Even if someone becomes one of the few Californians represented in a CARE Court petition, it doesn’t mean they’ll get help.
In San Francisco, the majority of petitions filed end up getting dismissed – 49 of the 75 – or 65% – of those filed. That’s one of the highest dismissal rates in the state.
Some counties, including San Francisco, told CalMatters that people may still receive services even if their CARE Court petition is dismissed. But a state report released in July found that of the 160 people whose petitions were dismissed during the first nine months of CARE Court, 90 did not receive county behavioral health services. 
Of the 130 petitions dismissed in Los Angeles County between December 2023 and February of this year, 43 were dismissed because the person was already receiving “adequate mental health services,” according to a report by the county’s department of mental health. It’s the most common reason for a dismissal in that county.

Umberg wants to address that with his bill. Currently, someone can’t qualify for CARE Court if they are already “clinically stabilized” in another treatment program. Umberg’s bill would clarify that just being enrolled in an outside treatment program doesn’t mean someone is stable. He hopes that will cut down on the number of people whose petitions are dismissed even though their mental illness is not under control. 
His bill would also make it easier for the criminal justice system to funnel people into CARE Court, by allowing a judge to refer someone directly into the program if they are charged with a misdemeanor and deemed incompetent to stand trial. 
Irvine, San Diego County’s behavioral health program coordinator, is not thrilled about Umberg’s plan to expand CARE Court. The California Behavioral Health Directors Association also opposes the bill. 
Irvine takes pride in the amount of time and energy her staff put into each CARE Court client. She says they spend weeks or even months getting to know them, bringing them their favorite foods, and helping with minor tasks, such as getting a new phone, before finally convincing them to participate in the program. In at least one case, that process took as long as five months, she said.
By some accounts, San Diego County’s approach is working. It has had 10 graduations so far, the most of any county that reported that metric to CalMatters.
Adding a lot more people into the program would give clinicians less time to spend with each client, Irvine said. And Umberg’s bill doesn’t come with money to hire more staff.

New California Supreme Court rulings trim their sentences,Joe Garcia and Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/gang-enhancements-three-strikes/,"Two new California Supreme Court rulings sided with prisoners contesting past gang-related charges, decisions that could affect 'three strikes' cases.","In summary
Two new California Supreme Court rulings sided with prisoners contesting past gang-related charges, decisions that could affect ‘three strikes’ cases.


The California Supreme Court handed down two decisions last week that could impact decades of sentencing for gang-related offenses and allow thousands of people to petition courts to reexamine their cases. 
Both rulings turned on a 2021 law that raised the standard of evidence for proving that someone broke a law as part of  “criminal street gang activity.” In different ways, the Supreme Court chose to apply the new standard to past convictions.
One decision took an incarcerated person off Death Row; the other sided with two incarcerated people who contested past “strikes” on their records that set them on course for lengthy sentences. 
It’s uncertain how far-reaching the two rulings will be. Both of them came in split decisions, reflecting disagreements about how to apply the 2021 law retroactively. 
In one case, a 4-3 majority determined that prior gang-related charges did not hold up under new legal standards and thus could not be used as strikes.
Larry Fletcher and Eric Anthony Taylor Jr. argued that 2015 gang enhancement convictions could not be applied as “strikes” toward a three-strikes sentence for a 2020 attempted murder, as their convictions were still under appeal when the 2021 law went into effect.
The California Supreme Court ultimately agreed and vacated the 2015 prior convictions as gang-related and therefore offenses that no longer counted as a “strike” — remanding the trial court to potentially retry them under the new law’s redefined elements of gang offenses and enhancements.
It remains unclear exactly how far the Fletcher and Taylor decision will set precedent for other individuals looking to reverse life sentences under the “three strikes” law.
Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero dissented from the decision. She warned that applying the gang enhancement law to past strikes would set a legal standard that would be “virtually impossible to meet”. 
She admonished her fellow justices for invoking “the authority to change the Three Strikes law under the guise of interpreting it.”
Overturning a death sentence
A second case, ruled on Thursday, upended a defendant’s death sentence and remanded his case back to trial court. 
The case was decided 5-2, upholding Jason Aguirre’s 2009 murder and attempted murder convictions, but sending it back to trial court in Orange County for what the court described as “further proceedings.”  Both the majority and dissenting opinions said they would have reversed the defendant’s gang enhancements. 
Aguirre was a late-20s white man who prosecutors allege hung out with a Vietnamese youth gang called the Dragon Family Junior in Orange County. 
One night in 2003, he and a few younger accomplices chased a group of people from a restaurant to a cul-de-sac where members of the group crashed their car. Aguirre shot three of them, and one, 13-year-old Minh Tran, died. 
At trial, a detective testified that Aguirre shot three people for the reputational benefit of the gang. At the time, that was a valid reason for a prosecutor to pursue gang enhancements to a defendant’s sentence. 
But the 2021 law changed that. Now, the law says that gang enhancements have to show that any benefit the gang received from criminal activity has to be “‘more than reputational.”
“Understandably, given when the trial below took place, defendant’s jury was not given instructions that track the revised language of (the 2021 law),” Guerrero wrote in the majority opinion. 
“With the relevant aspects of Assembly Bill 333 (the 2021 law) applying retroactively, this disconnect with the law as it has since been amended constitutes error affecting defendant’s conviction for active participation in a criminal street gang.”
Gang enhancements in tough-on-crime era
Gang enhancements and so-called three-strike sentences date back decades, to when California’s crime numbers were peaking in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
State legislators in 1988 enacted the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention (STEP) Act in response to rising gang crime and violence, notably most visible in Los Angeles neighborhoods.
Participation or association with an alleged gang or gang members became highly subjective criminal acts that added sentencing enhancements for felonies committed “to benefit a criminal street gang.”
Then, during the era of the so-called “super predator,” voters in 2000 approved Proposition 21, which expanded the provisions of the STEP Act and increased mandatory sentencing for gang-related crimes.
Over the next two decades, local prosecutors in California pursued allegations of criminal street gang activity for both violent and nonviolent felony charges.
Critics, activists and reform advocates argued that gang allegations and gang enhancements disproportionately and unfairly targeted defendants from minority and low-income communities — and that low thresholds of evidence led to prejudiced juries, resulting in disproportionately severe sentences, primarily for people of color.
In 2021, the STEP Forward Act — legislation authored by then-Assembly member Sydney Kamlager-Dove of Los Angeles — attempted to address the inequities and excessive punitive impact of the original STEP Act and its amendments. The STEP Forward Act is the law at the center of the two new California Supreme Court rulings.
It substantially changed the criteria by which convicted felonies could be categorized as gang-related or established as a “pattern” of gang activity, and further required courts to honor a defense request for separate proceedings to determine such gang allegations.
“Current gang enhancement statutes criminalize entire neighborhoods historically impacted by poverty, racial inequality, and mass incarceration as they punish people based on their cultural identity, who they know, and where they live,” the bill stated.

Susan Bustamante is a member of the California Coalition for Women Prisoners.


Thirty years ago, I did the bravest thing I could imagine: I asked for help.
I had survived years of childhood sexual abuse by my father, followed by a violently abusive marriage. For years my husband beat me, threatened me, forced me into isolation and even forced me to have an abortion.
I endured it and stayed quiet until I couldn’t anymore. I had two daughters to protect.
When I confided in my brother and explained what was happening, I believed I was taking a first step toward freedom. I never expected my husband would be killed and that I would be charged with his death, accused of plotting to collect a life insurance payout.
I believed the truth would protect me, that if the courts knew about the years of abuse, they would understand. However, at trial I was barred from discussing the years of trauma, fear and violence. Antiquated laws meant my truth was silenced. 
I was sentenced to life without parole.
This was not justice, but I am not alone. A Stanford University survey of women incarcerated in California for murder or manslaughter found nearly 75% had experienced intimate partner violence the year before their offense.
California law allows courts to ignore that context — even when a person’s actions were the direct result of agony, coercion or desperation. Survivors often are punished without being able to tell their full story.
If Assembly Bill 938 passes, it would give survivors a chance to present evidence of abuse and trauma. This testimony isn’t just a defense; it’s a crucial part of the truth. It ensures that what came before a moment of crisis is not erased.
We’ve seen some progress in recent years. More survivors of human trafficking are getting a chance to clear their criminal records, which often resulted from their exploitation. That has made a difference: It has brought families together and reopened doors to jobs, housing and healing.
But many other survivors of trafficking, domestic violence, and child abuse are still denied relief because current law is too narrow. Their suffering is pushed aside. Their records follow them for life. 
Abusers and traffickers often force their victims to commit crimes. They use illegal acts as tools of control and threats of exposure as a leash. This results in survivors facing lengthy prison sentences while the abuse they endured is left out of the courtroom entirely.
AB 938 would allow judges to hear about the years of psychological manipulation and impossible choices survivors have to make. It doesn’t create loopholes; it creates fairness. It doesn’t excuse harm; it acknowledges harm that was already done.
When survivors are believed and supported, they can do more than just survive. They heal. They raise families. They rebuild their communities. But that only happens when the justice system sees them as whole people with whole stories.
Though I was sentenced to die in prison, I was granted commutation in 2017. I came home to a world that had moved on without me. I’d missed my daughters’ weddings and my grandchildren’s births — moments I’ll never get back. 
Yet I carried on and reconnected with my family. I’m building a life with the time I have left. I don’t need pity. I needed a court that listened.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081225_Jury-Duty_AH_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

(Photo Courtesy of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation) It was the deadliest massacre of indigenous people in U.S. history. But today, many still don’t know the story. 
It was 1863, on an icy January morning, at dawn. Hundreds of members of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation were sleeping where they had settled for the winter along the Bear River, or as they call it, “Wuda Ogwa.” 
The Shoshone Nation were a nomadic tribe, but every winter they would make this place their home, near what’s now known as Preston, Idaho. There, they’d fish for trout and hunt game birds. Hot springs nearby warmed the ground, heating their tepees and lodges, and giving their horses a place to graze in an otherwise frost-bitten landscape. 
But that day, the tribe was nearly entirely wiped out. 
U.S. military soldiers — led by Col. Patrick Edward Connor — set out from Ft. Douglas, Utah, toward Chief Bear Hunter’s camp, reportedly in retaliation for Shoshoni raids. The soldiers killed an estimated 300, including women and children, according to historians, though tribal leaders say it was more, closer to 500. Connor reported his troops counted 224 bodies, destroyed more than 70 lodges, seized 175 horses, and captured 160 women and children, according to National Park Service records. 
Though they were few, some of the Northwestern Band survived. Today, their descendants are working to reclaim the site of the massacre as their home — and restore its natural ecosystem. 
“This is a graveyard. This is our Arlington Cemetery,” Brad Parry, vice chairman of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation’s tribal council, said in a PBS documentary about the tribe’s restoration project. “This is where our people had to fight for their freedom to exist.” 


“I want to take this land back in time, to when it was wild,” Parry continues. “And restore our connection to it.” 
Parry and other tribal leaders held a forum Wednesday at the Northwestern Band’s tribal office in Ogden, Utah, to share the massacre’s history — and also share how the tribe is working to restore the land. 
There, Parry told a room of more than 140 people that his grandmother, Mae Timbimboo Parry, learned about the massacre directly from her grandfather, Yeager Timbimboo, who was about 12 years old when the attack happened. To survive, he hid among dead bodies.
“He laid on the frozen ground, playing dead,” Parry said. “A soldier saw him playing dead, raised his rifle at him three times, but didn’t shoot.” 
Now, more than 160 years later, Parry is leading the effort to give the site of the massacre new life. Though its history is fraught with horrific bloodshed, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that tribal leaders want to turn their grief into healing. 
“We’ve wallowed long enough. We’ve been sad long enough. This has been detrimental long enough. Let’s flip the script,” he said. “Let’s take it back to what our ancestors would recognize and start bringing the community back to the land. And not just indigenous communities, but all communities.”

Since the Bear River Massacre, the Northwestern Band hasn’t had any land to call home. Their tribe was never given a reservation. 
But in 2018, the tribe purchased about 350 acres of land around the massacre site. Their goal, Parry said, is to restore it to its wild, natural state, and to help the river’s ecosystem thrive. 
And because all things in nature are connected — what happens in one ecosystem can affect another — the efforts to restore that section of the Bear River can have a cascading effect on a downstream neighbor that’s in dire need. 
How the Wuda Ogwa restoration could bring more water to the Great Salt Lake
The Bear River is the largest tributary of the Great Salt Lake, which has been shrinking to dangerously low levels due to drought, climate change and water diversion for agriculture and development. Today, the lake remains on the brink of ecological collapse. 
The drying Great Salt Lake poses an existential threat to not only the wildlife that rely on its waters and wetlands, but also to people. Less water means more exposed lake bed, leading to dust storms laced with cancer-causing carcinogens like arsenic. In Utah, leaders are all in agreement — for the sake of Utah’s future, the Great Salt Lake must be saved. 
And the Wuda Ogwa restoration project could play a part.

Tribal leaders say researchers’ models have predicted that the restoration of Bear River natural habitats could help send an estimated 13,000 acre-feet of water to the Great Salt Lake a year by ripping out water-sucking invasive plants and replacing them with native plants, cleaning out creeks, and restoring old agricultural fields to wetlands. 



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


The Great Salt Lake needs every drop of water it can get, so that amount of water isn’t insignificant — but it would far from solve the lake’s crisis. It needs about 8 to 15 more vertical feet of water (the equivalent of two Bear Lakes) to be healthy, according to the Great Salt Lake Collaborative. 
And whether that water will actually flow all the way to the Great Salt Lake is still an open question. The tribe has secured water rights for the project, Parry said, but because it crosses state lines, tribal leaders have encountered challenges from leaders in Idaho during water rights adjudication discussions. 
“One of the biggest problems that we’ve found is the state above you — their users don’t care about the Great Salt Lake,” Parry said. “I can say that because we’ve been involved in adjudication, and instead of asking how they can protect their water rights, (they ask), ‘Are you guys doing this for the Great Salt Lake?’”
Asked to clarify those comments, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that in talking with Idaho state officials and irrigation farming districts in Idaho, “their goal isn’t to help us save the Great Salt Lake.” 
Parry said the tribe has its own, primary reasons for wanting to restore the land and the wetlands — but the benefits to the Great Salt Lake would be a positive consequence of the restoration that the tribe also supports. 
He added that tribal leaders have found that the further away from the Great Salt Lake, there’s less interest in helping save it. But he argued “we’re all in this together,” and the impacts from toxic dust from the dried lake bed would be far-reaching, including potentially in other states like Idaho.
“If the states don’t start working with each other, it’s never going to happen,” he said.  
The Wuda Ogwa restoration project
Parry said the tribe has secured roughly $13 million in various state and federal grants and other funding sources for the river restoration project. 
During Wednesday’s forum, tribal leaders and researchers detailed how after the Bear River Massacre, colonial settlement transformed what was once the Bear River’s natural bends and wetlands into farm and grazing land. Since then, it has become a shadow of what it once was. 
Now, thanks to the help of volunteers on weeding and planting days, the tribe is working to remove invasive plants and replace them with native vegetation. They’re also working with engineers and biologists to reshape the river and its wetlands to a more natural state to help attract back fish, birds and other wildlife.

One of the biggest foes they’re working to root out is the Russian Olive. The thorny, invasive tree that sucks up massive amounts of water has taken over the river shoreline.  
Brian Andrew, an engineer at the firm Hansen Allen and Luce that’s been hired by the tribe for the project, said there are an estimated 400,000 Russian Olive plants on a 60-acre area of the site. A mature Russian Olive tree consumes an estimated 75 gallons of water a day and crowds out other native plants like willows and cottonwoods. 
Early in the project, Parry said tribal leaders envisioned building a geothermal heated amphitheater and cultural interpretative center. But he said the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted funding, and construction costs have since skyrocketed. 
Now, Parry said the tribe is focused on restoring the land first and foremost, now envisioning a trail system as a way for members of the public to experience the wetlands once they’re thriving. 
So far, the tribe’s partners estimate they’ve planted and seeded about 69,000 native plants over 111 acres. Between 2025 and 2027, they expect to plant an additional 130,000 over 250 acres. 
Parry said with $13 million in funding that’s already been secured, they’ve made good progress — but he said tribal leaders continue to ask for donations since “we’re always looking for funding,” especially for monitoring the project’s impact on the ecosystem. 
“Another $5 to $10 million wouldn’t hurt,” he said.

State Prison dates back to 1836 and has tiny cells with no hot water, privacy, or air conditioning, a new report says.","Some wings in the oldest portions of the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton date back nearly 200 years. The smallest cells, like the one pictured, measure four by seven feet. (Photo courtesy of New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson)Over a century ago, New Jersey corrections officials and advocates called on lawmakers to demolish and replace the state prison in Trenton, declaring the facility outdated, inadequate, and “wholly unsuited for the present needs either of the inmates or of the officers.”
Lawmakers did not act on that 1918 call to action or several subsequent pleas for change, and today, more than 1,300 people are incarcerated in New Jersey State Prison — considered the oldest operating prison in America, with one section built in 1836, according to a new watchdog report.
Now the state corrections ombudsperson’s office has joined the chorus urging lawmakers to raze and rebuild the maximum-security lockup’s oldest wings, where people have spent decades in closet-sized cells with no hot water, no privacy, no recreation space or day room, and such sweltering temperatures in the summer that many sleep on the floor to stay cool.
“Hundreds of people are living in the prison’s West Compound in cells small enough that they can extend their arms and touch both side-walls and the ceiling,” state Ombudsperson Terry Schuster wrote in a report released Tuesday. “The buildings in the West Compound were constructed nearly 200 years ago, and have been called antiquated and inhumane by New Jersey correctional leaders, policymakers, and subject matter experts for at least the last 100 years.”
Department spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
While two of the prison’s three compounds were built in the 1980s with modern temperature control and housing unit design, its west compound has seven housing units that were built between 1836 and 1905, according to the report. The compound’s smallest cells measure just four feet by seven feet, and its oldest housing units were designed for solitary confinement, the report says.
More than 600 people live there, with over a third of its general-population residents serving life sentences, according to the report.
Kory McClary, who has lived at the prison since 2013, described the cells in the west compound as “cages for rotting men” in a 2024 essay.
Living there is “like living in an abandoned building,” he wrote. “I’m in a single cell about the size of a small walk-in closet — half the size of the cells in the south compound. With my books and coolers strewn around the cell, I only get two steps into my pacing before I have to turn around. The windows rattle, creak and swing back and forth when the wind blows. Guys holler all day.”

Investigators noted that officials have repeatedly urged lawmakers to replace the prison’s oldest portions.
After prison riots in 1952, a committee held public hearings and issued a report to then-Gov. Alfred Driscoll that denounced the prison as “one of the most archaic in the United States” and exhorted lawmakers to build a new facility rather than taking “piecemeal and temporary measures to stave off the ravages of old age,” the report says.
It was slated for demolition at least twice before. Its end was so expected in the 1980s that preservationists photographed the building for historic building archives, the report says. And in 2011, the Department of Corrections sought state funds to demolish and rebuild it, citing class-action litigation over confinement conditions and warning that inaction would compromise security and force officials “to maintain the old systems at extremely high costs.”
“Maintaining the West Compound of the prison has required immense effort on the part of the facility’s staff and leadership over the last century-plus, and has cost New Jersey taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,” Schuster wrote.
Schuster urged lawmakers and department officials to prioritize and fund the demolition and reconstruction of the west compound. Past estimates for such work have ranged from $200 million to $400 million, he added. Absent that, officials should relocate west compound residents to safer, more modern housing units, Schuster recommended.
Lawmakers also should adopt standards for the size of single- and double-occupancy cells to ensure prison conditions are humane, Schuster said. He noted that the state’s administrative code regulates the size of county jail cells, requiring a minimum of 35 square feet of free floor space in a single-occupancy cell, yet has no minimum standard for the size of state prison cells.
He also recommended that department officials create more privacy in the compound’s showers and provide residents with free, standard-size bath towels, instead of the smaller towels they now get. Prison staff told Schuster’s investigators that many residents bathe in their underwear for privacy in a washroom that has just small dividers between showering spaces.
Corrections officials have closed a number of state prisons in recent years, including Jones Farm in Ewing and Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont. Officials also plan to close the East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge and the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women in Clinton.
Like New Jersey State Prison’s west compound, though, the state has stumbled and stalled in its efforts to close other abhorred lockups, including two prisons for juveniles.

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — Robert Cheeks cast a ballot in Birmingham’s municipal elections last week and received a standing ovation from poll workers.
It was the first time that Cheeks, 82, had voted. Until the most recent election, his criminal history barred him from participating in the electoral process.
“I had never voted before and it was always my wish to vote,” he said after he cast his ballot. “I had the opportunity, encouraged, to vote, and I said I want to exercise my right as a citizen in the state, and I wanted to vote because I had never voted before.”

For Black Alabamians like Cheeks who have criminal convictions, getting the right to vote restored can be difficult, according to a new report from Return My Vote, an organization that assists people with criminal convictions with regaining their right to vote.
The study, “Alabama’s Moral Turpitude Law Disproportionately Strips Black Citizens of Their Voting Rights,” found that Black Alabamians were four times more likely to lose their right to vote than white Alabamians.
“The most basic, and most important, finding is that overall that people who were dropped from the voter file or denied registration due to felony conviction, a majority of them were Black,” said Richard Fording, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama and a co-author of the study. “Not a large majority, but over 50% of them were Black. It was about twice the percentage of the general population that is Black in Alabama, and so, of course that is alarming.”
Alabama laws generally deny the vote to those convicted of crimes of moral turpitude, a broad phrase that was subject to interpretation until the state began listing specific crimes under it in 2017. While some states automatically restore voting rights after a person completes a sentence, Alabama has a more complicated process.
While only a handful of crimes can permanently cost a person their vote, some require pardons from the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles. Others require a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote once they have completed their sentence, which includes payment of any fines, fees and restitution.
The authors of the study studied 25,000 people removed from the voter rolls or disqualified from voting between 2017 and 2020 due to criminal conviction. Study authors were able to review the information only after the Campaign Legal Center had obtained the records after a federal judge had required the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office to release it.
Disparities
According to the study, Black men were disenfranchised at a rate of 22.4 citizens per 1,000 men of voting age. That is almost four times the rate for their white counterparts, whose rate was 6.7 citizens per 1,000.
The rate for disenfranchising Black women was 3.9 citizens per 1,000, almost twice the rate of white women, whose disenfranchisement rate was 2.1 citizens per 1,000 white women.
Counties with significant Black populations had some of the highest Black disenfranchisement rates and largest racial disparities in disenfranchisement. Seven of the 10 counties with the highest rates of disenfranchised voters are within the Black Belt. The rate for disenfranchising Black men in Monroe, more than 40% Black, was 40.6, compared to 8 per 1,000 for white men. In Perry County, with a Black population of 70%, the rate was 30 citizens per 1,000 Black men of voting age. The rate was 11.4 for white men, almost three times lower.
The disparities are less pronounced for women in the same counties, but they still exist. In Monroe County, Black women are disenfranchised at a rate of 5.6 citizens per 1,000 Black women who are at least 18 years old. For white women in that county, the rate is 2.4, less than half.
Study authors stated in the report that even though there is some uncertainty with the information because of problems collecting data, after reviewing the Uniform Crime Report data obtained from the FBI website, the findings indicated that more Blacks are disenfranchised than whites even when criminal convictions are considered.
“Nevertheless, the most important takeaway is that the disproportionate percentage of arrests for disqualifying offenses by Blacks in Alabama (42%) cannot fully account for the significantly higher percentage of Blacks disenfranchised by the state (52%) during 2017-2021,” the report states.
The study also found that Blacks have a more difficult time regaining their right to vote after they are removed from the voter rolls after getting convicted of a crime.
Authors also investigated the number of people who were removed from the voter rolls from 2017-2021 who had regained their voting rights and registered to vote once again by 2024. According to the study, 1,034 people who are Black reregistered to vote after they completed their sentence, about 8.3% of the total. That is less than the almost 13% of whites registered to vote after a criminal conviction.
The study suggested that the disparities could stem from disparities in the application of Alabama’s felony disenfranchisement law and uneven methods of voter file maintenance in the state.
“Regardless of the reason, the significant variation in county-level disenfranchisement rates calls for further investigation into how Alabama’s felony disenfranchisement law is being implemented at the local level,” the report said. “This is especially important given federal law that requires uniform implementation of state election laws across counties.”
‘It means so much’
Cheeks spent almost 40 years in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections after receiving a mandatory life sentence in 1985 for a robbery. Cheeks had prior convictions of forgery and assault, leading to the sentence but no one was physically injured. Cheeks spent 30 years working in the kitchen at Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer without pay, according to Alabama Appleseed.
Cheeks was released in July 2022. His criminal convictions required him to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote, which he applied for and received from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles. Cheeks, with the help of supporters, then registered to vote with the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County and acquired full citizenship once again after spending nearly four decades incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
“It is more important now than it would have been in the first place,” Cheeks said of voting. “I have been so anxious over the years to vote. I have been hearing so much about voting, and I wanted to express my opportunity for the right to vote. It is granted to American citizens by right, and I wanted to do that. I am so thankful. It is a blessing, and it means so much.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Robert-Cheeks-for-Sept-2-2025.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

The awards honor excellence in digital journalism around the world.


CalMatters is a finalist for general excellence and social media engagement amongst medium-sized newsrooms in the 2025 Online News Awards.
In each size category, ONA’s general excellence award “honors a digitally focused news organization that successfully fulfills its editorial mission, effectively serves its audience, maximizes the use of digital tools and platforms and represents the highest journalistic standards.”
CalMatters is a finalist for general excellence along with ProPublica, Mother Jones/Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune. CalMatters’ honor is for work, including our nonpartisan voter information efforts, groundbreaking Digital Democracy platform and every day coverage helping millions of people make sense of California and how its government works.

Our stories and tools made government actions and decisions relatable, held leaders accountable and gave Californians vital information to engage with their government – resulting in impacts felt across the state. In journalism, impact can take seconds or it can take years. When it comes to big issues we bring persistent, accountability coverage, and this year, we’ve seen that result in widespread impact: a California state audit (triggered by a 2023 CalMatters investigation) found that a law meant to reveal who funds state legislators’ sponsored travel is falling short, state legislators advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight (directly citing an ongoing CalMatters investigation on conditions inside homeless shelters), and California’s political watchdog fined a former lawmaker $106,000 for campaign finance violations (after a 2020 CalMatters story). This is only a fraction of the impact we’ve had.
Our Voter Guide has been a powerhouse resource that has helped Californians figure out how they want to vote. This year, we reached our widest audience thus far, by meeting voters where they were. We created TikTok videos and filters, launched an interactive ballot preview tool, partnered with local publications to show readers articles relevant to their ballot, created magazine-style quizzes that hundreds of Californians used at 40+ in-person events, printed a Voter Guide zine, added Chinese and Korean translations in addition to Spanish, and a version for English learners. One in five California voters used our guide.
Our Digital Democracy platform, launched in 2024, shows video and transcripts from every hearing, logs every vote, provides data on lobbyists and an easy way to track bills. We’ve also trained journalists in 20+ newsrooms on how to use our AI-generated tipsheets. With the help of our tipsheets, CBS News partnered with us to reveal that California’s one-party supermajority legislature systematically avoids transparency and accountability by killing controversial legislation without voting on the record. Digital Democracy has two Emmy nominations and won the Poynter Institute’s Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation.  

CalMatters is a finalist for social media engagement among National Geographic, The Marshall Project and The Baltimore Banner. CalMatters’ honor is for our nonpartisan Voter Guide TikTok engagement efforts.

Made-for-Gen Z TikToks: We experimented a lot, failing multiple times before we found our first viral success when we started breaking down California propositions using a call center format. Our Gen Z politics reporter, Jenna Peterson, and our millennial audience engagement manager, Anna Almendrala worked hand-in-hand, creating skits where Jenna played both a confused voter, and a call center prop expert. TikTokers started paying attention, and we kept going, making and trying out organic ways to reach young voters on TikTok.
Launching our own TikTok filter: Like in previous elections, we created online interactive quizzes that helped California voters figure out where they stood on each of the statewide propositions. But in 2024, after being inspired by lighthearted beauty industry TikTok filters that asked viewers to vote for makeup by tilting their heads, we created a series of CalMatters TikTok filters asking you if you thought the rent was too damn high — and other similar questions — that could help TikTokers decide how they’d vote on the state’s ballot propositions this year. (Our demo.) Our quiz filters were used over 20,000 times in the two weeks before the election.
Working with California influencers: For the first time ever, CalMatters worked with influencers to help make sure our voter guide reached young voters on TikTok. We selected six influencers based on common criteria — they were in California, they normally posted lifestyle videos, and they thought of young adults as one of their main audiences. We also asked them to clearly disclose that CalMatters was sponsoring their post, to create videos in their own voice, and to tell their audience about our voter guide.

While some winners in the Online News Awards have already been announced, winners for general excellence and social media engagement will be announced in September at the Online News Association’s conference in New Orleans.
Last year, CalMatters was also a finalist for general excellence; and The Markup, which is also part of our news organization, won the same category for small newsrooms.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060120_CalMattersStaff_LV__008-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

I’m going to go with a dark horse candidate: the mid-19th century.
This may seem an odd choice when the Black Death and the Thirty Years’ War are on the shelf. The people of those times would have loved the technologies that made goods more plentiful and travel easier during the Victorian era.

But those cravat-wearing, girdle-trapped train passengers carried viruses and bacteria to populations with no immunity to them. The factories that made those goods triggered explosive growth in cities, far beyond society’s ability to manage the sanitation problems that resulted.
Children bore the brunt of this calamity. Infant mortality rates were horrifically high and even higher if you were poor, Black or Native American. Life expectancy as a whole fell in the first half of the 19th century. Many of those who survived adolescence experienced stunted growth or carried health problems for the rest of their lives. According to “Health and Wellness in 19th Century America” by John C. Waller, a soldier in the Civil War was, on average, an inch shorter than a soldier who served in World War II and an inch shorter than a soldier who served in the American Revolution.
I wouldn’t want to live in 1750, but when it comes to public health, I might prefer it to 1850. Progress is neither preordained nor secure from reversals. And we have examples of this in our own lifetime.
Take measles. The first vaccine against the disease hit the market in 1963. The MMR shot – the one most of us over the age of 20 got – came along in 1971. Both these vaccines were safe and effective against a disease that once killed 2 million people around the world each year. In 2000, authorities declared measles eliminated in the United States.
But that didn’t last.
A fraudulent study falsely linking vaccines to autism — which is not a disease — led to people forsaking the shot and empowered all kinds of con artists to attack science and scientists. In the first three months of 2025, the United States had more reported measles cases than in all 2024.
Now measles has reached Alabama.
The Alabama Department of Public Health reported last week that a 5-year-old child tested positive for the disease, the first confirmed case of measles in the state in over 20 years.
But it won’t take another 20 years to see the second case. Health care experts say we need 95% vaccine coverage to prevent the spread of measles. Alabama’s rate among kindergarteners was 95.2% last year.  That’s good because it was 93.8% the year before, setting off alarm bells at the health department. Yearly swings like these are becoming common and will only endanger children.
Facing these risks, we need political leaders who listen to health care experts; take disease seriously and rebuke the charlatans putting families in danger.
Here’s what we have now.
For the last several years, Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, has pushed legislation to expand Alabamians’ ability to claim “religious exemptions” from vaccinations. These exemptions are largely anti-vaxxer nonsense. Few, if any, religions ban their adherents from getting vaccinated.
Orr’s bill passed the Senate this spring. It failed to move in the House. But Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, has already prefiled a new version of the bill for next year’s session. (It would allow college students to claim the same exemption, a perfect way to spread disease among stressed-out people living in tight quarters.)
Then there’s our allegedly inevitable next governor. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville has suggested mandatory vaccinations in the Armed Forces hurt recruitment. Because nothing says military readiness more than a bunch of sick soldiers.
Last December, the Republican appeared to signal agreement with now-U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that babies were getting too many vaccines. He followed that up during Kennedy’s confirmation hearing earlier this year with an announcement that his granddaughter wouldn’t be “a pincushion.”
There’s Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, now a candidate for U.S. Senate, who falsely claimed in 2022 that the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective. His opponent in the Republican primary, U.S. Rep. Barry Moore, appears to agree with Tuberville’s make-’em-sick approach to national defense, demanding in a 2021 letter to the U.S. Department of Defense that service members not get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Here’s your future, Alabama. A bunch of leaders captured by the virus lobby.
I hope this poor 5-year-old who caught measles recovers. I hope it doesn’t spread. The severe respiratory illness and rash is miserable even when it’s not deadly.
But when we get our second measles case, will we have a government acting to protect us? Or will our politicians watch children get ill — or worse — and mumble something about freedom?
All the evidence points to the latter. And an Alabama political class inexplicably undoing decades of public health gains.
This may not be the Victorian era. But unlike us, the Victorians didn’t choose to live in a world where children needlessly died.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/19th-century-illustration-of-illness-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

This story was originally reported by Nadra Nittle of The 19th.  Meet Nadra and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Second-grade teacher Demetria Richardson spends so much on school supplies she has a designated credit card to cover classroom expenses. Just don’t tell her husband what the balance is, she said. Usually, the 26-year veteran educator in Richmond, Virginia, spends about $500 on back-to-school items. Over the past month, she has already topped that — and she’s not done shopping.
Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that lets individuals fund public school classroom projects, helps Richardson cover some of the costs on items like dry erase markers, pencils and printer ink. The school supply-stuffed backpacks that local churches distribute to families before the school year also help, Richardson said. Yet, none of this assistance stretches far enough to prevent teachers like her from dipping into their own wallets to serve students.
While covering the cost of classroom supplies is a challenge educators face annually, the burden on them has grown as the price of many learning materials has jumped by 20 percent in roughly five years.

“By the end of September,” Richardson estimated, the total on her credit card for school is “probably going to be close to $1,200.”
President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods — and the supply chain disruptions that resulted — have partly been blamed for driving up the cost of school supplies. His freeze of over $6 billion in education funding on July 1, which he reversed before the end of that month, added to the problem by preventing schools, including Title I schools with large populations of economically disadvantaged students, from stocking classrooms with learning materials well ahead of the academic year.
“It’s hard to understand that teachers have to buy all these supplies for themselves, for their classrooms and for students,” said Emma García, principal researcher for the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit that conducts research to improve education policy and practice. “I don’t think there’s any other profession in which the professional has to shoulder the supplies or the materials. But for teachers, it’s taken for granted that they will be there, that they are going to do the work no matter what.”
Research indicates that virtually no educators are spared from spending their own money on their classrooms, according to García. Teachers at high-poverty schools told The 19th that, in addition to Trump’s tariffs and funding freeze, other factors have contributed to them paying more for goods. They pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, when they saw prices start to rise and a cultural and economic shift in which students returned to class with few to no supplies, a trend they say persists today.
“This year has definitely been a huge challenge because typically the schools would be able to give us some of the basics, like a stapler, pencils, paper,” said Emmanuela Louis, who teaches English Language Arts for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. School officials “haven’t been able to give us anything, so it’s like we have to rely heavily on DonorsChoose to even get resources for the kids to start the school year. It pretty much puts the most vulnerable kids at risk.”
Through it all, teachers have served as the safety net children can count on when the system breaks down. Educators have taken on debt, found extra work and gone without much-needed personal items to prepare their classrooms — and their students — for another school year.

The person sacrifices behind school supplies

For Richardson, shelling out hundreds of dollars of her own money on school supplies means she won’t be able to buy the $150 pair of stylish Vionic orthopedic shoes that make it easier for her to stand all day.
“People think that we don’t like to look nice, too,” Richardson said. “We want to get a new back-to-school outfit, too, or a pair of shoes. But when it comes to our students, our students come first, and we go on the back burner.”
Louis knows the feeling: Some years she has barely been able to afford back-to-school footwear and apparel herself. During others, she has gone without these items entirely because she had funneled so much money into her classroom at Jose De Diego Middle School in Miami. Although her district provides her with a $300 school supply stipend, a purchase as mundane as copy paper devours those funds instantly, she said.
“Three hundred dollars doesn’t go far at all,” said Louis, who has taught for 16 years. “When you’re thinking of supplies — folders and things like that — they’re not cheap. You’re buying at least three folders per student just to keep their items organized. Paper is also a necessity to copy things for them. We do have laptops, which kind of helps, but they don’t always go home with them, so they definitely need tangible items in their hands to write and copy things down.”
Altogether, Louis estimates that during any given school year, she spends about $2,500 to $3,000 on her classroom and students. And that doesn’t include the money the mother of two spends on supplies for her own children, a third-grader and a ninth-grader.
Richardson’s classroom expenditures aren’t far behind, as she has spent as much as $2,000 outfitting her classroom at Henry L. Marsh III Elementary in Richmond throughout the school year. That’s well above the average educators spend on supplies, DonorsChoose has found, backing up previous research that revealed teachers at high-needs schools have more out-of-pocket expenses.
“We ran a teacher survey earlier this spring, and we noticed that teachers are spending, on average, $655 of their own money on school supplies for their students and for their classroom,” said Kristina “Steen” Joye Lyles, vice president of equity and impact at DonorsChoose. “That’s an increase from what teachers reported last year, which was $610.”
Without DonorsChoose, Lyles said, teachers reported that they’d be spending over $1,400 of their own money on school supplies annually. “So, this is a trend that we’re watching closely.”
García said paying for school supplies compounds financial pressures for teachers, who earn lower salaries compared with professionals in other careers that require college or graduate degrees. Moreover, teachers often take on student loan debt just to enter the field. Given this, any out-of-pocket costs are “going to be more burdensome for a teacher than for a non-teacher” covering work-related expenses, García contends. And the $300 deduction for classroom expenditures educators can claim on federal income tax returns hardly levels the playing field.
Richardson has felt obligated to subsidize her students’ needs with her own money because she teaches at a Title I school where nearly every pupil qualifies for free or reduced lunch. Some years, most of her classroom expenses have gone toward snacks for students.
“Some parents send their own snacks, but we do have a lot of kids whose parents don’t, so we hate to see them sitting there needing that extra boost of energy but not having it,” she said. “You’re talking about snacks for maybe 20 kids, five times a week. That does add up.”
Also adding up is the rising cost of school supplies. This year, Richardson has paid more for crayons, glue sticks, composition books, folders and other materials than she remembers paying in recent years.
“I used to get folders for 50 cents apiece,” she said. “Now they’re almost 95 cents a folder. We used to be able to get boxes of crayons, but we can’t get them in bulk at the dollar store anymore. They said supply is low. Now, they’re like almost $2 for a 16-count box.”










I used to get folders for 50 cents apiece. Now they're almost 95 cents a folder. We used to be able to get boxes of crayons, but we can't get them in bulk at the dollar store anymore. They said supply is low. Now, they're like almost $2 for a 16-count box.


– Demetria Richardson, Virginia educator


Louis can no longer afford to give each of her 125 students a small box of crayons, along with a kit filled with rulers, index cards and highlighters. This year, she said, groups of four students will have to share these school supply kits. Sharing them means that her students can’t take the kits home to complete their schoolwork.
Since her students are required to wear uniforms consisting of polo shirts and navy or khaki pants, Louis has also spent her own money to make sure her sixth graders, many of whom come from migrant families who can’t afford more than one uniform, have multiple sets of these clothing items.
“The uniforms have gone up tremendously,” she said. “It used to cost $6 or $7 for a shirt. Now they’re between $9 to $12.”
As classes resumed in Richmond, Richardson had already spent $200 on composition books and $400 on durable headphones for her students that wouldn’t break like the cheap ones she had in her classroom last school year. New whiteboards and dry erase markers were also on her list.
A mother of four — the youngest of which is a college senior in need of her own supplies — Richardson said she’s fortunate enough to have children who pitch in to help her obtain learning materials.
“They always say, ‘Hey, Mom, I picked up some crayons for you,’ or ‘Mom, I picked up some pencils. Mom, you always said the kids never have scissors,’” Richardson said. “I’m so blessed that they do look out for me.”

The empty backpack: A post-COVID reality

Reflecting on the start of her teaching career, which coincided with the turn of the 21st century, Richardson noticed a stark difference compared with today in how parents respond to the annual supply list her school sends out.
“Earlier in my career, parents would send everything on the school supply list, and then they would send extras just in case,” she said. “If your tissue box supply ran low, you could reach out and they would replenish it.”
Today, however, students will get free bookbags from community events and bring nothing more than the bag and the supplies in it — usually one notebook, one pack of paper, one box of crayons — to school with them, Richardson said.
“If we’re lucky, that’s what they have,” she said.
Out of 125 students, Louis said that she expects “maybe not even 20 percent” to show up to school with the supplies they need. That’s about 25 students.
The COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point, ushering in mass job losses and supply chain disruptions that made it difficult for families to pay for essentials like rent and food, let alone school supplies. When students returned to class after remote learning, many stopped bringing the items on supply lists, teachers told The 19th.
“So we tried to minimize what was on the list to be just the necessities,” Richardson said.
At her high-poverty school, most students show up with half the supplies on the back-to-school list, while about a quarter arrive completely empty-handed, she said. Some parents question why students need items like resealable plastic baggies, dry-erase markers or hand sanitizer, so they don’t purchase them. Others just haven’t been able to find items on the supply list, like the clear or mesh book bags required since July 2024 by Richmond Public Schools.
To supplement her income and easily provide her students with the appropriate learning materials, Richardson has in the past taken on extra work — teaching summer school and working as a tutor and facilitator. Doing so, she said, gave her “extra money all year round to offset what I spend in my classroom.” A DonorsChoose survey revealed that nearly half of teachers report having a second job.
“So, again, we’re just seeing this heightened level of teachers going above and beyond to be able to stay afloat during a time when things are getting really expensive,” Lyles said.
Jodi Hanauer, an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) teacher at Juniata Park Academy in Philadelphia, has previously picked up more work, which, in part, helped her buy school supplies.
“I took on a part-time job just to pay the bills for several years,” the 22-year educator said. “I was an online ESOL teacher at night and during the weekends. I was teaching kids and adults English in countries like China, Japan and [places like] Hong Kong.”
The extra income she earned then marked the rare time buying school supplies, for which Hanauer pays between $500 to $1,000 annually, didn’t hurt financially. Like Louis, her school district provides her with a small stipend to cover learning materials, but the $200 doesn’t begin to compensate for the expenditures she makes working at a high-poverty school.
Title I funds from the federal government help schools with economically disadvantaged students to cover supply costs.  But Trump’s funding freeze in July held up Title I funding, delaying schools from getting their supply orders processed well before the new academic year.
“We haven’t been able to receive the order for this school year yet, so we’re hoping that will get cleared up soon,” Richardson said.

A stopgap, not a solution: the limits of crowdfunding

DonorsChoose helps teachers like Richardson avoid financial collapse.
She’s currently seeking donations for basic school supplies like pencils and ink for the classroom printer. She’d also like clay to help her students do classroom projects that develop their fine motor skills.
But DonorsChoose, Richardson said, is not a permanent solution to the long-standing pattern of teachers covering school supplies.
“It takes a while for the projects to be funded and then the materials to be shipped to us,” she said. “If we need poster boards for our students to do a history project, and we need them in the classroom on Friday, I have to go out and purchase 18 poster boards to make sure that all of my students have one.”
For Hanauer, DonorsChoose is no guarantee she will get all the school supplies she needs. She currently has a campaign to give prizes — which have previously included fidget spinners and high-end pens, pencils and erasers — to students who make positive behavioral choices.
“Putting up a DonorsChoose project is like a dream,” she said. “You are dreaming of getting things, and it’s great if that happens, but if you absolutely need something now or in one week, then you’re going to have to come up with the money yourself.”
For 12 years, Louis has used DonorsChoose to subsidize her classroom expenses. Since many of her students are English learners, it’s imperative that her classroom be a print-rich environment. But educational posters can cost $35 apiece, an expense that can quickly balloon. Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose has helped her cut down on these costs. She’s also used the site to fund field trips. She’s currently crowdfunding for a file cabinet and poster machine ink that can cost up to $500.
Although teachers make countless sacrifices to kick off the school year and maintain their classrooms as the months unfold, Louis knows that the public is largely unaware of how much educators personally contribute to school supply lists. Every item in a classroom, she said, has been designed with one goal in mind: facilitating student learning.
“So, please be gentle with teachers,” she asked, urging families to provide any learning materials they’re capable of buying. Teachers who pour money into their classrooms, she said,  do so “out of the kindness of our heart, because we really enjoy what we do.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Child-with-school-supplies-for-Aug-31-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

Wes Moore vowed to end child poverty, he likely did not expect his efforts to face twice-impeached former President Donald Trump's return to the White House to begin what critics are calling a “War on Children,” writes Thomas Ferraro.","Gov. Wes Moore, right, vowed at the outset of his term to end child poverty, but that pledge has run into the reality of budget cuts by President Donald Trump that critics say with hit the poorest Americans. (President Donald Trump from a White House screen shot; Gov. Wes Moore photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)On Feb. 1, 2023, Gov. Wes Moore (D), in his first state-of-the-state address, promised to make Maryland the first state to end child poverty. “Maryland will lead the way,” Moore said.
The new governor likely never imagined that twice-impeached former President Donald Trump would return to the White House this year and begin what critics call a “War on Children” – widespread federal spending cuts that threaten to push more children into poverty nationwide.
In July, Moore made a new promise, saying, “I am prepared to use every tool at my disposal … to protect our people and minimize the fallout from these reckless policies.”
Moore campaigned for governor in 2022 with the slogan, “Leave no one behind.” He now uses it as a rallying cry to support those who might be hurt by Trump cuts.
An estimated 174,000 Marylanders are at risk of losing food assistance, and 144,000 Marylanders may lose health coverage from Medicaid cuts, according to the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group.
Ben Orr, the center’s chief executive officer, writes: “While the numbers alone are staggering, behind those numbers are real people – parents who won’t be able to afford enough food for themselves and their children, families becoming homeless because they had to spend limited funds on healthcare or food instead of rent.”

In 2023, the most recent year with available data, there were about 142,000 Maryland children in poverty, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a philanthropy dedicated to improving the lives of children. The state’s child poverty rate stood at 11%, the national rate at 16%.
Poverty is complex, which helps explain why no state has ended it. Factors include low wages, lack of affordable housing, rising costs and underfunded government programs for the poor.
In seeking to boost the economy and reduce federal “fraud, waste, and abuse,” Trump slashed grants, programs, departments, and agencies, many of which serve children, and fired tens of thousands of workers, many of them parents.
On July 3, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” packed with spending and tax cuts — shifting wealth from the poor to the rich, from young to older — won final congressional approval, prompting him to declare, “it’s going to make this country into a rocket ship” economically.
Moore fired back that no state has the resources to “fill the massive hole” that Trump’s measure will put in “our social safety net.” In June, he told WUSA-9 that proposed cuts in food stamps, Medicaid and education would “push about 76,000 of our children, our children, into poverty. And it’s all being done so we can give millionaires a tax cut!”
In his 2023 state-of-the-state speech, Moore said, “No group deserves our help more than the children of Maryland. In a state with the highest median income in the country, one in eight children lives in poverty.”
“I know there will be skeptics,” said Moore, a former head one of the nation’s largest anti-poverty organizations.  But, he said, “We can, and we will, end child poverty in the state of Maryland.”
Moore moved quickly on several fronts, including affordable housing, raising the state minimum wage, expanding the state child tax credit and earned income tax credit, and launching The ENOUGH Act – Engaging Neighborhoods, Organizations, Unions, Governments and Households – an effort to end concentrated child poverty while constructing strong communities.
Orr says the governor “made a lot of progress” on child poverty in his first two years in office, though he now faces new challenges with Trump cuts atop a state budget deficit.
Due to those cuts, Orr says, “I certainly expect, when the data is in on the next couple of years, we will see an increase in child poverty in Maryland and the various ways harm is being done to Maryland families.”
Children are among the most vulnerable, given that those in poverty are less apt to graduate high school, and thus more likely to face joblessness, homelessness and other life problems, impacting their children and possibly grandchildren.
A month after taking office, Moore told Baltimore’s WYPR public radio, “I hope we can make enough of a dent” in child poverty in his first term “to justify” reelection, and then, during a second term, which would begin in 2027, push toward finishing the job.
Moore’s efforts in a second term may get a boost from the fact that Trump’s second term is set to end on Jan. 20, 2029, and, with it, perhaps, an end to a “War on Children.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/merged-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt / Source NM)Moriarty Police Chief Adan Urbina and one of his officers, Christopher Costa, spent the summer of 2023 taking inventory of everything in their evidence room. The pair began the tedious work of inspecting and cataloging the boxes of seized possessions after Cpt. Mark Satterfield, the lone evidence custodian for this small police force some 40 miles east of Albuquerque, submitted his notice of resignation that June. Lifting the box of evidence for a January 2023 criminal case off its shelf, Urbina and Costa couldn’t find the seized cash that was supposed to be inside. Urbina called off the inventory effort, records show, and decided to intercept Satterfield, who was scheduled to clean out his office, the next day.
Investigative documents show that Urbina asked Satterfield about the missing money. Satterfield assured him that the cash was “safe” and “still on city property” and promised he would take the chief to see it the following day. As promised, the next afternoon Satterfield arrived at the chief’s office and told him the missing money was “All the way on the east end of town,” police reports say. He told the chief he moved the money because he was afraid that someone might tamper with evidence to “destroy his career.” Urbina pressed Satterfield — was there any other evidence missing?
“Satterfield emphatically responded, ‘No,’” according to a police report.
Urbina and Costa got in a car and followed Satterfield two miles to the city’s Fire Department Training Center. Satterfield put his car in park and opened the door to step out. He began walking “directly to one of the training containers” — a building that resembles a mobile home and can withstand flames to give firefighters accurate training scenarios — “on the west side of the property,” according to a police investigation. “Just as MPD Chief Urbina reached the entrance to the container, Satterfield emerged carrying what appeared to be a plastic bag containing what appeared to be an envelope. Satterfield handed the evidence bag over to MPD Chief Urbina. Satterfield stated that ‘more than a thousand (dollars)’ were in the evidence bag. When pressed about how many cases this money was from, Satterfield became flustered and could not provide a coherent response.”

 

Earlier this year, Satterfield was charged with embezzlement and tampering with evidence, both of which are felonies. He is awaiting trial. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
Satterfield is one of two law enforcement officers included on a “Brady List” by the Seventh Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which oversees prosecution for Socorro, Torrance, Sierra and Catron counties. The lists are named after two U.S. Supreme Court cases — Brady v. Maryland (1963) and Giglio v. U.S. (1972) — that directed prosecutors to disclose any material that could prove to be exculpatory to the defense or that could cast doubt on the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses. These lists are maintained internally by prosecutors’ offices across the nation and serve as guideposts for which police officers, sheriff’s deputies and state troopers are suspected to have credibility problems and, therefore, could tank a case if prosecutors rely too heavily on their testimony.

 In the files pertaining to Satterfield’s case, deputies with the Torrance County Sheriff’s Office included an aerial photograph of the firefighter training facility where he allegedly stashed cash from his department’s evidence room. (Courtesy of Torrance County Sheriff’s Office)
Searchlight New Mexico requested copies of these lists, as well as supporting “Giglio disclosures” that explain why a DA’s office sometimes decides to question a given cop’s credibility, from each of the 14 DA’s offices in the state. Nine, including those that cover the state’s most populous areas in Albuquerque, Las Cruces and Santa Fe, responded in full. Two said they did not have any responsive records. Three did not respond.
There is seemingly no single, standardized format for tabulating and storing these records in New Mexico. Custodians in each of these offices keep these documents in different ways. In some district attorney’s offices, the internal documents clearly spell out which cops they do not want to call on for testimony — and why. In others, officers are listed as “potential” concerns that should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In yet others, prosecutors maintain folders of documents that include correspondence with an officer’s or deputy’s supervisors, who review an officer’s personnel file and then inform the local prosecutors of any red flags contained therein.
For instance, the DA in Bernalillo County — which publishes the names of Brady List officers on its public website — gave Searchlight supporting documentation such as emails and correspondence that shed light on internal investigations into several officers’ conduct. The Third Judicial District Attorney’s Office provided Searchlight with a two-page document titled, “Potential Giglio Officers,” with officers’ employers and brief notes from prosecutors as to why each one may be a risk to put on the stand.
Other offices did not give Searchlight a list. The Seventh Judicial District Attorney’s Office did not provide any internal memos or correspondence that shed light on how prosecutors view the reported conduct of these officers. It did, however, provide police reports, court documents and other information that explain why they are on the office’s Brady list.
In response to Searchlight’s request, the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office shared a spreadsheet with the names of each officer on its Brady List, as well as one line to explain their inclusion. The spreadsheet did not readily identify which law enforcement agency each officer and deputy works or worked for. Through reviews of court records and news reports, Searchlight has been able to identify many of them.
Searchlight has used these documents to identify nearly 100 current and former sworn police officers and sheriff’s deputies who have been deemed as a cause for concern by prosecuting attorneys. That figure is likely an undercount as several DA’s offices in the state did not provide any documents. In some cases, internal memos show, a given officer’s testimony could cast serious doubt on the prosecution’s case because of their discipline history. In others, prosecutors call officers a “potential” cause for concern but stop short of calling them altogether untrustworthy.
The law enforcement officers whose conduct has been called into question range from Las Cruces to Santa Fe, from Hobbs to Socorro. They face allegations ranging from embezzlement and tampering with evidence to domestic violence and child pornography. Many have been terminated, reprimanded or, in extreme cases, sentenced to prison. Others have left for jobs with new departments. Roswell Police Chief Lance Bateman, for instance, told Searchlight that none of the Roswell Police Department officers identified on the list still work for the city.
Below, see, in their own words, how local prosecutors and leaders in police departments and sheriff’s offices across the state refer to these law enforcement agents and their conduct. An officer’s listed department reflects where they worked at the time of inclusion on a local DA’s list. Many of their comments are presented in their entirety — edits were made only for length.

(Photo courtesy NReal Media Strategies)One advocacy group is jumping into Nevada’s 2026 endorsement cycle early with the hope of reversing the battleground state’s recent swing toward electing candidates with weaker records on protecting reproductive rights.
Abortion was seen as a key issue in the 2022 midterm elections, which took place months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v Wade and largely brought wins for Democrats. Many expected the issue to be a deciding factor for voters in 2024, but Donald Trump’s ascent into a second presidential term, and Republicans taking control of both the House and Senate, raised doubts about that narrative.
“We learned the hard way in 2024,” said Reproductive Freedom for All President and CEO Mini Timmaraju, in an interview with the Nevada Current, conceding there were voters they took for granted.
Reproductive Freedom for All exit polls and focus groups held in the aftermath of last year’s election found that many voters simply did not believe Trump would actually attempt to ban or restrict abortion. Democrats in the lead up to the election had flagged this “Trump believability gap” as a problem on myriad issues.
Their research also found that Trump did better among voters who were not familiar with his positions on abortion.
“When Trump said he was going to ‘leave it to the states,’ it gave a permission structure for voters who were conflicted,” Timmaraju said.
She added, “I will give him and his campaign credit for successfully inoculating Democrats at the presidential level by continually showing message discipline.”
Voters could feel empowered to vote for Trump while also supporting abortion rights protections, like those proposed in Nevada’s Question 6, because they saw abortion as something out of the purview of a president, or as protected at the state level, or as something Congress would never rally the votes for.
Timmaraju sees it as voters being swayed by misinformation because the actions taken by the Trump administration since he took office should make it clear that the issue isn’t being left to the states. But voters need to hear the message.
“We have to get in front of them, and we have to know our candidate early, and get them to understand the policy landscape,” she said. “They’re with us, but that takes a lot of repetition. That means it takes a lot more time, more than ever before, more than it did even two years ago, to break through to voters.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, like many Republican candidates in Nevada, struggled with the issue of abortion rights while on the campaign trail in 2022, giving conflicting messages and defaulting to a position of sidestepping the issue by calling abortion rights “settled” in the state.
It’s an argument Timmaraju thinks voters should reject next year when he is up for reelection.
“I don’t know Joe Lombardo well enough to understand what the hell he’s thinking,” she said. “You could think he’s moderate. It does not matter anymore. Anyone who is a Republican right now is complicit and cannot be trusted on fundamental freedoms like reproductive freedom.”
The GOP is in a “continual downward slide” into extremism, she added.

 


				Candidate filing doesn’t begin until March but Democrats Aaron Ford and Nicole Cannizzaro are among the candidates who have already publicly declared their intent to run for an office. Ford, currently attorney general, is running for governor. Cannizzaro, currently senate majority leader, is running for attorney general.
Both are currently expected to have Democratic primaries to contend with. Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill has announced her intent to run for governor, and Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine is actively campaigning for attorney general.
Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has said he will run for re-election. Douglas County Commissioner Danny Tarkanian, a Republican, has announced he will run for attorney general.			




Reproductive Freedom for All on Friday announced candidate endorsements for Democrats Nicole Cannizzaro, who is running for attorney general, and Aaron Ford, who is running for governor.
It’s the first of a string of endorsements the organization plans to make in battleground states for the 2026 elections.
Cannizzaro, who the Current interviewed alongside Timmaraju last week, said reproductive rights won’t be stripped away from people through “one sweeping piece of legislation that says, ‘here’s a bill to take away all of your rights.’”
“They happen with the incremental policy changes that do affect people,” she said. “There are many ways to attack access, and we are watching that happen right before our eyes.”
Added Timmaraju, “The Trump administration has shown absolutely no limits on how they will mess with states and their administration of federal programs.”
Telemedicine, which is filling voids where physical reproductive health clinics have been forced to close, is one target. The prescription drugs used in medical abortions have been another target.
“Abortion is legal in this state but if the Trump administration managed to circumvent access to medicinal abortion through a number of ways, there’s no protection for Nevadans, even if you codified it in your constitution. They are being nefarious,” said Timmaraju.
Attorney general races play a major role in combatting attempts to strip protections away, she added.
“Every state where we’ve passed a ballot measure but don’t have an AG on our side, we’ve had problems,” she said. “In the states where we’ve passed (ballot measures), and we have an AG who’s willing to enforce, is where we’ve actually seen the realization of the promise of the measure.”
The state of reproductive rights in Nevada
In 2024, Nevadans overwhelmingly supported Question 6, a proposal to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. The measure must pass again on the 2026 general election ballot to go into effect.
If passed, abortion rights would be further strengthened in the state. Abortion already has some strong protections, primarily through a law passed as a ballot measure in the 1990s. Changing that law requires a vote of the people.
In December, Nevada Medicaid expanded its coverage of abortion services, the result of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Nevada. That lawsuit argued that the existing policy violated the state’s Equal Rights Amendment, which voters passed in 2022.
But not everything has trended toward expanded access.
Earlier this year, Nevada’s 1985 parental notification law, which requires that minors notify their parents or guardian before having an abortion, went into effect for the first time. A decades-long injunction had kept the law from being enforced.
After that decision, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte announced it would fight the ruling in court but their efforts were thwarted in federal court. A separate state challenge is still pending.
Cannizzaro criticized the parental notification law, saying the years she spent as a Clark County prosecutor influenced her perspective.
“People do not like to think about the fact that there are children who are living in homes where they’re being sexually abused, and oftentimes their rapist is a family member, so it’s not safe for that child to ask for parental notification in order to not have to birth their rapist’s baby,” she said. “That is a very real thing that happens.”
The parental notification law now being enforced lacks protections for those children, she continued, and puts them at greater risk.
When asked if there had ever been conversations in the Legislature about addressing the 1985 law, Cannizzaro said there hadn’t been.
“Because there was an injunction in place for so long, there were other things that we were looking at,” she said. “The statutes that were actually on the books and in effect and not affected by any sort of injunction.”
Among those priorities was 2019’s Trust Nevada Women Act, which decriminalized medicated abortion and removed antiquated informed consent laws, such as a mandate that physicians tell patients about the emotional impact of an abortion.
Cannizzaro recalls the criticism at the time: “Why do you have to take outdated penalties out of state law? This is not an issue. This hasn’t been an issue. It’s not an issue.”
But attempts by the Trump administration to use century-old laws to restrict the prescription drugs used in medicinal abortion shows that antiquated laws can be a source of ammo for legislators or administrations looking to restrict access.
A focus on IVF
In the 2025 Legislative Session, Cannizzaro sponsored a “right to assisted reproduction treatment” bill, which would have required many private and public insurance companies to cover procedures like in-vitro fertilization. Lombardo vetoed it.
Cannizzaro said the governor’s office gave her no indication that he was considering vetoing the IVF bill, which received some bipartisan support, or any of the 87 bills he vetoed. This despite her office asking for feedback on the IVF bill and dozens of others prior to their final passage by the Legislature.
“We brought this to the governor’s office many times. ‘Hey, can you take a look at these bills? Hey, can you let us know where you’re at? Hey, can you let us know?’”
The IVF bill concerns raised in Lombardo’s veto letter could have been answered by watching the bill hearing, said Cannizzaro, or by having a conversation with her.
The veto letter cited, among other things, the potential cost to Nevada Medicaid. That provision, Cannizzaro said, was scheduled to go into effect in a future biennium, and Medicaid staff had indicated they would apply for an available waiver allowing the federal government to cover some of the cost.
Cannizzaro said she is committed, whether still in the Nevada State Senate or as attorney general, to making sure IVF returns “front and center” in the next regular legislative session.
Members of the caucus are “ready to take up that mantle,” she said, “because there’s no way that bill should have been vetoed.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/P1000776-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and dozens of his colleagues across the country are calling on tech companies and payment platforms to take action to block computer-generated pornography. 
Two letters the bipartisan group of attorneys general sent last month note 98% of fake videos posted online specifically feature so-called deepfake pornography. Almost all target women and girls. Altogether, these videos have received hundreds of millions of views.
This year, the Washington Legislature overwhelmingly approved making the willful distribution of a forged digital likeness, or deepfake, a gross misdemeanor crime. Experts say the law is the first in the nation to impose criminal liability for any malicious deepfake, not just those that are sexual or political. It went into effect late last month.
In recent years, lawmakers have also created a civil cause of action for political candidates depicted in manipulated content that isn’t disclosed as fabricated, and prohibited digitally-altered sexual photographs or videos of children and sharing any fake intimate images.
State AI regulations were at risk earlier this summer when Congress considered banning the rules in its massive tax cut and spending bill. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, led the push to remove that provision from the sprawling legislation.
At the federal level, President Donald Trump in May signed a new law criminalizing the distribution of revenge pornography, including artificial intelligence-generated deepfakes. The bipartisan law, called the Take It Down Act, requires platforms to allow victims of this type of sexual abuse to request their picture or video be taken down within 48 hours.
One of the letters penned last month asks Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, Google Pay and Apple Pay to enforce policies prohibiting their services from being used to profit from the disturbing content. In 2020, for example, Visa and Mastercard announced they’d stop processing payments on Pornhub due to videos depicting sexual assault.
Brown and the other attorneys general want similar action on deepfake pornography, arguing that sellers of tools used to make these videos accept money from these credit card companies and payment processors.
“Payment platforms should not only deny sellers the ability to use their services when they are on notice of these connections but should be actively working to identify and remove any such sellers from their network,” the letter reads.

One generative AI company, Civitai, has had to turn to cryptocurrency this year after its payment processor pulled out over concerns about nonconsensual computer-generated content.
A second letter, to the search engine arms of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, lists two requests.
First, the attorneys general ask the companies to describe how they’re already working to restrict access to deepfake pornography. And second, they ask for a commitment to further action “to avoid being complicit” in the proliferation of such content.
They liken this issue to how search engines respond when users look up how to build a bomb. Instead of a guide, the users get government resources and scientific articles. When someone searches for how to die by suicide, they get prevention options.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation)A bill to fund road maintenance and stave off hundreds of layoffs at the Oregon Department of Transportation narrowly cleared the Oregon House on Monday, more than two months after a prior attempt fizzled on the final night of the regular legislative session.
A 36-12 Labor Day vote on mostly party lines, reached after Democrats who control all branches of government agreed to make temporary a payroll tax increase to fund public transit, is the first major step to passing a 10-year, $4.3 billion package of tax and fee increases. The proposal still needs a vote from the Oregon Senate, anticipated on Wednesday.
It’s less than one-third the size of an ambitious earlier proposal, and even supporters characterized it as only a temporary fix meant to keep roads plowed, potholes filled and buses running.
“This bill keeps the lights on, but it doesn’t light the path forward,” said Rep. Mark Gamba, D-Milwaukie.



What fees and taxes would change under the proposed transportation package?
A gas tax increase from $0.40 to $0.46, effective Jan. 1, 2026, is expected to raise $90 million a year. The gas tax is split among the state and local governments, with half of the tax for the state, 30% for counties and 20% for cities.
An increase in annual registration fees from $43 to $85 for passenger vehicles; $63 to $105 for utility vehicles, light trailers, low-speed vehicles and medium-speed electric vehicles; and $44 to $86 for mopeds and motorcycles.
Increasing title fees for passenger vehicles from $77 to $216.
Temporarily doubling the payroll tax used to support public transit from 0.1% to 0.2% from Jan 1., 2026 to Jan. 1, 2028.
An increase to registration surcharges for electric and highly fuel-efficient vehicles, from $35 to $65 annually for cars with a 40+ miles-per-gallon rating, and from $115 to $145 annually for electric vehicles.



Phasing in a mandatory road usage charge program for electric vehicles by 2031. Electric vehicle drivers have been able to opt into the OReGO program and pay 2 cents per mile in exchange for lower registration fees, and the proposed change would mandate electric vehicle drivers participate in that program or pay a flat $340 annual fee.
Rep. Susan McLain, D-Forest Grove, and the House’s main architect of the earlier failed transportation package, said the latest proposal is a “pragmatic budget” that will help preserve roads and bridges that every Oregonian needs.
“We have heard from city councils and county commissions from every corner of Oregon, urban and liberal, north and south, east and west, red and blue, that this additional funding is absolutely a lifeline for their communities and their citizens,” McLain said.
Any tax increases require 36 votes to pass in the House, and the vote went on mostly party lines. But Rep. Cyrus Javadi, R-Tillamook, joined Democrats voting for the measure, while Rep. Annessa Hartman, D-Gladstone, joined Republicans in opposing it.
Javadi said he understood why Oregonians — including some “energetic” social media commenters whose sentiments he couldn’t repeat without violating House decorum rules — don’t want to raise the gas tax, or any tax.
“I received a lot of phone calls, sometimes at 10 o’clock at night, from people I have never met in my life, asking me to vote ‘no’ and threatening me I will lose my job if I dare vote ‘yes,’” Javadi said. “And to them, I might say, I think my job is worth it if compared to the hundreds more it will save across the state.”
Javadi, who represents a coastal district where landslides too often close stretches of Highway 101, or drivers crash on narrow, curving roads, said Oregonians need safe, open roads. Without passing the bill, he said, his constituents could be stranded by highway closures or unplowed snow or lose their lives because of stalled response from emergency services.
“The cost of doing nothing is far greater than the cost of doing something,” Javadi said. “We can pay a little more now at the pump, or we can pay a lot later in lost wages and lost opportunities.”
Hartman, meanwhile, said she still clearly remembers the days when she would choose to risk not renewing her vehicle registration to have the money to pay for groceries, and many of the working families in her district face similar choices.
“Those families in my district deserve my voice in this moment,” Hartman said.
House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, sat behind two piles of paper. Republicans described one, nearly 2 feet tall, as consisting of printed copies of more than 4,300 pieces of written testimony from Oregonians who opposed the bill. The other, much shorter, pile had copies of written comments from supporters.
In all, 94% of commenters opposed the transportation proposal, Drazan said. She read several of the comments, saying voices of those Oregonians should be heard.
“I could go on and on and on with the voices of Oregonians who are asking for this body to hear them,” Drazan said.
Rep. E. Werner Reschke, R-Malin, said it wasn’t the right time to raise taxes, especially given a recent revenue forecast that shows the state’s surplus turning into a deficit.
“We’re going to attempt to solve one problem but then create one that is far, far worse.”
But Rep. Paul Evans, D-Monmouth, said there was no time to wait.
“Right now, ODOT has a sucking chest wound,” Evans said. “We can all sit around and watch the patient die; we can debate life choices and whether or not they should have done this or that. But the fact of the matter is, weather is coming, and our families and our cities and our state need folks out there.”

(Provided/Savannah Smith and Garland Wilson)COLUMBIA — The night before South Carolina’s annual beekeeping conference and competition, high school students Savannah Smith and Garland Wilson sat in a hotel bathroom, picking bubbles out of jars of honey.
Smith, a senior, and Wilson, a junior, harvested the honey as part of the Governor’s School for Agriculture’s beekeeping club, using equipment donated to bolster the fledgling program. The two needed their jars to be perfectly pristine for the next day’s competition, where they would be two of the youngest people competing.
Panic set in when condensation from a shower caused the jars to fog up, and again when bubbles reappeared. The students rushed to wipe off all the watermarks and put the jars in a car overnight, hoping the bubbles would disappear.
“We went out the next day, and they were beautiful,” Smith said. “And then we got first (place).”
5 years after reopening with a new mission, SC agriculture school is beyond capacity

The students’ success at the July competition in Columbia, where they won half a dozen awards, shows the success of the year-old program, said instructor Susan Jones, an apiculture specialist who competed alongside her students.
“Getting these girls to the state conference was kind of a test case,” Jones said. “I really did not expect them to win. We were going as a learning experience. And the fact that they did so well is just very satisfying.”
In its second year, the program is set to expand.
Duke Energy donated $25,000 for state-of-the-art honey harvesting equipment and a honey house, which gives students a dedicated space to filter and jar their honey.
With 19 hives of honeybees, students will start making and selling their own beeswax products while continuing to make award-winning honey, Jones said.
Like with all courses at the agricultural school, known for centuries as John de la Howe, the goal is for students to recognize beekeeping as a viable career path, Jones said.
Smith and Wilson are already on their way to achieving intermediate certification, one step down from the master certification that separates hobby and commercial beekeepers, they said.
Beekeeping is an essential career not just to produce honey but to help farmers’ crops grow, Duke Energy spokesman Ryan Mosier said in an email. The donation came from the utility’s foundation, which focuses in part on climate resiliency, he said.
“Agribusiness is a top industry in South Carolina going back to the state’s beginnings, and this school is educating the next generation of those business leaders,” Mosier said.
Getting started
Neither Smith nor Wilson had any particular affinity for bees when they elected to start their own hives.
“I just heard it, and I was like, ‘I like outside. Bees are outside. Bees are good, apparently.’ So, I signed up,” Wilson said.
After a year of helping tend six hives, both earned their beginners’ certifications. At least once a week, they go out to their hives to check on the bees, making sure they show no signs of pests or diseases, Jones said.

The program got off to a rough start. Jones tried to start the program in 2021, after giving several guest lectures on beekeeping.
The school’s teachers had too much on their plates to properly instruct the students on how to care for the hives, and the school couldn’t find any volunteers in rural McCormick, so none of the bees survived over the winter.
Jones, a former president of the South Carolina Beekeepers Association, tried again in 2024, after coming onto the staff as an instructor. After a successful first year, the school’s aviary expanded to 19 hives this school year.
Each hive can produce between four and nine gallons of honey, Jones said.
“When you start doing that math, that’s going to be a lot of honey for this next year,” she said.
The program isn’t all about honey, though. Honey is a great byproduct, but the real value comes from teaching students about pollination. The students also look after bumblebees, which don’t produce honey, at the campus’ greenhouse.
“If you want something from the bees, it’s one thing,” Smith said. Non-native honey bees are the best at making honey and other byproducts, “but if you’re talking about, ‘Save the bees,’ let’s talk native bees.”
After normal classes finished every day, Smith and Wilson joined several classmates in walking out to a classroom in the woods with their notebooks and pencils. There, Jones lectured for about two hours at a time.
The knowledge shows. Smith and Wilson know about the origins of different bees, how they pollinate and how that affects the environment.
Both are certified beekeeping apprentices, and both are on their way to moving up to the intermediary level, which is a rare feat for teenagers, Jones said.
Award-winning honey
Already, the students have a strong foundation, Jones said. That much was clear when Smith and Wilson took home first-place prizes at the South Carolina Beekeepers Association conference in July.

Wilson walked away with first-place ribbons in novice honey and dark honey, as well as a third-place accolade for photography. Smith scored runner-up in novice honey, first place in amber honey and fifth place in black jar, which judges decide based on taste alone.
The awards are based not on a ranking system but on whether the honey meets a certain standard, Jones said.
A category could have multiple first-place winners or none at all. In this case, scoring first place meant the students made the honey as good as it could be, she said.
At nearly every turn, Smith and Wilson were the youngest people in the room.
“Everyone was like, ‘Oh my goodness,’ and they’d never seen us before, so they were like, ‘Where did they come from?’” Smith said.
This year, the students feel good about their odds.
Different parts of campus produce different tastes and colors of honey, since the bees pollinate different flowers and trees. Smith, in particular, plans to graduate with a big win. She has a hive in the woods that she thinks is making “the most natural honey under the sun,” she said.
With the donated equipment, the students can collect beeswax as well, which they can turn into any number of items, which Jones calls “lotions and potions.” Students will be able to submit candles, soap or lip balm for consideration at next year’s conference.
Next up is the South Carolina State Fair in October. The students plan to clean up any problems they had at the conference over the summer to perfect their jars of honey.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)The divide among Democrats this year is as much attitudinal as it is ideological. 
Rank-and-file Democrats are thirsting for leaders who will fight rather than fold in the face of the Trump administration’s unprecedented power grabs. 
Annie Wells, whose crop art recreation of Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan’s Senate campaign poster hung in the State Fair Agriculture Horticulture building, doesn’t want a candidate who tries to meet Republicans in the middle.
“She’s one of the Democrats that’s actually trying to stand up and do things,” Wells said. “I’m frustrated with a lot of the Democrats that are not being bold enough in response to what’s happening at the federal level.”
If there’s one thing Flanagan’s campaign wants Democratic voters to know, it’s which side of the fight/fold divide she’s on. 
“Peggy is the most dedicated fighter for kids in America, y’all,” Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a packed rally in Minneapolis Friday night. 
“I’m here to fight for a woman who has the courage to fight for all of us,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Democrats across the country continue to grapple with what went wrong in 2024 — when Flanagan’s governing partner, Gov. Tim Walz, was on the national ticket — and how to win voters back in 2026.

For Flanagan, it starts with a fighting stance. 
“I know resiliency, and survival, and fight, and overcoming challenges and any obstacle that people put in our way,” she said.
Flanagan’s opponent in the Democratic primary is U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, a moderate who has represented the south metro in Congress since 2019. As Flanagan courts the party’s progressive grassroots, Craig has long appealed to centrist suburban and rural voters, emphasizing her record supporting law enforcement, border security, agriculture and collaboration across the aisle.
After years spent cultivating that political persona, Craig has pumped up her anti-Trump rhetoric since launching her first statewide campaign. In an April video announcing her Senate run, Craig called out Trump for the “chaos and corruption coming out of Washington, crashing down on all of us, every day,” and “a president trampling our rights and freedoms, as he profits for personal gain.”
Still, listen to how Flanagan recently framed her campaign against Craig — in classic Midwestern style, without naming or directly attacking Craig — in front of more than 1,000 supporters at at a brewery in northeast Minneapolis: “Will we send Washington the same old people and the same old solutions — or will we be bolder and fight harder and get more done for people?” 
A ‘lived experience’ candidate
Flanagan is an enrolled member of the White Earth Nation and the daughter of Anishinaabe activist Marvin Manypenny, a fierce advocate for tribal sovereignty. If elected, she will be the first Native woman elected to the U.S. Senate.
She was raised by her mother in St. Louis Park, where they relied on public assistance to survive. In speeches, Flanagan tells stories of walking home from the food shelf, cradling government surplus cheese under her arm like a football; holding a different-colored lunch ticket to indicate that she qualified for free or reduced-cost lunch; relying on Medicaid for health care and Section 8 vouchers for housing.
“If we had more people serving in the U.S. Senate who relied on SNAP for nutrition and who relied on Medicaid for their health care, we probably wouldn’t have passed this big, ugly bill,” Flanagan said, referring to the GOP mega-law Trump signed on July 4.

After working on the late Sen. Paul Wellstone’s campaign in 2002, Flanagan won her first election in 2004, when she became the Minneapolis School Board’s youngest member at age 25. 
She became the director of the Native American Leadership Program at Wellstone Action, an academy started by the Wellstone family after the senator’s death. The organization trained influential Minnesota Democrats including Walz and Ellison. 
Flanagan met Walz at a three-day “Camp Wellstone” and knocked doors for his first campaign in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. (Walz won that race and the following five.)
As executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund of Minnesota, she co-chaired a coalition pushing to raise Minnesota’s minimum wage. The coalition scored a major win in 2014 when the DFL-controlled Legislature raised the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2016, and adjusted for inflation after.
Flanagan won a seat in the state House in 2015, representing the west metro district that includes her hometown of St. Louis Park. 
Walz selected Flanagan as his running mate in 2017. She was an olive branch to the left wing of the DFL and a counterweight to Walz’s perceived centrist leanings — he’d represented a purple (now red) district in Congress for more than a decade and had an A rating from the NRA.
Walz and Flanagan both claim credit to the slate of DFL priorities passed in the 2023 legislative session: paid family and medical leave, free school meals, and universal background checks for gun purchases, among others. 
The almost-governor
The day Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket for the highest executive offices in the nation, Flanagan’s life changed, too.
This time last year, Flanagan was sampling the new State Fair foods with chef Andrew Zimmern and serving all-you-can-drink milk.
Behind the scenes, she was preparing to ascend to the governor’s office, meeting with donors and prospective staffers. In public, she campaigned for Walz and Harris at 77 stops in 90 days. She stepped into the national spotlight as the successor to Walz, pending his and Harris’ victory; Politico profiled her, and top party leaders asked her to speak on day one of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.
But when Harris and Walz lost, Flanagan’s shortcut to the governor’s office abruptly closed.

Walz returned to Minnesota and stepped back from public life for a couple of months. Flanagan, for her part, returned to the stream of appearances that define the public role of lieutenant governor: packing meals at food shelves; gaveling in the state Senate; meeting with the Future Farmers of America and small business owners and social workers and labor unions and community college students.
After nearly a decade joined at the hip, Walz and Flanagan stopped appearing together in public. Flanagan wasn’t in attendance at Walz’s homecoming speech or routine events she had attended in the past. 
Walz administration officials, granted anonymity by the Star Tribune, said in December that Walz wasn’t happy with the steps Flanagan took to prepare for governorship, including planning for a potential run in 2026 and tapping into Walz’s campaign funds without authorization for some campaign work. (Walz publicly downplayed the division and praised Flanagan; Flanagan never commented publicly on the rift, and says she’ll support Walz with his next steps.)
And then, in February, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith announced she won’t seek re-election in 2026, creating an opportunity for Flanagan to set out on her own.
Flanagan’s role in the frenzied 2024 campaign was to support Walz and Harris; but it also formed the foundation for a future statewide run.
“I do think it was an opportunity for me to get to know more Minnesotans to get to know folks nationwide,” Flanagan told the Reformer. 
Walz has not yet announced whether he will run for a third term. Flanagan’s Senate bid means he would have to find a new running mate.

Despite the political separation from Walz, Flanagan will be forced to defend their shared record and — not unlike Harris with Joe Biden — decide when to publicly break from the administration she has served. From flagging school test scores to a looming budget deficit, fraud in public programs to population stagnation, Republicans — and Craig, depending on how she wants to run her campaign — will have fodder.  
Eschewing corporate money
Standing in the way of Flanagan’s aspirations are a primary election, a general election and a president with a firm grasp on Congress and the courts.
Trump and Republicans have “ransacked our government” and are “spitting in the faces of millions of people” who stand to lose health care or food assistance, Flanagan said at the recent rally with Warren.
Flanagan also lobbed attacks at corporations and big-money politics. 
Voters need to elect people who “have the guts to fight against these powerful corporate interests who are pulling the strings these days,” Flanagan said. 
Flanagan has promised not to accept donations from corporate political action committees. 
By the end of June, she had raised nearly $1.4 million, with most of the money coming from individual donations of $200 or less.
Many of the largest donations — most in the amount of $3,500 — were from tribal nations from around the country. 
Standing on a platform surrounded by Democratic-Farmer-Labor voters at the party’s state fair tent, Flanagan introduced herself in Ojibwe, as she does in most public appearances. Then she switched to English:

DemasAs Michigan Lawmakers work to court data centers through tax incentives, Consumers Energy, one of the state’s largest energy providers, is seeking to tweak its rate requirements for businesses using large amounts of energy over time, citing increasing requests for service from these types of facilities. 
Earlier this year, Consumers sent an application to the Michigan Public Service Commission proposing several provisions to protect ratepayers from facing increased costs as a result of the heavy energy demand brought by data centers. 
Among those proposals are a 15-year minimum contract term, minimum billing and an exit fee requirement. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Without the Company’s proposed protections, other customers would pay for the incremental costs to serve a data center or other large load customer if that customer exits service before sufficient revenue is generated to offset costs,” Consumers wrote in its brief to the Public Service Commission.
While the company has modified its proposal to consider feedback from several stakeholders, members of the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Law and Policy Center and Vote Solar argue Consumers could go further. 
In addition to focusing on financial and contract terms, the three groups said Consumers’ plan should further consider the increased demand for energy these data centers will bring, and how clean energy resources factor into its plan to bring on new energy generation to meet that need. 
“Consumers Energy’s proposal fails to fully recognize the paradigm shift that new data center loads represent, and their initial brief only engages a narrow subset of the concerns raised. A clear directive from the Commission is critical to ensure a proactive approach to new data centers that supports an affordable, clean energy future for Michigan,” Lee Shaver, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement.

In a brief of their own, the groups offered several recommendations they say would better protect ratepayers and support Michigan’s transition to clean energy. 
Those recommendations include requiring large load customers to provide a clean energy sourcing plan as part of the process of connecting to the grid alongside regular reporting on clean energy and usage; ensuring these customers have access to voluntary green pricing, which allows customers to specify that a specific amount of their power comes from renewable energy sources; and establishing a data center specific rate to keep costs from shifting to other customers. 
“Many tech companies building data centers in Consumers Energy’s territory have ambitious clean energy goals. With the right incentives and guardrails, they could help advance the region’s clean energy transition. This case gives the MPSC its best chance to act now and avoid falling behind. If it waits, Consumers risks triggering rushed clean energy procurements, higher costs and greater risks for customers,” Saad Siddique, an economist and analyst with the Environmental Law and Policy Center said in a statement. 
Members of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan also asked the Public Service Commission to ensure Consumer’s modified rate structure complies with Michigan’s requirement that energy companies provide electricity from 100% clean energy sources by 2040.

They also argued that service agreements between Consumers Energy and data center customers should include a plan for meeting the benchmarks building up to the 100% clean energy standard, through a combination of resources supplied by the data center, long-term contracts for renewable resources and/or participation in voluntary green pricing.
In an email, Consumers Energy Media Relations Specialist Brian Wheeler said the proposed changes for large load customers does not address or change its future electric supply plans. 
“Consumers Energy continues to follow our long-term energy supply plan to both serve new data centers and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

(Courtesy photo)Much of the discussion surrounding property tax reform has focused on schools, law enforcement and local government having to cut services due to reduced funding. But libraries are also in line to see impacts from Senate Enrolled Act 1 – legislation passed in April cutting property taxes.
Several Indiana librarians expressed uncertainty about the exact effects of SEA 1, a complicated law that impacts both property and income taxes. 
“I wish I knew exactly what all this was going to mean,” said Kim Porter, director of the Batesville Memorial Public Library. “I don’t understand it.”
Two major concerns raised by SEA 1, according to Indiana Library Federation President Julie Wendorf are property tax revenue and the local income tax (LIT) distribution formula. Hoosier homeowners are expected to save an average of $300 in property taxes – the primary funding source for most libraries, according to Wendorf. Paired with changes to LIT formulas, many library’s budgets will feel the strain. 
“Library funding across Indiana is not standardized,” Wendorf explained, “each public library receives tax support in a unique manner, influenced by its local property tax rate and access to local income tax revenue.”  
The full effects of SEA 1 likely won’t be seen until 2028, by which point many will face “significant reductions to their overall funding,” said Wendorf, “due to both diminished property tax growth and decreased LIT allocations.”
Libraries can’t raise local income taxes on their own and instead will have to petition counties to approve a LIT dollars for their use. 










Sure, the library is an old-fashioned concept. So is democracy, so is equal opportunity, so is knowledge.


– Carri Randall, Johnson County library patron


Beyond her role with the library federation, Wendorf serves as the director of Crown Point Community Library. 
“As local governments prepare their 2026 budgets, we’re trying to account for the impact of SEA 1 without having much concrete data,” she shared. Crown Point’s library has implemented a hiring freeze for new positions and is reviewing staff vacancies individually. When a department head recently announced their retirement, Wendorf said, “I merged two departments to achieve significant savings.” 
While working on next year’s budget, Wendorf explained that she’s reviewing contracts and expenses, cutting costs where possible to “help offset the first year’s impact.”  Offsetting that impact, however, is challenging “because SEA 1 limits revenue growth,” meaning “the gap between funding and rising expenses will only widen over time.”
Coupled with what Wendorf describes as “cascading funding pressures,” Indiana’s local, state and even federal libraries will see their ability to provide services hindered. One notable example — following the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services in March, the Indiana State Library lost $3 million in federal funding. That $3 million directly supported Indiana’s public libraries. 
The state library’s budget was also further cut by state lawmakers, which impacts what it can provide local libraries. Areas affected by these cuts and SEA 1 include public internet access — many libraries rely on the state library’s Internet Connectivity Grant, which partially reimburses local libraries for service costs to provide public internet access — and the INSPIRE database, an education and research tool used by public, academic and school libraries. Funding cuts may force public libraries to secure their own database subscriptions at a high cost to maintain the same level of access.
“Smaller or rural libraries with limited reserves could be forced into structural deficits, staff cuts or service closures,” Wendorf said, “as a result, public access to literacy and lifelong learning resources, digital equity and community program could be curtailed at a time when Hoosiers continue to rely heavily on libraries for these services.”
Vanessa Martin, director of the Greensburg Decatur County Public Library, elaborated on where rural libraries, especially, may need to make cuts. 
“I think a lot of libraries are looking at their electronic offerings,” Martin said, “So, Overdrive, Libby, Hoopla,” she named three widely used ebook and streaming services libraries use, “any databases that aren’t getting used as much. Those aren’t things that we necessarily want to completely cut out,” she emphasized, noting use of many databases has increased, “but we might have to limit more.” 
She added that regarding programming, libraries “might have to do more with less” and potentially explore staffing cuts. The key, she said, is to find “a good balance of where the money goes to fund all the different things that we do.”
“People are still using the library,” Martin said, “we have people in here every day – for things that go beyond the books.” 
Martin noted that Greensburg’s library has people visiting daily for internet access, meeting spaces, tutoring and more, “we’re still needed,” she said, “our digital offerings numbers continue to go up.”

Porter, with the Batesville library, is in a particularly unique position as the city sits on the Ripley-Franklin County line. Both counties have additional library systems that will also need to be funded via LIT and property tax money.
“It could be interesting,” Porter observed, “I could get funds from one county and not from the other.” 
One-third of Batesville’s operating budget currently comes from local income tax dollars — “it’s just going to be really interesting, because I know it’s not going to cover everything that we do.”
Some library directors are already working to educate their communities on the potential impact of SEA 1.
Johnson County Public Library Director Lisa Lintner hosted two public meetings covering ‘Funding and the Future of JCPL’ — walking citizens through how the library is funded and how SEA 1 might affect the library’s future.
 “I am asking residents to volunteer to be advocates on our behalf,” Lintner said, “to support fully funding our library in the future, when we’ll need to begin petitioning the county in 2027 for continued funding of our local income taxes in 2028.” 
About 45 people attended the program, according to Lintner, who added that she plans to repeat the program every few months. “Attendees were grateful to understand more clearly how the library is funded,” she said, “many expressed concern for our future funding and wanted to learn how they could support us.”
The Johnson County library gets 40% of its operating budget from LIT money. 
With the passage of SEA 1, Lintner said, “we will have to begin petitioning our county council” for LIT funds in 2027. By 2028, “many library districts could see devastating outcomes if LIT funding is not approved,” she observed. 
The less-heralded provisions of property tax reform

More than 200 library districts across Indiana rely on LIT money, according to Lintner.
Kerri Gipson, a long-time Johnson County public library user, said “it breaks my heart to think of JCPL not getting necessary funding to continue providing the valuable resources and services that they currently provide. Libraries are such an asset to community.” 
The library became a big part of Gipson and her family’s lives in 2014, when Gipson started homeschooling her son following a move to Johnson County. Gipson and her son have both bonded with library staff over the past decade and they’ve both gotten involved in volunteer work — her son runs three weekly Dungeons and Dragons programs at JCPL and its branches and was named volunteer of the year in 2024. Gipson herself has done ESL tutoring and assists in her son’s programs.
“It means so much that JCPL creates safe, inclusive environments where everyone feels welcome and values,” she said.
Carri Randall has been a lifelong library user, dating back to her childhood in Los Angeles and volunteers at JCPL when possible. Randall, a teacher, shared that she and her colleagues “rely on libraries,” noting they make resources accessible to all that might not be otherwise.
“When I work with students on gathering information – there is no way it can be done solely within the confines of the school day. The only places they are going to be able to access any needed information for free is the public library,” especially kids from lower-income homes — three of Johnson County’s schools have free or reduced lunch rates of over 40%, according to Randall.Libraries are no longer just information vaults or the keepers of information, she said. As examples, Randall cited database access, ebooks, wifi hotspot access, programs for the public, interlibrary loans, access to out-of-print sources, story hour and many other valuable educational services.
She believes libraries provide all residents with access to resources “that will mean the difference between success and failure for residents as individuals, Johnson County as a community and the United States as a nation. Sure, the library is an old-fashioned concept. So is democracy, so is equal opportunity, so is knowledge.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Summer-Reading-kickoff-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

Artificial intelligence systems are thirsty, consuming as much as 500 milliliters of water – a single-serving water bottle – for each short conversation a user has with the GPT-3 version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT system. They use roughly the same amount of water to draft a 100-word email message.
That figure includes the water used to cool the data center’s servers and the water consumed at the power plants generating the electricity to run them.
But the study that calculated those estimates also pointed out that AI systems’ water usage can vary widely, depending on where and when the computer answering the query is running.

To me, as an academic librarian and professor of education, understanding AI is not just about knowing how to write prompts. It also involves understanding the infrastructure, the trade-offs, and the civic choices that surround AI.
Many people assume AI is inherently harmful, especially given headlines calling out its vast energy and water footprint. Those effects are real, but they’re only part of the story.
When people move from seeing AI as simply a resource drain to understanding its actual footprint, where the effects come from, how they vary, and what can be done to reduce them, they are far better equipped to make choices that balance innovation with sustainability.
Two hidden streams
Behind every AI query are two streams of water use.
The first is on-site cooling of servers that generate enormous amounts of heat. This often uses evaporative cooling towers – giant misters that spray water over hot pipes or open basins. The evaporation carries away heat, but that water is removed from the local water supply, such as a river, a reservoir or an aquifer. Other cooling systems may use less water but more electricity.
The second stream is used by the power plants generating the electricity to power the data center. Coal, gas and nuclear plants use large volumes of water for steam cycles and cooling.
Hydropower also uses up significant amounts of water, which evaporates from reservoirs. Concentrated solar plants, which run more like traditional steam power stations, can be water-intensive if they rely on wet cooling.
By contrast, wind turbines and solar panels use almost no water once built, aside from occasional cleaning.
Climate and timing matter
Water use shifts dramatically with location. A data center in cool, humid Ireland can often rely on outside air or chillers and run for months with minimal water use. By contrast, a data center in Arizona in July may depend heavily on evaporative cooling. Hot, dry air makes that method highly effective, but it also consumes large volumes of water, since evaporation is the mechanism that removes heat.
Timing matters too. A University of Massachusetts Amherst study found that a data center might use only half as much water in winter as in summer. And at midday during a heat wave, cooling systems work overtime. At night, demand is lower.
Newer approaches offer promising alternatives. For instance, immersion cooling submerges servers in fluids that don’t conduct electricity, such as synthetic oils, reducing water evaporation almost entirely.
And a new design from Microsoft claims to use zero water for cooling, by circulating a special liquid through sealed pipes directly across computer chips. The liquid absorbs heat and then releases it through a closed-loop system without needing any evaporation. The data centers would still use some potable water for restrooms and other staff facilities, but cooling itself would no longer draw from local water supplies.
These solutions are not yet mainstream, however, mainly because of cost, maintenance complexity and the difficulty of converting existing data centers to new systems. Most operators rely on evaporative systems.
A simple skill you can use
The type of AI model being queried matters, too. That’s because of the different levels of complexity and the hardware and amount of processor power they require. Some models may use far more resources than others. For example, one study found that certain models can consume over 70 times more energy and water than ultra‑efficient ones.
You can estimate AI’s water footprint yourself in just three steps, with no advanced math required.
Step 1 – Look for credible research or official disclosures. Independent analyses estimate that a medium-length GPT-5 response, which is about 150 to 200 words of output, or roughly 200 to 300 tokens, uses about 19.3 watt-hours. A response of similar length from GPT-4o uses about 1.75 watt-hours.
Step 2 – Use a practical estimate for the amount of water per unit of electricity, combining the usage for cooling and for power.
Independent researchers and industry reports suggest that a reasonable range today is about 1.3 to 2.0 milliliters per watt-hour. The lower end reflects efficient facilities that use modern cooling and cleaner grids. The higher end represents more typical sites.
Step 3 – Now it’s time to put the pieces together. Take the energy number you found in Step 1 and multiply it by the water factor from Step 2. That gives you the water footprint of a single AI response.
Here’s the one-line formula you’ll need:
Energy per prompt (watt-hours) × Water factor (milliliters per watt-hour) = Water per prompt (in milliliters)
For a medium-length query to GPT-5, that calculation should use the figures of 19.3 watt-hours and 2 milliliters per watt-hour. 19.3 x 2 = 39 milliliters of water per response.
For a medium-length query to GPT-4o, the calculation is 1.75 watt-hours x 2 milliliters per watt-hour = 3.5 milliliters of water per response.
If you assume the data centers are more efficient, and use 1.3 milliliters per watt-hour, the numbers drop: about 25 milliliters for GPT-5 and 2.3 milliliters for GPT-4o.
A recent Google technical report said a median text prompt to its Gemini system uses just 0.24 watt-hours of electricity and about 0.26 milliliters of water – roughly the volume of five drops. However, the report does not say how long that prompt is, so it can’t be compared directly with GPT water usage.
Those different estimates – ranging from 0.26 milliliters to 39 milliliters – demonstrate how much the effects of efficiency, AI model and power-generation infrastructure all matter.
Comparisons and context
To truly understand how much water these queries use, it can be helpful to compare them to other familiar water uses.
When multiplied by millions, AI queries’ water use adds up. OpenAI reports about 2.5 billion prompts per day. That figure includes queries to its GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 and GPT-5 systems, with no public breakdown of how many queries are issued to each particular model.
Using independent estimates and Google’s official reporting gives a sense of the possible range:

All Google Gemini median prompts: about 650,000 liters per day.
All GPT 4o medium prompts: about 8.8 million liters per day.
All GPT 5 medium prompts: about 97.5 million liters per day.

For comparison, Americans use about 34 billion liters per day watering residential lawns and gardens. One liter is about one-quarter of a gallon.
Generative AI does use water, but – at least for now – its daily totals are small compared with other common uses such as lawns, showers and laundry.
But its water demand is not fixed. Google’s disclosure shows what is possible when systems are optimized, with specialized chips, efficient cooling and smart workload management. Recycling water and locating data centers in cooler, wetter regions can help, too.
Transparency matters, as well: When companies release their data, the public, policymakers and researchers can see what is achievable and compare providers fairly.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/waterpfascancer-2048x1492-1-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

‘Hold people accountable’ 
Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.



I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat



During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
‘What is your why?’
Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

Should you be worried about climate change? The answer used to be debatable — literally.
Way back in 2007, NPR aired a debate over the proposition that “Global Warming Is Not a Crisis.” The panel had six commentators, divided equally into two sides. Those on the “not a crisis” side (which included Jurassic Park author and nonscientist Michael Crichton) argued that much of the current alarm was based on “ignorance.” Sure, the climate was changing, but that wasn’t anything new, they said. They weren’t convinced carbon dioxide was driving it this time around, either.
Those stuck arguing that global warming was not not a crisis — an awkward double negative — countered that the scientific community was in near-universal agreement that CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions were at fault. They laid out the dire consequences (rising seas, shrinking ice caps, warming oceans) and called on the audience to think of the planet their children and grandchildren would inherit.
Afterward, the conservative think tank The Heartland Institute declared that the climate “realists” had beaten the “alarmists.” Polling the audience, NPR found that 57 percent thought that global warming was a crisis before the debate, but only 42 percent did afterward. The results seemed to confirm the fears that participant Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist, had outlined on his blog ahead of the event. “Is this kind of rhetorical jousting useful for clarifying issues of science … ? Or does it just validate the least serious opposition?” he wrote.
In 2010, around the time when these kinds of debates were popular, almost half of Americans falsely believed there was a lot of disagreement among scientists that climate change was happening. Fast-forward to today, and the public’s understanding has evolved. More Americans acknowledge that scientists agree on climate change. People are also increasingly worried about the consequences: The intense floods, wildfires, and heat waves battering the country have sparked concern not only for the future, but for the present.
And yet the old way of discussing climate change — framing it as a debate — appears to be coming back into fashion, this time spurred by the federal government.
A new report from the Department of Energy, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,” arrived in late July. “Climate change is a challenge — not a catastrophe,” Chris Wright, the Trump-appointed energy secretary, declared in the foreword. He wrote that the public conversation on climate change had “drifted from the science” because of exaggerated media coverage, potentially leading to “misguided policies based on fear.”
While the report acknowledged that yes, the planet is getting warmer, and yes, it’s caused by humans, it argued that these changes aren’t as bad as you think. It contended that carbon dioxide is good for plant growth, that computer models are overstating predictions of future warming, and that sea level rise isn’t accelerating. These conclusions were no surprise considering that the report’s five authors — John Christy, Judith Curry, Steve Koonin, Ross McKitrick, and Roy Spencer — have a long track record of pushing back against mainstream narratives about climate change.
Among those who care deeply about climate change, the report sounded alarm bells. Critics pointed to its use of selectively chosen data. A fact-check from the data journalism nonprofit Carbon Brief identified more than 100 cases of false or misleading claims in the 140-page document, with some researchers saying their cited work had been mischaracterized. Some scientists, led by Andrew Dessler at Texas A&M University, have begun organizing an academic response to the report.
“It is a shock to see the U.S. government, in an official document, deny scientific realities and spew so much disinformation,” said Rachel Cleetus, a senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
But getting scientists riled up might have been intentional. One of the report’s authors, Koonin, recently told E&E News that the expected pushback to the DOE report is part of a long-standing effort to create a “red team, blue team” exercise that could revive the “debate” over climate change.
“Red team, blue team” is a reference to an adversarial military exercise used to expose weaknesses. The idea, with roots in 19th-century Prussian war games, took off in the U.S. during the Cold War in the 1960s and has since become popular in cybersecurity. Companies will hire a “red” team to try to poke holes in their “blue” team’s digital defenses. These provocations help companies bolster their defenses against actual hackers.
The red team, blue team idea was floated by an EPA official during President Donald Trump’s first term as a way to challenge mainstream climate science. Before that, it had been raised by Spencer, another author on the 2025 report, as early as 2009. For a matter like climate change, however, a loud red-team attack has the effect of making the whole field look wobbly, split into two equally divided sides.
“It can really create perceptions of false equivalence in the public sphere,” said Max Boykoff, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.
Matt Burgess, an environmental economist at the University of Wyoming, said that the context of the DOE report — the Trump administration’s broader assault on climate information — makes it hard to take it seriously. While the DOE report was underway, officials removed congressionally mandated climate reports on how climate change affects life in the United States from the federal website they lived on. The administration has also cut billions in funding for climate programs and research, and has proposed halting projects that monitor climate change.
On the same day the DOE report was released in July, the Environmental Protection Agency fired another shot at climate science, saying it would roll back the Obama-era finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health — the scientific foundation that allows the agency to address climate change. In its proposal to repeal this so-called “endangerment” finding, the EPA cited the new DOE report, and many have interpreted it as a pretext for the EPA’s announcement.
So the “blue team” pushed back. Two environmental groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists, filed a lawsuit against both agencies earlier this month, arguing that Wright had secretly arranged for five “hand-picked skeptics” to write a report challenging the scientific consensus on climate change. The lawsuit alleges that involving a “secret, unaccountable” group in policymaking concerns violated federal law. (The DOE did not respond to a request for comment for this story.)
But scientists may want to be careful in how they push back at the report, since arguing over fringe viewpoints may have the effect of amplifying them, falling into the same trap created by the climate debates of 20 years ago. One study from 2023 found that disinformation about climate change was more emotionally compelling and persuasive to people than scientific facts. To Cleetus, the government’s revival of the climate “debate” is a distraction from the task at hand. “We’re losing precious, precious time to help stave off these terrible impacts of climate change,” Cleetus said. “And I don’t know what we will say to our children and grandchildren, that this is what we wasted our time on.”
Much of the polarization around climate change appears to stem from disagreements over what to do about it. In recent years, many advocates have justified faster action — more regulations, fewer fossil fuels, and more green technology — by appealing to “science.” The Biden administration even enshrined “listen to science” as its official policy. But while science can inform policy decisions, it doesn’t answer the question of how to navigate the complex moral and cultural issues that come with reimagining life after fossil fuels.
The political left has used the science-has-all-the-answers framing to shut down important conversations about real trade-offs, said Travis Fisher, who helped organize the DOE report. He is also the director of energy and environmental policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He says that by using “the science” as justification to push through controversial policies, it invites skepticism in science as an objective force.
“There’s only so many times you can get hit with that, like, trademark ‘science’ club before you start saying, ‘Hey, what’s actually in that club that you have?’” Fisher said. “‘Is it as solid as you say it is?’”
It bears repeating that upward of 97 percent of climate experts agree that human-caused climate change is happening, but there are many areas of climate science that merit further study. For example, the question of whether climate change affects tornadoes (not yet clear) or just how quickly and strongly CO2 emissions will drive global warming in the future. (The DOE report argues that the planet is less sensitive to CO2 than commonly believed, while scientist James Hansen argues that it’s actually more sensitive.) Science is always evolving as new evidence comes in, and it takes many studies to create a sufficient body of evidence before a causal argument can be accepted.
Take that famous 97 percent stat from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example. According to the organization, it came from “not just … a single study, but by a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys of scientists, content analyses of peer-reviewed studies, and public statements issued by virtually every membership organization of experts in this field.”
To Burgess, the environmental economist, the messy context around the DOE report represents a missed opportunity — particularly because he thinks the critics make some good points. There are certain narratives, especially around the severity of climate impacts, he said, “that are underappreciated in the mainstream discourse.”
But the solution, Burgess said, isn’t war-room style debates — it’s open, transparent collaboration between what might be described as the “blue team” and “red team.” As an example of a way to encourage thoughtful engagement, he pointed to the University of Pennsylvania’s Adversarial Collaboration Project, which encourages scholars who disagree to work together to resolve polarizing scientific disputes.
“We do ourselves and the community a favor when we dispassionately try to, through things like adversarial collaboration, get to the bottom of genuine scholarly debates about how to interpret facts,” Burgess said. “Even if we don’t like the people who interpret the facts differently than we do.”
Wright has hinted that the DOE’s report, which is open to the public to comment, may just be the start of the administration’s move to stir up debate over climate change. “We’ll probably have public events here in D.C. this fall,” he said in an interview with CNN earlier this month. “We want to have an honest dialogue with the American people about climate change.”
Burgess interprets the whole episode around report differently. “I think it’s just basically another opportunity for people to yell at each other online and go back to their silos,” he said.

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The panel established by Gov. Mike Kehoe to write rules for how long people who break the law must stay in prison may be violating the law itself by meeting in secret.
As one of his first acts as governor in January, Kehoe ordered the Department of Corrections and the Division of Probation and Parole set up a working group for a comprehensive study of parole rules. The group is to work toward “the goal of providing clarity, transparency, and accountability for the parole process.”
The only time the 15-member panel has met in public was June 13, when it held a 25-minute public hearing in the Capitol Building. Since then, it has met three times without posting any notice of the time or place of the meeting or allowing the public to attend.
Missouri governor’s parole study group urged to focus on transparency, fairness

The next meeting is Sept. 18, when according to one member the panel will present ideas in writing for inclusion in the working group’s report, due Oct. 1. 
“The working group is violating the Missouri Sunshine Law,” Amy Malinowski, Missouri director of the MacArthur Justice Center, said in an email to The Independent. “According to general counsel for the (Department of Corrections), they do not prepare agendas for or minutes from meetings. Nor do they publish notice of any meetings, whether open or closed. (It is) cruelly ironic since one of the things Gov. Kehoe asked this working group to focus on was transparency.”
Malinowski wrote several emails in July to the Division of Probation and Parole asking for notice of upcoming meetings. 
“Please be advised we are following all guidelines for this executive order and offered more than what was required by hosting an open public forum and creating a special email account for constituents to submit concerns and requests,” Glenda Owens, executive assistant to the Parole Board, wrote in reply.
When Malinowski responded by stating the working group needed to follow Sunshine Law guidelines for meeting notices, Owens disagreed.
“No public notice is required as it is not an open meeting,” Owens wrote.
A governmental body subject to the Sunshine Law must post a notice of the time and place it intends to meet, with an agenda of items to be discussed, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting. 
To hold a closed meeting, the body must first meet in public, with an agenda that cites specific exemptions in law that allow for closed meeting discussions. The body must hold a roll-call vote to go into a closed session.
The Sunshine Law also specifically includes “any advisory committee or commission appointed by the governor by executive order” in the definition of public governmental bodies.
That specific statement, said Dan Curry, legal advisor to the Missouri Press Association, makes the working group “subject to all Sunshine Law requirements.”
The Department of Corrections disagrees.
Spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Independent that parole board staff believe “the working group meetings are not public meetings/hearings.”
The executive order “does not require public hearings to be held — only to ensure that the working group includes a variety of stakeholders, including members of the public and formerly incarcerated people,” Pojmann said. “The public hearing held June 13 was an effort to get input from the public, as was the establishment of the email address for collecting public comment. Four meetings have been held so far, with a fifth planned for next month.”
Having the working group meet in secret violates the spirit of Kehoe’s executive order as well as the Sunshine Law, Malinowski said.
“It’s doubly concerning, because one of the specific issues they’re supposed to be working on is transparency,” she said. “How can we take seriously their recommendations with regard to transparency when they’re not taking seriously a very clear legal obligation regarding transparency?”
A spokeswoman for Kehoe did not respond to a request for comment. 
 Working group issues

Missouri has about 24,000 people incarcerated in the 19 adult prisons, with new admissions and releases each running at more than 11,000 per year. The Division of Probation and Parole had 13,809 men and women under parole supervision at the end of June 2024, the most recent data available.
In the brief public hearing, advocates for incarcerated people called on the group to bring more predictability to parole hearing dates, provide more feedback to people denied parole and shorten the time between a hearing and a release date.
They also asked the working group to look at how new interpretations of existing rules have added years, and sometimes decades, to the time required before parole eligibility.
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

The boundaries on the working group’s recommendations are things that can be done through revisions to regulations. Tony Helfrecht, the chairman of the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, is leading the working group and he said at the public hearing that it would not be considering recommendations for changing state law.
The regulations define the portion of a sentence that must be served before parole eligibility. They also define the structure of parole hearings such as who can speak or have representation, and the conditions a person on parole must meet to remain out of prison.
Helfrecht’s vice-chair is Trevor Foley, director of the state corrections department. Six other members are corrections department employees or members of the state parole board, and five represent the judiciary and law enforcement. Two public members, including Courtney Everett, program coordinator for the St. Louis University Prison Education Program, were previously incarcerated.
In an interview last week, Everett said the working group has met twice, in July and August, and will meet again on Sept. 18. He said he has asked for more public sessions, especially so people who have dealt with the parole system can testify.
“I’m just hearing stories that are blowing my mind, but everyone needs to hear it, and it’s difficult for me if I spent the hour with the mom, to take the notes and represent that in a Zoom meeting,” Everett said. “That’s just too hard for me to do.”
Everett said he was concerned that the working group would have an anti-inmate bias when he saw the list of members. 
“I went into this with a lot of trepidation, because I didn’t think we would be heard, but I feel like everyone’s listening,” Everett said. “I feel like everyone’s open-minded.”
The public should know what issues the working group considers important and what resources are being used to address them, Malinowski said. The MacArthur Justice Center has identified several areas to work on and she presented them at the public hearing.
“Who knows when we’ll get another opportunity like this to take a hard look at the regulations and change things?” Malinowski said. “Even the chairman himself described it as a once in a decade opportunity. So I want assurances that they’re making the most out of that opportunity, and, right now, I have none.”
 Next steps

Everett said in an interview that he would like the working group to get an extension on the Oct. 1 deadline.
“This is something that should take longer than a few months,” Everett said. “It’s just so much. There’s so many layers to it. We can’t do it in six months.”
The MacArthur Justice Center is weighing whether to take legal action over the Sunshine Law issues, Malinowski said.
One barrier, she said, is that the lawsuit would take far longer than the time left before the working group issues its report. The department has stopped responding to her on the open meetings questions, she said.
“They are not posting public notices of meetings. They are not preparing agendas for meetings,” Malinowski said. “They are not maintaining minutes of meetings. Yet these are all things the Missouri Sunshine law requires them to do. How, then, can we have any confidence in the forthcoming recommendations from the group?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jefferson-City-Correctional-Center-04022025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

Emanuel Cleaver said Monday he will see them in court. 
Speaking to reporters at a Labor Day event in Kansas City on Monday, the 11-term Democratic congressman said he has no intention of going quietly into the night as the GOP targets his seat. 
Asked if he’s committed to running for another term representing the 5th District — even if Republicans break it up into multiple districts — Cleaver said: “I’m committed to going to federal court.”
“I mean, I’m not committing to lay down and talk about running, unless I’m running to the lawyer’s office,” Cleaver told reporters. “We’re going to file a lawsuit.”
Cleaver suggested the fact that the map would rely on outdated population figures may violate the U.S. Constitution. Other Democrats contend the new map would also run into issues with the Missouri Constitution.
On Friday, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back to the Capitol this week to redraw the state’s congressional map. 
Missouri governor calls lawmakers back to Capitol to gerrymander congressional map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with two held by Democrats. The new map would split Kansas City, which is currently entirely in the 5th District, into three districts where Republicans would have an electoral edge. 
The intended result is a map where the GOP holds nearly 90% of the state’s seats in the U.S. House.
The current map was drawn in 2022, following the U.S. Census. 
Mid-decade redistricting is rare. In Missouri, it hasn’t happened since the 1960s. But President Donald Trump, facing a potentially difficult midterm election cycle next year, has demanded GOP-controlled states redraw maps to add more Republican seats. 
On Friday, Trump praised Kehoe for calling the legislature back into session and instructed state lawmakers to pass the new map “AS IS” without any changes. 
Cleaver said the way the districts are drawn makes it clear the map released by the governor’s office was drawn by the White House. 
“The White House designed the map,” he said. “This map was not drawn in Missouri.”
For proof, Cleaver said look no further than the fact that the Kansas City School District is split between two districts.
“That’s absolutely crazy,” he said. 
In unveiling the new map, Kehoe insisted it was “drawn and created” by his team in Missouri.

But that's proving easier said than done for the rapidly developing, and shifting, technology.","Frederick County public schools superintendent Cheryl Dyson talks with a student at Gov. Thomas Johnson High School last week, during the first day of school for students in the county. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Brayden Morgan says artificial intelligence is here to stay and everyone should embrace it.
“We have to adapt. We have to stay up to date,” said the 17-year-old high school senior and student member on the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. “We have to learn about it and make sure our students know how to use it [the] right way [and] that they’re learning and not being enabled on technology.”
That may be easier said than done.
The technology better known as “AI” is already being used by students and teachers in Maryland schools. But the state has yet to develop specific statewide guidelines on how to effectively use the powerful new computing tool, and what guardrails to protect students from using it inappropriately such as plagiarism on essay papers and other work.
State education officials have been working behind the scenes for more than a year on language, and county school systems have made tentative steps toward developing their own policies. But it’s been slow going.

Jing Liu said there’s a couple of reasons many school districts in Maryland, and the nation, don’t yet have artificial intelligence policies in place.
“The AI space is developing really, really fast. All the AI tools are developed at lightning speed,” said Liu, an associate professor in education policy at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Liu, who’s also directs the school’s Center for Educational Data Science and Innovation, said evidence-based research needs to be done quickly to help inform policymakers and school district leaders on how to design AI policy. He said a policy would include certain tools used to meet education standards and guardrails to ensure appropriate uses.
“I think we are still at a very early stage in terms of understanding their [AI] impact,” Liu said. “There hasn’t been a lot of research looking at the impact of particular AI users on teacher and student learning outcomes.”
Maryland education officials said they have been working behind the scenes on AI guidance for more than a year.
A document from the state Board of Education summarizes artificial intelligence frameworks such as potential benefits like tutoring and personalized learning assistance, aiding creativity and collaboration and operational and administrative efficiency. Some of the risks are plagiarism and academic dishonesty, overreliance and loss of critical thinking, and perpetuating societal biases.
State Superintendent Carey Wright said in an interview Thursday that statewide guidance on AI could be released by the end of the school. In the meantime, Wright has advice for educators and other school leaders on effectively using AI in schools.
“The things that I would hope they’re doing is developing lesson plans that are aligned to our standards. That’s key because our statewide assessment is aligned to our standards,” she said.
“We don’t want just a hodgepodge of things being taught,” Wright said. “So, anything that they can do that is going to make their life easier, but also guiding children in [what’s] appropriate and what’s not appropriate, in terms of the use of AI.”
School district look
A few school districts have implemented AI guidelines.
Prince George’s County school leaders began a three-year implementation plan last school year that stresses professional learning, ethical considerations and curriculum integration.
State Board of Education requests cell phone use policies, won’t mandate them

For the 2025-26 school year that began last week, there will be follow-up meetings with stakeholders, training workshops for staff and school administrators to start assessing how to implement AI instruction in the classroom.
Students in Calvert County can read about it in their new student code of conduct. The guidelines highlight definitions, educational and ethical uses, academic integrity and supervision and monitoring.
There’s also a warning for prohibited conduct: “Any misuse of AI tools will be subject to disciplinary action. In certain circumstances, law enforcement may be notified.”
Frederick County Superintendent Cheryl Dyson said the school board there is working on an artificial intelligence policy.
Last year, Dyson said curriculum writers used AI to generate topics related to the curriculum that young people would be interested in.
As for teachers, Dyson said they will not only know whether students produced their own work, but also help guide them to think critically.
“When you learn [the abilities of] a student, you can tell when something is an anomaly,” she said. “It’s really about explicit teaching of the writing process, or any process really about learning, because we want to know what they [students] know, not what the computer knows.”
Maryland State Education Association president Paul Lemle provided an example on how he utilized AI last year as a social studies teacher. Lemle asked students to compare a few political ads, but he also required that they make ads of their own.
“It was OK for them to use AI in that assignment,” he said. “If they wanted to use it to research the ads that they were comparing, fine. If they wanted to use it to suggest lines in their script, fine.
“But the AI couldn’t tell them this kind of ad will work in this kind of political context. They had to make that decision for themselves,” Lemle said.










One thing about AI is that it’s a genie that’s out of the bottle. We’re not going to place that back.


– Darilyn Mercadel, program coordinator, elementary education, Bowie State University College of Education


Tiffany Carpenter, 25, said she began to use artificial intelligence during the first week of school to help with a lesson plan for the entrepreneurship class she teaches at Dr. Henry A. Wise Jr. High School in Prince George’s County. Part of that plan, she said, was utilizing AI to design a logo.
“AI’s logo-making isn’t always perfect, so I just use that as a template so that I can get a start,” said Carpenter, who’s going into her fourth year teaching at Wise. “It’s giving you ideas, not the final product. That’s what I tell and show my students. AI is just a tool to help. They still have to do the work and learn from it.”
But without a 100% guarantee, there remains an unknown that students can utilize that technology and easily obtain good grades.
‘Do more together’
With an ongoing statewide and nationwide teacher shortage, aspiring teachers will need to be taught about how to effectively integrate artificial intelligence into the classroom.
Darilyn Mercadel is doing just that at Bowie State University, where she is teaching several classes and is the coordinator of elementary education programs in the school’s College of Education.
Before students are enrolled in college, high school students already know how to use AI technology through computer programs such as ChatGPT, developed and released in 2022 by OpenAI. ChatGPT can translate complex topics into simpler sentences. In addition, the user can ask questions through text, audio or even image prompts.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Mercadel stressed there’s other programs such as Adobe Firefly that generate graphics and edit photos; Intellectus that analyzes and breaks down data; and the “Siri voice recognition program on iPhones.
Mercadel said students use a tutoring service program called “CircleIn.” Not only does the program provide academic support, it can also be used to collaborate with their peers. But to ensure aspiring educators, which she calls “preservice students,” understand a particular topic, Mercadel will also give an oral exam.
“There are other means that we can assess students besides your usual paper, or your typical test that we used to give before AI,” she said. “One thing about AI is that it’s a genie that’s out of the bottle. We’re not going to place that back.”
The effectiveness of AI has decreased Mercadel’s time to plan her courses from about two weeks to an hour. She stressed the human element is integrated because “AI can’t do things that humans can do, which is the emotional side and the understanding of our students. It gives me more time to get to know my students and families.”
Mercadel, who taught early childhood education in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, said another positive with AI is interacting with students who may be hearing impaired.
“Now students are able to swipe that doesn’t require that occupational hand holding of a pencil and can tap or swipe to communicate. That’s a huge difference,” she said. “It’s assistive technology. We have these tools that make it easier, but that also gives us time to do more together.”



ChatGPT says it’s OK
As a polic, Maryland Matters does not use AI to write stories, but we did ask ChatGPT, one of the most popular programs, if AI should be allowed in K-12 classrooms for students and teachers. We were told in a split-second, “Yes … with clear boundaries, ethical safeguards, and developmentally appropriate practices in place.” Which it went on to list:
Why AI should be allowed in K-12
1. Enhances teaching and learning

For Teachers:

Saves time (e.g., grading drafts, generating lesson plans, adapting materials).
Enables differentiated instruction and support for diverse learners.


For Students:

Offers personalized learning (e.g., adaptive math platforms).
Improves accessibility (e.g., AI captioning, translation for ELLs).
Can support creativity and exploration (e.g., storytelling, art, simulations).



2. Builds essential future-ready skills

AI literacy will be as critical as digital literacy.
Students need to understand AI’s capabilities, limits, and ethical dimensions.
Introducing AI responsibly prepares students for a workforce increasingly shaped by automation and machine learning.

3. Promotes equity (if managed carefully)

With proper funding and access, AI can help close gaps in learning support.
It can provide real-time feedback and scaffolding for students who need it most.

But use must be carefully controlled
AI should not be used indiscriminately. The risks of misuse, bias, over-reliance and data misuse are real, especially for younger students. Uses, by grade level, should be:

Kindergarten-2nd grader should use teacher-controlled tools for tasks like speech-to-text, storoy generation and reading apps.
Grades 3-5 should have high supervision with AI image tools, math help and idea generation.
Grades 3-8 call for guided creative and assistive use for essay feedback, science simulations, chatbots.
Grades 9-12 allow responsible, independent use for research, peer review, coding help and ethical analysis.

When AI should not be used

For final grading decisions or disciplinary choices.
As substitute for human connection, mentorship, or social-emotional support.
In a surveillance capacity (e.g., emotion tracking, behavior prediction).
Without full transparency with parents and students.

Final position: Allow AI, with guardrails
AI belongs in the classroom — not as a replacement for teachers or learning, but as a tool for enhancing both. Its use must be:

Age-appropriate
Ethically grounded
Transparent
Optional and opt-in where appropriate
Accompanied by teacher training and student AI literacy education

On a scorching Monday in August, I participated in a consequential conversation on the energy crisis facing our state and learned about the actual contributors to inhibitive cost increases.
At an event hosted by STONO Public Affairs, 30 faith leaders from around the state conversed with the president of the Board of Public Utilities, Christine Guhl-Sadovy, about the impact of rising electric bills on New Jersey’s low-income communities and what programs exist to help customers experiencing devastating challenges paying their bills.
New Jersey offers a range of assistance programs that, unfortunately, few people know exist or how to access. As someone who hears from congregants and community members every day about their financial struggles, I commend STONO and the Board of Public Utilities for jointly organizing this event to make visible the people hurting most acutely from this reprehensible energy crisis.
This moment of affordability chaos necessitates that faith communities, government, and community-based organizations do more to bridge the gap and raise awareness around these programs, as our neighbors and family members suffocate under the tightening squeeze of unchecked energy costs.
Every year, we see more days with extreme temperatures due to climate change, with historically Black, brown, and low-income communities living in sections of towns where temperatures are 7 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in more affluent communities inhabited by white people. The combination of extreme weather and escalating power costs uniquely compounds the health and financial crises that countless families struggling to get by know all too intimately. 
While improving outreach to communities about available assistance will help to stop the bleeding, we, likewise, have a moral obligation to address the root cause of this odious crisis. A growing consensus among utility providers, academics, and advocates alike continues to take shape concerning the direct link between our rising energy costs and increased demand due to the rapid expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence. Despite agreement on the causes, there is little discussion about long-term solutions to these escalating costs for those who can least afford them.
The expert class, business leaders, and everyday users laud artificial intelligence as the most tremendous technological advancement since the advent of the internet. Companies are stampeding forward to invest in their own AI systems, claiming it will lead to innovation across sectors and ultimately yield a big payday for countless people. The unfortunate side effect of this promising new sector is the massive amounts of energy AI data centers use.
At the onset of this new technological revolution that portends to amplify creativity and generate unimaginable wealth, we should be equally creative in our attempts to meet this moment differently than we did at the onset of the internet. Rather than allowing this revolution to overburden and punish the vulnerable, we should find creative ways for it to subsidize those who will see repressive upticks in expenses due to the actions of techno-capitalists. For people living paycheck to paycheck, a 20% increase on a $200 to $300 electric bill is enough to break the bank.
We must find ways for this technology to be an unadulterated good for everyone instead of a burden for low-income people merely trying to get by. It’s sinful to tie our hands, bury our heads in the sand, or permit our tongues to cling to the roofs of our mouths while corporations get rich on the backs of working families. 
We are not asking companies to stop pursuing innovation and teasing out new possibilities from AI. We’re simply asking these corporations to pay their fair share. If the industry intends to endure, data-center developers — makers of these humming plants of consumption — must chip in for wide-reaching and systematic utility assistance and invest in the infrastructure necessary to support their energy demands. Sustainability for these companies looks like returning something to the people who make their profits possible.
What opportunities did we miss before the dawn of the internet and social media to ensure that they would be assets and not burdens to the rest of society? What tax considerations did we miss that would have benefited the least among us and the innovators who created the technology? 
We obviously missed opportunities for fairness and justice at the dawn of the internet, but the stakes are too high now for us to allow history and the present to rhyme by repeating the same mistakes. We know more about the causes and effects of climate change alongside the polarizing residual effects of technological advancements like social media. We can ill-afford another revolution to happen without drawing clear guidelines to ensure the titans of industry pull their weight. 
The gravity of this swelling crisis calls for an economics of repair as the only legitimate moral response to reinforce the undying dignity of hardworking people straining to make month and money meet. No one working two jobs and driving Uber to keep the heat and hope on should bear the cost of increased demand usage by the billionaire data center industry. In fact, it should be the opposite: A family should enjoy financial relief on their utility bill because this billion-dollar industry is able to exist. We have a chance to do things right this time around. Let’s not squander it.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Nearly 1,000 state employees are waiting to learn if they will be allowed to quit their jobs under a voluntary separation that aims to shrink the size of state government and cut expenses.
Of the thousands who were notified of the early out program in July, a total of 980 employees had applied by the Aug. 4 deadline, state officials said.
Not all of them will be allowed to quit. The state is reviewing the applications and decisions will be based on “the mission and priorities of the agency and … an evaluation of whether the function of the position is required,” a spokesperson for Gov. Wes. Moore (D) said in an email. Workers also have to have worked at least two years for the state to take advantage of the program.
The Department of Budget and Management plans to notify employees in mid-September of whether their application for separation has been accepted or not. When they unveiled the program in late June, administration officials insisted that they did not have a specific target in mind for the number of workers they were hoping would leave, only that it was one part of a larger effort to cut $121 million in state personnel expenses.
“The VSP [voluntary separation program] is one of several actions the governor has implemented to achieve the $121 million reduction, including the hiring freeze already announced,” a DBM spokesperson said in an email when the program was announced.

While they could not predict how many might ultimately be accepted into the buyout program, the governor’s office said similar voluntary separation program in 2015 realized a 38% acceptance rate.
According to details on the DBM website, the buyout offer, first announced in late June, was available to full-time employees in the executive branch with at least two years of service. Those accepted will get $20,000, plus an additional $300 for each year of service. The state will cover six months of paid state health benefits after their separation, and departing workers will also be paid for any unused leave and compensatory time.
Workers who take the buyout have to agree not to work for the state again for at least another 18 months, and their positions will be eliminated once they leave.
There were nearly 52,000 positions within the state personnel and Maryland Department of Transportation personnel systems, about 4,800 of which were vacant as of May, the DBM spokesperson said at the time. About 13,500 are in job classifications that are not eligible for the buyout offer, including police and correctional officers, judicial and legislative employees, and close to 60 other offices, ranging from the Attorney Grievance Commission to the Canal Place Preservation and Development Authority.
Workers at the state’s colleges and universities are also ineligible, although the executive order creating the program allows several of the universities to set up their own buyout programs if they wish.
Of the 980 workers who applied for the porogram, 862 were employed as part of the State Personnel Management System and the remaining 118 were employed by the Maryland Department of Transportation, according to an administration spokesperson
DBM spokesperson Raquel Coombs said last month that a more specific breakdown of the departments the applicants came from was confidential.
Representatives for both the American Federation of Teachers-Maryland and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said their unions were waiting for more information on the breakdown of employees.
The governor’s office had originally proposed eliminating 150 vacant government positions, implementing a hiring freeze and offering some buyouts to meet the $121 million personnel cost reductions that were mandated as part of the fiscal 2026 budget approved by the General Assembly this spring.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But lawmakers and union representatives differed from the administration on what personnel cuts were required, and they specifically pushed back against the notion of layoffs.
AFSCME said several critical “24/7” agencies — hospitals, public safety and prisons, for example — are already understaffed and covering vacancies with overtime, and insisted that any further personnel reductions not cut into service.
“Any solutions to help our state navigate these tough and volatile times must not come at the cost of providing quality state services,” the union said in a statement when the buyouts were announced.
Besides trimming personnel, the union said the state should look at “eliminating costly contracts, in-sourcing services where needed, addressing other inefficiencies, and closing corporate tax loopholes to raise much-needed state revenues” to cut costs.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/state-house-flag-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Courtesy photo)Tamiqua Whittaker was inspired to launch her homemade cosmetics business while working full time in the dental field.
Watching her patients struggle with dry lips during and after checkups inspired the Tulsa resident to develop her first homemade cosmetic product, an all-natural lip scrub. 
To ensure her products are safe and effective on different ages and skin types, she tests them on herself, her children and her husband. She also researches industry standards, and her background has taught her best practices in sterilization and how to prevent cross-contamination.
Building on the success of her lip balm, Whittaker created the brand Queen Kisses and scaled it up to a three-part lip restoration system that includes lip exfoliators, balms and a nighttime aloe mask consisting of less than five certified organic or locally sourced ingredients from makers or growers in Tulsa or surrounding areas. 
“What sets my business apart is that I am a licensed dental professional who started this endeavor, so I have the experience and knowledge necessary for caring for such a sensitive and important part of your face,” Whittaker said.
Whittaker’s lip balms are a part of a quickly growing but largely under regulated sector in Oklahoma and nationally – the handmade cosmetic industry.

The market for natural cosmetics in the United States is expected to grow by nearly 71% by 2030 and reach almost $1.1 billion, according to a 2024 analysis by the Chemical Abstracts Service. The group, which aims to connect scientific knowledge to accelerate breakthroughs, said more consumers are shunning mainstream products, which contain synthetic chemicals, in favor of natural, sustainable and customized products. The growth of social media has also opened up opportunities for small business owners to showcase and pitch their homemade products to large numbers of people.
But experts, including the Food and Drug Administration, warn that the handmade cosmetic industry is a buyer-beware market for consumers. Because there is little state and federal oversight of the burgeoning industry, they acknowledge that some homemade cosmetics could be misbranded or contaminated because they don’t have to be approved before use. 
An FDA spokesperson said the federal agency does not approve cosmetics before they are sold but does regulate them after they become available on the market. 
“The FDA does not provide specific resources or educational programs for small or home-based cosmetic producers,” an agency spokesperson said. “As a regulatory agency, our priority with regard to cosmetics is ensuring that products are unadulterated and properly labeled.”
In Oklahoma, the State Board of Cosmetology and Barbering is responsible for the protection and education of consumers who perform cosmetology services. The agency provides proper training for applicants and requires them to pass a written and practical examination. 
If a consumer has a complaint about a business or product, they can submit it to the state board. The complaint will then be reviewed and acted upon if necessary. 
The agency did not comment about how it regulates handmade cosmetics.
Whittaker, though, said the state board primarily leaves regulation to the FDA, and it’s up to small business owners to stay abreast of the latest compliance regulations and requirements. She supports the current regulatory levels because she might not have been able to grow her home brand from nothing if the state had more stringent regulations.

“Too many regulations could make the entrepreneurship dream a bit more of a reach for those aspiring,” Whittaker said. “Too many regulations ensure certain (items and ingredients) are unobtainable by us common folk capable of creating our own success, and even further limit options for those of us brave enough to attempt entrepreneurship.”
But she acknowledged there are bad actors in her industry, which local and state agencies struggle to regulate.
“That’s really a Catch-22 answer,” Whittaker said. “Too many regulations hurt us honest business owners, but not enough creates issues for consumers.” 
Ken Marenus, president and CEO of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, said the industry is oversaturated with personal care brands, and small businesses often struggle to find ways to stand out. 
But the growing competition hasn’t deterred LaVonda Robinson, an entrepreneur and CEO of Growing Hands LLC.
“My passion and happiness in my job is seeing the hair grow back and remain healthy,” she said. Robinson, of Tulsa, creates hair growth oils that are tailored to meet specific needs of each of her clients because there wasn’t one specific product on the market that could accommodate them all. 
“I wanted to make a product that was safe and that helped maintain that natural, healthy look and feel,” she said. 
Robinson said there are plenty of similar products being “marketed as healthy and effective,” and while she’s sure about the safety of her product, she isn’t as confident about others on the market.
“(My) question is, ‘Are they really safe, and do they really work?” she said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/OklahomaVoice)A four-member, state board tasked with overseeing the investment of nearly $2 billion intended to make Oklahoma healthier has suddenly decided it’s also the morality police, and our last line of defense against the “dubious values” of corporations.
This mighty band of self-styled superheroes disguised as mild-mannered bankers and accountants refuses to be deterred by the pesky fact that we – thankfully and intentionally – don’t actually have a formal set of state values.
Chock full of delusions of grandeur and hyperbolic fearmongering, the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust board of investors, led by state Treasurer Todd Russ, is convinced that 10 major corporations could open them up to backlash. They’re concerned that these businesses could potentially face litigation that could endanger the worth of the endowment’s investments.
They didn’t say which companies they’re talking about during their Aug. 20 meeting, although Russ has acknowledged that they’re so profitable that it doesn’t make financial sense for the board to divest itself of them right now. 
So instead, the board is using our money to try to force shareholders to vote on changing a bunch of policies including “anti-trafficking,” charitable giving “discrimination” and the dispensing of prescription medications.
And adding insult to injury, the board described unnamed companies that everyday Oklahomans have voluntarily chosen to do business with — like a credit card company, a major aerospace company that has a location in the heart of Oklahoma City, and a nationwide wholesaler that dispenses prescription medication at discount prices.
Based on the hypothetical examples they tossed around during a public meeting, this seems like a bizarre and ill-thought out crusade that will do little more than make Oklahoma look ridiculous – again.
By their estimation, a big box store  is selling so much of the drug mifepristone that it could wind up affecting pregnancy rates. Yes, by their calculations, allowing a woman more control over when she becomes pregnant means fewer kids, which equals fewer diapers sold, which could, in turn, harm TSET’s overall investment returns.
What?
That’s rich coming from a board that works on behalf of an entity whose mission is to improve public health and distributes millions each year to achieve that (the endowment has taken credit for the state’s plummeting cigarette smoking rate for the past two decades, for instance). Yet, the board that is tasked with managing their money apparently doesn’t understand the value of doctor-patient relationships or the fact that mifepristone is used for other purposes than medical abortions.
This board also spouted off some bizarre theory that a major credit card company could be complicit in the distribution of images of child sexual abuse by allowing customers to use credit cards to pay for the illegal images. Yet, if this board had bothered to read the fine print on their credit card agreements, they’d know that reputable credit card companies explicitly prohibit the use of credit cards for anything against the law. Plus, if this were a widespread problem, wouldn’t the authorities already be investigating? 
And if that wasn’t enough, they’re also apparently fearful that a big, scary aerospace company might have diversity, equity and inclusion policies that could affect their bottom line and potentially cause them to lose federal contracts. Yet, they seem perfectly happy to forget that ours is a state that isn’t graduating enough engineering majors to meet demand.
Is it any wonder that multinational companies don’t want to come to Oklahoma?
Why does a state board believe that it needs to lead the charge to fix perceived ills? If there’s one thing the public is very good at, it’s speaking with their money – or their social media accounts. 
Just ask Cracker Barrel.
The restaurant chain unveiled a new modernized logo last month, which incurred the public wrath. Shareholders rebelled, and the company’s value plummeted nearly $100 million. Stocks quickly rebounded after Cracker Barrel abandoned the effort. 
So why would the endowment investment board do this now?
It turns out our investor board wasn’t acting under a directive from lawmakers, the governor or anyone else, Russ has said. So, they were acting simply because they wanted to.
That is scary in itself. But don’t forget they’re appointed by our state House and Senate leaders, the state auditor and the governor. The chair — our state treasurer — is elected by us all.
Only the state auditor’s appointee had the gumption to push back against this campaign. He told his fellow board members that this isn’t the best way to do business.
These shenanigans, by the way, happened while lawmakers and the governor are trying to flex their power and have greater influence over TSET board of director appointees. I wasn’t really sure why that was a bad thing until this clown show happened. I suspect this is probably exactly why voters wanted lawmakers to have limited influence on how tobacco settlement money is spent.
Ironically, an adviser who spoke at the meeting said that it is “activists” bringing public pressure that often shapes company policies. The Oklahoma board’s plans offer shareholders an alternative, he said.
Merriam-Webster defines activist as “a person who uses or supports strong actions (such as public protests) in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial issue.”
In a stroke of beautiful irony, this board has become the kind of people they purport to fear.
So maybe these investors should leave the politicking and lobbying to the people we’re actually paying to do it.
Because you know what could harm this endowment’s returns by opening it up to litigation? Taking questionable public votes that potentially violate the Open Meeting Act by posting vague, secretive agendas, and using our public funds as leverage to try to shove the board’s own “values” down the throats of multinational corporations that seem to be doing just fine without the assistance of these “superheroes.”

Comprehensive consumer privacy laws are taking effect in eight states this year. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center. Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

Ninety-two years after George Brimmer spearheaded a statewide effort to create town parks, his grandson boosted the family legacy.
The post Wallace’s Grand Teton National Park conservation rivals his grandfather’s Jackson Town Square appeared first on WyoFile .","To celebrate the 200th anniversary of George Washington’s birthday, a Wyoming gubernatorial committee in 1932 rallied towns across the state to create city parks in memory of the nation’s first president. In a widely successful campaign, one of the many places set aside was the 1.09-acre Town Square in Jackson, now enjoyed by millions of visitors every year.
Back then, “town authorities” designated Block One of the Clubhouse Addition as a park, the town nurtured park-appropriate “plant material” and citizens, “by private subscription,” raised $150 for landscaping and other work.
Commission chair George Brimmer relayed the success to Cheyenne in 1933, documenting the end of the board’s official work — with a caveat. As private citizens, commission members would “continue until there is a full consummation of the plans.”
Brimmer, a Riverton attorney schooled in law at New York City’s Columbia University and awed by that metropolis’s Central Park, might not have imagined a legacy larger than the elk-antler-arch Jackson Town Square — an international icon visited by masses on the way to Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.
“I knew after that summer I wanted to be part of the parks in this part of the world.” Rob Wallace
Ninety-two years on, however, private citizens’ work continues. And Brimmer’s grandson may have bested the old man by 638.91 acres.
The Teton Science Schools will honor grandson Rob Wallace today with the Murie Spirit of Conservation Award, recognizing years of public-lands advocacy and his “most consequential” achievement — playing an instrumental role in the preservation of the Kelly Parcel in Grand Teton National Park.
“It’s something nobody will know about,” Wallace said of the conservation struggle he aided from just offstage. “It was a series of very interesting things that all went right at the same time.”
Murie legacy
The Science Schools celebration honors national and local conservation leaders and this year also recognizes Amy Brennan McCarthy, CEO of the Teton Raptor Center, who will be named a “local legend.” She is a wildlife conservation leader recognized for ecosystem science-oriented community programming.
The Science Schools will bestow the awards at the Murie Ranch in Grand Teton where Mardy Murie, called the country’s “mother of conservation,” along with her family and others conceived the modern conservation movement.
Wallace followed a winding path as he wended his way toward the recognition. An Evanston youth whose father was an attorney and mother, Nancy Wallace, was a two-term representative in the Wyoming Legislature, he found delight as a youth in the Uinta Mountains and Medicine Bow National Forest.

And also rascality with his sophomore townie high school buddies. It wasn’t a single illicit party that made his mother put her foot down.
“It was more than one,” he said.
She settled on him spending his last two high school years in the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico. 
“She thought I might have a better chance for a little more focused life if I left Evanston for a couple of years,” Wallace said.
Focus he did, attending the University of Texas studying petroleum engineering. After college and before a required ROTC Army stint, he got a position as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton National Park.
“I had a job before they had standards,” he said. “It was an epiphany. I knew after that summer I wanted to be part of the parks in this part of the world.”
Into the parks
After brief Army service, Wallace spent four years as a seasonal park ranger, “paid to be outdoors, on the rivers, climbing mountains, riding horses,” he said.
He also saw the policy makers – senators, congressmen, cabinet members – drift through Grand Teton on dutiful sojourns. “How do these people come up with these policies,” he wondered about the far-from-Wyoming beltway bunch.
Serendipity took him to a Cheyenne rally where Malcolm Wallop was launching an improbable Senate run against Gale McGee. Wallace accepted an on-the-spot offer to be the first on Wallop’s campaign staff.
McGee sought his fourth term. “You had to be crazy to take him on,” Wallace said. But Wallop “just caught the wave — sort of the early years of the sagebrush rebellion.”

Myriad jobs in public land policy and energy followed. He was back in Wyoming for a few years working on a water project, was Wallop’s chief of staff and Republican staff director for the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
He jumped at the chance to work for the National Park Service as head of congressional affairs, shepherding a policy that allowed parks to keep 80% of the fees charged at entrance stations.
He ran for Congress in 1994, coming in second in the primary to Barbara Cubin. Jim Geringer, who was also in the race, eventually won election as Wyoming governor and tapped Wallace as chief of staff.
There’s more: 17 years seeing the world with General Electric, then unanimously confirmed by the Senate as assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks at the U.S. Department of the Interior, a post he held from 2019 to 2021.
Independent conservation
Along the way Wallace kept his hand in independent conservation. He helped launch several Wyoming initiatives and was a founding member of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation.
That group forged a new Park Service policy in the early 2000s allowing independent nonprofits to boost park projects. Until then, “all things we find important were centrally planned in the Denver Service Center,” he said. “They would pass that down from Heaven.” The construction of the Craig Thomas Visitor Center “proved that [new] model worked,” Wallace said.
Preserving the Kelly Parcel, his “most consequential” achievement, was a drama with a large cast of characters and a tortured plot. It involved the entire Legislature as the chorus and leading roles by Gov. Mark Gordon, Wyoming Sen. Mike Gierau and Wyoming Treasurer Curt Meier.
“There were so many different near-death experiences during that time,” he said of the purchase.
The Legislature for years considered selling the 640-acre Wyoming school section that covered a critical migration crossroads inside Grand Teton. Debate swirled over whether it should go to the park or be put on the block for the highest bid and potential private development.
By law, the federal government couldn’t spend more than the $62.4 million appraised value for the square-mile section. Wyoming lawmakers believed they could get more at auction. One raised the bid, proposing $100 million.
With Wyoming’s price set, conservationists huddled – “Who’s going to call Leslie?”
That’s the indefatigable Leslie Mattson, head of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. Her mission, and she chose to accept it, was to raise $37.6 million in a few months to make up the difference and meet an end-of-2024 legislative deadline.
At a nail-biting Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners’ meeting in November 2024, Treasurer Meier cast the deciding vote in favor of the sale.
Mom was right
“Curt Meier was the hero in my mind,” Wallace said. The treasurer agreed the plan met all conditions the Legislature imposed on the sale. “Curt did his homework and said, ‘I’m with you too,’” Wallace said.
Then came “a race across Wyoming,” a modern-day Pony Express.
Jason Crowder, deputy director of the state land office, “took off with the deed and papers,” Wallace said. He met Jeremy Barnum, Grand Teton’s chief of staff, in Shoshoni.
It was a scene out of a spy movie, Wallace said, a rural settlement in a windswept winter landscape with “two guys in heavy coats swapping documents.”
With that, the Brimmer/Wallace legacy stood at 641.09 acres, all perhaps because of a Wyoming state representative from Evanston who set her son on the straight-and-narrow.
Wallace might have missed some bender high school parties in Evanston, but acknowledges his mom’s wisdom.
“She was right,” he said.

Colorado, which sued, retained 10 of 11 grant terminations, while neighboring Wyoming retained none.
The post Blue states that sued kept most CDC grants, while red states feel brunt of Trump clawbacks appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration’s cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks and hire community health workers.
Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.

The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
The money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.

In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”
Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
Aston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
The Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.
The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent COVID money coming back.”
Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis and more.
Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.
The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.


Methodology
KFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods. 
This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

Property taxes are a big issue in Wyoming, but not everyone wants more tax breaks that come with a huge price, columnist Kerry Drake writes. 
The post Hi, we’re from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and we’re not here to help you appeared first on WyoFile .","I stood in line at the Freedom Caucus Complaint Department for hours, watching woke people tell the clerk what they thought of his politics and then leave in a huff. Finally it was my turn.

Opinion

“Hello, what can I do to — I mean for — you today?” said the clerk, a balding old conservative white guy. I forget his name, but it really doesn’t matter because they all think and vote alike anyway.
“I’m here today about property taxes,” I said.
“Oh, no need to thank us,” he said, smiling. “We just did what all of Wyoming wanted us to do: cut your property taxes so you can spend your hard-earned money on something besides giving it to a government that doesn’t need it. 
“A vote for us next year is all the thanks we want. There are a lot more property tax cuts coming, I can assure you,” he said. “We’ve only just begun. Next!”
“No, no, I didn’t come to thank you,” I said. “I came because I want you to stop.”
A quizzical look came across his face. “I don’t understand,” the clerk said. “You didn’t like your property tax cut? We gave you several to choose from.
“There’s one for old people who’ve paid property taxes for at least 25 years, and a property tax refund program that we put more money into. Then there’s one for everybody, up to the first million dollars of your home’s value.”
“That’s part of the problem,” I said. “You gave us so many, it’s confusing. People don’t know what they qualify for.”
He chuckled. “Now I know where you’re coming from,” the clerk said. “We did that so people would complain, like you’re doing, so we could say, ‘Look folks, this tax system has gotten way out of control. What we need to do is get rid of all property taxes!’ That’s next on our agenda.”


“That’s the worst idea I’ve ever heard,” I said. “Giving us the across-the-board 25% cut you did would have been OK, as long as you put enough state money back in for local governments, special districts and schools to keep their budgets whole. But you didn’t, so they’ve had to cut.
“How are cities, towns and counties supposed to keep providing essential services, like law enforcement and fire protection, and fix roads?” I asked. “Then there’s a long list of special districts. Hospitals are closing their maternity wards, and some are at-risk of closing completely.”
The clerk cut me off. “I’m sure you’re aware, sir, that the Freedom Caucus knows all governments are too big, and the liberal elites will stop at nothing until they tax you to death,” he said. “We’ve said, ‘Enough! Use your reserves until they’re all gone, and then cut, cut, and then cut some more. People don’t need everything handed to them.”
I knew where this was leading. “But I pay property taxes for a reason,” I said. “I want an ambulance to come when I need it. I want parks, recreation and libraries in my town.”
He smiled again. “The Freedom Caucus wants libraries, too,” he said. “But we don’t want them filled with smut and sex stuff and books that suggest God created more than two genders. If you’d like, you can come back this afternoon and one of our Moms for Liberty can fill you in on our plans.”
“Oh, I already know your plans,” I said. “And I don’t like them one bit. You guys say you want freedom, but only for yourselves to tell the rest of us how to live. You even tell pregnant women they must deliver a baby, even if they’re a victim of rape or incest.”
The clerk held up his hand, and pointed at a sign on the wall: “One topic per complaint, please.”
“Very well, I’ll go back to property taxes,” I said. “Here’s my final complaint. Wyoming collects $2 billion in property taxes every year. If you take that away, how is anything going to be funded? Are you going to just raise the sales tax rate to a ridiculous amount, which means everyone but the rich must pay a huge percentage of their income for the services they now get from property taxes?”
The clerk clapped his hands and shouted, “Bingo!”
“You’re doing this just to keep getting elected, aren’t you?” I shouted. “If you win on one issue, you’re going to keep at it no matter what the consequences are.” 
“You sound like some of the people who came to a legislative committee meeting in Casper last week,” he replied, speaking in lower tones so I had to step closer to hear him. “They accused us of just playing politics with these property tax cuts to get elected.
“Frankly, it hurt some of our feelings,” he added, and pretended to sniffle, followed by an uproarious laugh.
“Now you’re mocking me,” I said. “This isn’t real, is it? Why in the world did I think the Freedom Caucus would have a complaint department? You only listen to yourselves.”
“Yes, you’re dreaming,” the clerk said. “But thanks for dropping by, and don’t bother to vote. Next!” Then he shoved my head backward, and I woke in bed.
“What a nightmare,” I thought, then tried to go back to sleep. It took a while, but when I finally dozed off, I found myself back in line at the complaint department. I guess I had more to say to that imaginary Freedom Caucus guy, and he’s the only one of that bunch who’d listen to me at all.

(Photo courtesy of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, Miami Field Office)More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.
Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

Aug. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The vice president and longest-serving member of Nebraska’s State Board of Education will not seek reelection in 2026.
Deb Neary of Omaha confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner that she will not seek a third four-year term. Neary, whose background has focused on nonprofit leadership and education research, said she is proud to have built a “reputation as a dynamic leader committed to driving positive change across multiple sectors.”
Reflecting on her service, Neary said she has been a “steadfast advocate” for student success, educational equity and strong support for Nebraska’s public schools.
“Serving on the State Board of Education has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Neary said in a statement. “I’ve had the privilege of working with parents, educators and community leaders across Nebraska to strengthen opportunities for every student, and I am proud of the progress we’ve made together.”

District 8 voters first elected Neary, a Democrat, in 2018 over incumbent Pat McPherson of Omaha, a Republican. The district is now in central Douglas County.
Health education and politics
Among Neary’s highlighted accomplishments is advocating for science-based, age-appropriate health education standards in 2021, which were ultimately not adopted. Nebraska is one of just two states without K-12 health education standards.
Neary said throughout the “often-contentious” debate that year, she prioritized constituent engagement through town halls and community forums while listening to parents and educators. 
The fight embroiled the officially nonpartisan ed board in national controversy and ignited a series of changes to the makeup of the State Board of Education. In part, the fight awakened a new crop of conservatives and progressives to participate more in state and local politics, including at the Nebraska Legislature and State Board.
The changes began in December 2021 when then-Gov. Pete Ricketts appointed conservative Kirk Penner of Aurora, a former local school board member of 16 years, to a vacancy on the State Board of Education.

Penner led a conservative slate of education candidates in the 2022 election, when half of the board’s seats were up for election. Penner and allies Sherry Jones of Grand Island and Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte sailed to victory, including Tegtmeier over an incumbent. Neary survived a close race against Penner-backed conservative challenger Marni Hodgen.
The Neary-Hodgen fight was among the nastiest in 2022, with supporters and opponents trading barbs, ads and social media posts accusing each other of lies and political extremism.
The 2022 elections left Republicans and Democrats with four seats on the board. One moderate Republican often helped break the gridlock by joining with Democratic members.
That tie-breaking vote helped the board vote 5-3 to select Brian Maher as the state’s new education commissioner in March 2023. Neary called the hiring process one of her proudest moments, with a leadership transition that she said has positioned the Nebraska Department of Education for increased stability and success in a “challenging political climate.”
A changing board
The board again went through major changes as a result of the 2024 election.
All four Democratic incumbents whose seats were up for election declined to run, some citing politics as a reason. While the board stayed split 4-4, voters elected a more reliably conservative member than the member replaced.
The departures left Neary as the longest-tenured incumbent, followed by Penner.

In January, it took 54 votes to elect a president of the board as Republicans and Democrats split 53 times between Tegtmeier and Neary. After the 53rd vote, Neary and Tegtmeier struck a deal to have Tegtmeier be reelected president on a couple of conditions: that Tegtmeier decline to run for president again in 2026 and that committee leadership and assignments be split by policy party affiliation.
With the deal struck, Tegtmeier and Neary received unanimous approval on the 54th and 55th votes for president and vice president.
The board still agrees more than it disagrees, including uniting around a few priorities with Maher — literacy, chronic absenteeism, and teacher and staff recruitment and retention. The board also unanimously voted this June to extend Maher’s contract by one year, to July 2027. In addition, all eight representatives this summer endorsed Maher’s short-lived 2026 campaign for the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, which recently ended.
Looking ahead to 2026, Penner also decided not to seek reelection. He and Neary have endorsed their favored candidates to succeed them.
‘Foundation of opportunity’
Neary said her time in office has been guided by evidence, equity and empathy around a handful of focuses:

Closing achievement gaps and expanding access to high-quality education for historically underserved students.
Defending public schools against what she described as disinformation campaigns and censorship efforts.
Elevating educators and students in policy decisions over partisanship.

She said the board has strengthened its focus on accountability and transparency since 2019.
“Education is the foundation of opportunity,” Neary said. “I will always be a passionate advocate for all Nebraska’s students, families and educators — and I will continue to work to ensure our schools remain among the best in the nation.”

Sherrye Hutcherson of Omaha, who has been with Bellevue University since 2018, publicly launched her campaign Tuesday. She said she is running because education is critical and prepares students for the future.
“It is the foundation for who we are as a country,” Hutcherson said.
Hutcherson is the first candidate to announce for the District 8 seat in central Douglas County since incumbent Deb Neary confirmed her intention not to seek a third four-year term. Neary endorsed Hutcherson.

The eight members of the State Board of Education generally oversee the Nebraska Department of Education. 
Hutcherson said she is a product of public school education and that her parents and many family members were public school teachers or administrators.
“I was the little girl swinging her leg at four years old in school board meetings,” Hutcherson said with a laugh.
Hutcherson said parents should have the choice to make the best decisions for their children, which she said Nebraska’s education system should support. 
She said Nebraska should be a state where all students can be educated, graduate and ultimately find the right job for them.
Those students can then raise families with a “quality life” and continue a cycle, Hutcherson said, which also uplifts the country and its economy.
If elected, Hutcherson said she would pick up where Neary leaves off on long-term Nebraska Department of Education and board goals to improve student literacy, reduce chronic absenteeism and recruit and retain more Nebraska teachers.
“I will be all in on setting these policies at the state level and supporting the school districts at the local level so they can achieve these objectives,” Hutcherson said.
Hutcherson said she believes “emphatically” in a state-local balance and that families must be able to provide input on how their children are educated. She said local and state leaders can “partner” to help students, and she said she doesn’t want to “meddle” in what superintendents and school boards do.

A successful four years in office would mean tackling board priorities, Hutcherson said, including getting more students to come to school more often and better enjoy coming to school. 
Hutcherson earned a degree in accounting from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff in 1993 and earned a master’s degree in business administration from Creighton University in 2001. She is currently working on a doctorate in interdisciplinary education leadership at Creighton.
Her work history includes Union Pacific Railroad, as a former senior vice president, chief human resources officer and corporate auditor; the Omaha Public Power District, as a former chief administrative officer and HR division manager, among other roles; the Omaha Small Business Network, as executive director and business development officer.
Hutcherson said her past 30 years have centered on objective decisions and policymaking that is representative and also focuses on the greater good.
In her endorsement of Hutcherson, Neary cited Hutcherson’s “exceptional background,” which includes work in education and in the community, including with the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. Neary said that work “uniquely positions her to lead with vision and balance.”
“Sherrye’s nonpartisan perspective and proven record of service will ensure that Nebraska continues to have a strong, forward-looking education system that meets the needs of all students,” Neary said of Hutcherson.
Hutcherson said she, like Neary, loves children, would fight for students and work to make the best decisions on behalf of students.
“Deb has been fabulous in that, and I will honor that and look forward to doing the exact same thing,” Hutcherson said.
The officially nonpartisan State Board of Education is currently split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats. Neary, board vice president, is a registered Democrat and won a close reelection in 2022 against a conservative challenger. 
Hutcherson is a registered nonpartisan.
A self-described collaborator, Hutcherson said her top goal will be to keep District 8 families and students at the forefront of all decisions and to use her voice. Hutcherson said board members need to be willing to listen to one another and work toward compromise. 
Said Hutcherson: “I would like to see myself be a part of that … and understand and have the complete facts around the issues that we are addressing … so that we can truly make the best decision for our students and our families in District 8 and in the state.”
The top two finishers in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 election.

(Getty Images)A task force of Idaho lawmakers is trying to zero in on potential legislative changes they could propose to address the complaints they receive about the state’s child custody and domestic relations system. 
Lawmakers will likely look to address how to handle imbalance in power and resources among parents who are challenging each other for custody of their children, and how to protect parents’ rights to see their children while balancing the safety of the child and keeping them out of potentially dangerous or abusive situations. 
Idaho Legislature’s panel looks to reform child custody laws

The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force met Thursday in Idaho Falls in a lengthy meeting with current and former judges, a trial administrator, a state health agency bureau chief, and three hours of public testimony regarding residents’ personal experiences with child custody battles. 
The task force members questioned family law experts on ways to improve financial inequality in cases, boost enforcement of court ordered custody plans, and appeal or provide oversight over judges making these decisions. 
“Our purpose here is to consider the law, how it’s being applied and whether it should change,” task force co-chair Rep. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, said at the beginning of Thursday’s meeting. 
Nichols noted that legislators weren’t there to “second guess” the decisions of individual judges, although dismay at judicial decisions in these matters were at the center of much of the three hours of public testimony. 
The task force cannot write legislation but may present recommendations. 
 Lawmakers question Idaho judges about mediation, attorneys fees   

The task force members heard from former Bonneville County magistrate judge Michelle Mallard, who retired and practiced family law before becoming a Bonneville County commissioner, as well as Bear Lake County Magistrate Judge Todd Garbett.

Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, questioned Mallard about her use of mediation, a process for parents to develop a custody and parenting plan without going to trial. 
“That’s something that we are trying to also understand, because that’s not something that everyone is using,” Ehardt said, “and we feel like it’s a tool that maybe can help both with time and with cost.” 
Ehardt asked if judges could step in if it became clear one party in mediation was not working in good faith. 
Under the rules, mediators cannot tell the judges what is going on in mediation, Mallard responded. But if the mediation fails and the two people go to trial, the judge would be able to tell if one person wasn’t cooperating fully, she said. 
Mallard said few of these cases go to trial, but many of the ones that do are very high conflict. She said family case outcomes are “almost entirely by the motivation of their clients.” “I knew people who profess to want a quick resolution, and after a year of negotiation, it became clear to me they really only wanted revenge,” she said. 
The use of mediation is widespread among courtrooms, Mallard said, but not required. 
If a case does go to trial, a lot of parents represent themselves because the cost of attorneys is high and sometimes the availability of family lawyers is low, Mallard said. When she was a judge, she would utilize an informal trial process, which follows a different set of rules and doesn’t use the traditional question-and-answer model. 
Garbett, the Bear County judge, said about 5% of all Idaho child custody cases go to a trial and are decided by a judge.

Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, and Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, both of whom are attorneys, repeatedly asked about awarding attorneys fees to the parent who has less money or less access to legal resources; the Democrats suggested that perhaps the law could be re-written to strengthen a judge’s ability to do so. 
Mallard said that can be done, but awarding attorneys fees happens at the end and can be a “legal quagmire.” 
“The real problem is when you’ve got that imbalance, and you’ve also got this very Ignatius bully who doesn’t care if they spend every last ounce of everyone’s resources to fight this,” Mallard said. “So you can have both a financial imbalance and an emotional imbalance, where some people, even if they have enough money, one party is just not going to fight and the other is.” 
 Judge doesn’t see way to ‘legislate our way’ out of fixing child custody disputes

Committee co-Chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said she kept getting comments from the public about parental rights being taken from one parent and given to the other and asked if that was happening in these trials. 
Garbett specified that termination of parental rights under the law is a rare and specific process, which can be directly and expeditiously appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. 
“I suspect the way more people are using that is I’ve lost some of my time with the child, or ability to make decisions for the child, and maybe that translates into them,” Garbett said. 
“Using those words, ‘my rights have been taken,’ and those will be a case by case analysis, but I can assure you that as far as actual termination of parental rights, very rare.” 
Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, asked Garbett for suggestions as to how the Legislature could tighten up the code to get fewer complaints regarding decisions and to ensure the wellbeing of the children involved in the decisions. 
“There is no way that I can think of that we could legislate our way into not hearing these kinds of stories,” Garbett said. “The problem that we have, is the most difficult case is when you have two parents that sincerely want to spend as much time as possible with their child or children, and they’re earnest and they’re honest.” 
He said there’s few decisions that parents are satisfied with in those cases because their time with their children is limited. 
“Imagine only 18 Christmases with a child, and then, if it’s a contested case, you might get half, you’re going to miss out on half of those Christmases,” Garbett said. “That’s a terrible thing for a parent to have to go through. Yet that’s what magistrate judges are required to do when parents aren’t going to live together anymore or never have lived together in those maternity cases.”

 Public members present hours of grievances against judicial decisions in custody and domestic cases 

Thursday’s meeting included about three hours of personal testimony regarding problems people have faced in domestic and child custody cases. 
The testimony often was emotional, detailing experiences such as those of parents with less money to fight for their children’s custody, other frustrated parents who didn’t feel their judge considered the evidence they presented, and fathers who feel the system automatically favors mothers. 
One father said that in his case, he initially had 50/50 custody with his ex wife, but upon his remarriage and “typical adolescent changes” as his child turned 12 and 13, his custody plan was reduced. 
He suggested that Idaho adopt a standard 50/50 parenting plan, with room for changes on a case-by-case basis. 
“Critics argue that 50/50 isn’t always feasible,” he said. “That’s true, but a default standard doesn’t mean one-size-fits-all, it simply means we start from equal footing and adjust when necessary. In my case, no evidence was presented to justify reducing my time. A default standard would have preserved our original agreement and prevented years of emotional strain on my child and our family.” 
Danielle Hendricks, a sergeant detective in the Williston Police Department in North Dakota, spoke to a case she investigated of a father who had been accused of child abuse by his ex-wife and who was later killed in a Lewiston Rosauers parking lot as he was trying visit his children. 
John Mast was shot and killed in 2021 by his ex-father-law, who this month, alongside Mast’s ex-wife, was found criminally liable for Mast’s death, KLEW reported. 
Mast lived in North Dakota at the time, and Hendricks investigated the allegations of abuse against him. Mast was found clear of any wrongdoing, the detective said. 
“I share this story not just to recount a singular tragedy, but to underscore the critical importance of recognizing the devastating impact that false reports can have,” she said. “As a dedicated Child Protection advocate, I believe we must take every allegation seriously, and any person who abuses a child should be held to the highest penalty. But with that being said, we must also ensure that our systems are not misused in any way that leads to irreversible harm to families of children.” 
Multiple testifiers expressed support for requiring child abuse and domestic violence experts to be consulted during cases that involve allegations of those crimes. One woman said the judge in her case was not trained in noticing the signs of domestic violence, including coercive control. 
Other suggestions included judicial oversight such as an ombudsman to investigate wrongdoing in a case and making it more difficult for custody or non-supervised visitation to be awarded to a parent who is a convicted sex offender. 
The task force is scheduled to meet again Sept. 30 in Nampa.

,DC,2025-09-02 10:10:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Every fall there’s a government shutdown warning. This time it could happen.,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/every-fall-theres-government-shutdown-warning-time-it-could-happen,,"WASHINGTON — Congress returns to Washington, D.C., this week following an uneventful August recess where little to no progress was made on government funding, even though lawmakers have just weeks left until their shutdown deadline.Republican leaders will need the support of several Democratic senators to approve a stopgap spending bill before Oct. 1, since lawmakers have once again failed to complete the dozen full-year bills on time. But what was once a routine bipartisan exercise has taken on heightened stakes, with Democrats and some Republicans increasingly frustrated by the Trump administration’s unilateral spending decisions.The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has issued several reports faulting the Trump administration for impounding, or refusing to spend funds approved by Congress, in violation of the law. And dozens of lawsuits have been filed, alleging the administration has acted to supersede Congress’ power of the purse. The ongoing tension, combined with party leaders’ increasing focus on next year’s midterm elections, makes the possibility of a shutdown higher than it has been for years. President Donald Trump said in mid-August he was open to meeting with Democratic leaders once they were back in town to negotiate a government funding deal but minimized the importance of talks. “Well, I will, I guess, but it’s almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything,” Trump said.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a letter last week urging Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to quickly begin negotiating a bipartisan stopgap bill. “The government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way,” they wrote. “That is the only viable path forward.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said last week that she wants to keep advancing the full-year spending bills, but that a short-term stopgap would be necessary to give lawmakers enough time. “We need to avoid a government shutdown, which would be horrendous if that were to occur on October 1,” Collins said, according to remarks provided by her office. “And we also need to avoid having a continuing resolution, by that I mean a stopgap bill that just puts government on automatic pilot for the whole year. “We're going to have to have a short-term continuing resolution, but we're making really good progress with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I hope that will continue.”Another failureCongress is supposed to complete work on the dozen annual appropriations bills before the start of the new fiscal year but has failed to do so for decades. This year is no different. The House and Senate are nowhere near finishing their work on the bills, which provide funding for dozens of departments, including Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Veterans Affairs.The bills, which make up about one-third of federal spending, also fund smaller agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Science Foundation and the National Weather Service.The House has approved two of the dozen bills — Defense and Military Construction-VA. The Senate has passed its Agriculture, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-VA bills.The House bills have only been supported by GOP lawmakers, while the Senate’s bills are broadly bipartisan, giving that chamber an upper hand if the two chambers begin conferencing full-year bills later this year. Without a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on how much to spend on all of the bills, it’s highly unlikely Congress will be able to complete its work before the Oct. 1 deadline.

Leaders will instead need to reach agreement on a stopgap spending bill that essentially keeps government funding on autopilot until lawmakers can work out a final deal on the full-year bills. The calendar doesn’t give Speaker Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Thune, R-S.D., much time to find compromise with their Democratic counterparts. Both chambers are in session for three weeks at the beginning of September before breaking for Rosh Hashanah. They’ll return to Capitol Hill on Sept. 29 with less than two days to fund the government or begin a partial shutdown.Thune said in mid-August at the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce Inside Washington luncheon that he expects lawmakers will “have a big fight at the end of September.”Last shutdown stretched 35 daysIt’s been almost seven years since some federal departments and agencies had to navigate a shutdown, when Congress and the first Trump administration were unable to broker a funding deal before a deadline.A shutdown this year would have substantially more impact than that 35-day debacle since, when that funding lapse began, Congress had approved the Defense, Energy-Water, Labor-HHS-Education, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-VA spending bills.The departments and agencies funded by those laws, including Congress, weren’t affected by the shutdown.Lawmakers have failed to send any of the full-year bills to Trump so far this year, so every department and agency would need to implement a shutdown plan if Congress doesn't approve a stopgap spending bill before Oct. 1.Federal employees who deal with the preservation of life and property as well as national security will likely be deemed exempt and work without pay until the shutdown ends.Workers who are not considered essential to the federal government’s operations would be furloughed until Congress and the president broker some sort of funding deal.Both categories of employees receive back pay once the lapse ends, though that doesn’t extend to federal contractors.On to the stopgapCongress regularly approves a stopgap spending bill in September to gain more time to complete negotiations on the full-year appropriations bills.That continuing resolution, as it’s sometimes called, usually lasts until the last Friday in December when both chambers of Congress are scheduled to be in Washington, D.C.So a September stopgap would likely last until Friday, Dec. 19, assuming the House and Senate can reach an agreement and hold floor votes in the weeks ahead.Last year, in the lead-up to the presidential election, lawmakers approved a stopgap bill in September that funded the government through mid-December.Following the Republican sweep of the November elections, GOP leaders opted not to negotiate the full-year bills and used a second stopgap bill to fund the government until March after a raucous 48 hours on Capitol Hill.Speaker Johnson took a go-it-alone approach on a third stopgap spending bill, leaving Democrats completely out of the negotiations and jamming the Senate with the legislation.Schumer and several Democrats ultimately helped Republicans get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster, but most voted against actually passing the stopgap.The dilemma over forcing a shutdown or helping Republicans pass a stopgap bill will resurface for Schumer in the weeks ahead as he tries to navigate another shutdown deadline amid unified GOP control of Washington.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-02 06:57:05.136304

(Courtesy of Boise Pride)This weekend, the Boise Pride Festival will start with some change.
Instead of being in the heart of downtown at Cecil D. Andrus Park, the festivities will be held at Ann Morrison Park — to accommodate the growing crowds that turn out each year. 
As fewer companies sponsored the event, organizers shifted to community fundraising but are still planning a scaled-back fireworks show.
And this year’s theme, “Our Pride, Our Power,” is meant to speak to the cultural and political moment.
These anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2025 Idaho legislative session. Where does each stand?

“The legislation that’s occurred in the last year and a half in Idaho has really kind of set people into a more activist mindset, from my personal observation,” Boise Pride Marketing Director Davis Hilton said. “And I think it comes out through that theme. Like we’re still proud of who we are. We’re also very powerful as a community.”
But even with the changes, they say people can still expect the typical Boise Pride experience: A weekend of LGBTQ+ pride festivities, performances, a parade and a fireworks show.
Organizers began hosting Boise Pride in September, rather than during pride month in June, after the COVID pandemic.
This year’s Boise Pride, the 36th annual event, is presented by Albertsons. 
 Boise Pride fundraising for fireworks show amid national decline in corporate sponsorships

As corporate sponsorships dropped this year, Boise Pride is roughly $190,000 short of last year’s sponsorship funds, with $250,000 compared to last year’s $440,000, Hilton told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
That didn’t just happen in Idaho, and is a sign of the times, they said. This year, companies across the U.S. ended sponsorships of LGBTQ+ pride events, Axios reported. 
“The openness of the people and the attendance growing signifies there is a lot of public support for our mission. I just think that on the corporate end, there was a disconnect politically this year,” Hilton said.
As a result of less corporate sponsorships, they said Boise Pride scaled down festivities and raised more from local businesses after announcing the drop off. But Boise Pride is still planning its annual fireworks show Saturday night, with the help of community fundraising.
The Bose Pride fireworks fundraiser — which is accepting donations online — is half way toward its $15,000 goal.

 Before Boise Pride Parade, faith groups will lead blessings

At 9 a.m. Sunday, before the Boise Pride parade starts, faith groups will gather in Ann Morrison Park for the third annual Multifaith Pride Worship Service.
At the service’s end, organizers will offer a blessing over the festival and LGBTQ+ people.
Faith drives Idaho legislator to reverse same-sex marriage. These faith leaders push back.

“Unfortunately, many faith communities have often offered curses and cursed the LGBTQ community  because of their religious beliefs. And so we just want to continue to remind people that we have a counter-message and a counter-narrative, and that particularly fundamentalists religious groups do not get to have the only word or only say on what is moral and what is blessable,” said the Rev. Josh Lee, pastor for the Boise First United Church of Christ. 
At the interfaith event, leaders will ask people to write hurtful memories or the names of people who said hurtful things about them onto a piece of dissolvable paper — which they can put into a water basin on an altar to dissolve after. Another ritual planned invites attendees to honor allies, by writing the names of people who cared for and loved them on a large cloth. 
The event will also feature a book reading performed by the former West Ada School District teacher Sarah Inama. The story of a banner in her classroom promoting inclusivity went viral after she refused to remove it upon a request from the school district, Idaho Education News reported.
 What’s on Boise Pride’s schedule? 

Instead of the usual three days of full events, Boise Pride is planned for Saturday and Sunday. 
There are two paid ticketed events at Treefort Music Hall in downtown Boise this year:

8 p.m. Friday: the Boise Pride Launch Party, featuring live performances from artists The Knocks and Dragonette, drag queen Aquaria and local performers.
9 p.m. ATTENTION, a party featuring live DJing by Shea Couleé, performances from local drag and dance performers and Plane Jane, who appeared in RuPaul’s Drag Race.

Boise Pride is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 6-7, at Ann Morrison Park. The full schedule is available online at boisepridefest.org/festival-schedule.
Here’s a brief rundown:
Saturday: 

The festival runs from 11 a.m. to 9:15 p.m.
Performances start at noon with the Starbelly School of Dance, ending with queer pop artist Zolita starting at 8:15 p.m.
The fireworks show caps the day at 9 p.m. 

Sunday:

At 10 a.m., the Boise Pride Parade starts. But since the festival has moved from the heart of downtown, so has the parade route. The parade now starts at the intersection by South 13th Street and River Street, before running through River Street, crossing the Boise River on Ninth Street and ending along Sherwood Street by Ann Morrison Park. Find the parade route online at boisepridefest.org/pride-parade.
Then the festival opens starting at 11 a.m., with performances throughout the day until the festival ends at 5 p.m.

(Photo: Courtesy Altitude Water)A company looking to make clean drinking water more climate-resilient and accessible during disasters found an ideal testing ground in an unlikely place: Amy Grant’s Williamson County farm.
Florida-based Altitude Water began working with the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter in 2014, when she needed a drinking water source to support a youth summer camp on the rural property in a short time frame.
Grant already had one of the company’s smaller machines, which use technology to pull water from the humid atmosphere. In a matter of weeks, Altitude Water installed a large machine capable of producing more than 100 gallons of drinking water each day, enough to have a gallon of water on hand for each camp attendee.
“We got it done,” Altitude Water Founder and COO Jeff Szur said. “Then from that, as the farm kept growing, we needed more water. She allowed us to use the farm to do some research and development.”
Eleven years later, Grant’s Hidden Trace Farm is now fully water independent — generating, purifying and storing up to 800 gallons of water each day with no reliance on city infrastructure, Szur said.

The system is an unassuming cluster of machines and storage tanks tucked under a covered patio. An atmospheric water generator uses evaporation and condensation to turn humidity from the air into water. An ozone generator runs an electrical charge through the air to create ozone gas. That ozone is then used to purify rainwater and water from the sulfur-laden aquifer below ground. Using ozone to purify water is also a time-tested idea first developed in the 1890s in Europe.
Weather at Altitude Water’s South Florida headquarters is often hot and humid, ideal conditions for the atmospheric water generators to produce high water yields. But other areas of the country — and the world — experience greater range. The company needed to test the machines’ limits in cooler, dryer conditions.
“Testing at Amy Grant’s farm gave us the cooler temperatures and conditions we needed to develop the water and purification systems we are now using in disaster zones and rural communities,” Szur said.
Altitude Water’s smallest machine, which is about the size of a 5-gallon water cooler and sells for around $4,000, can produce up to 15 gallons of water each day. The machine will produce about six gallons of water in 74-degree weather with 45% humidity, he said. That drops to three and a half gallons at 35% humidity.
“We can only take the water out that’s in the air,” Szur said. 
Grant’s farm uses a machine that can produce around 185 gallons of water in 24 hours.
While other companies make machines that similarly use evaporation and condensation to produce water from the air – a natural process that Szur says no one can patent – Altitude Water does hold a patent for their ozone injection system.
The “water hub” system first tested at Hidden Trace can now be seen around the world, providing water to off-grid Maka, Cameroon, and helping survivors in Asheville, North Carolina in the months after Hurricane Helene.
“As communities across the U.S. face ground contamination, aging infrastructure, and climate-driven water emergencies, the work we’ve achieved at Hidden Trace Farm has given us a replicable path forward,” Szur said.
Water, power and cell service on wheels
Altitude Water’s Disaster Relief Trailer got one of its first field tests after wildfires scorched Maui in 2023. It was equipped with a machine that could capture up to 390 gallons of water from the air per day, and a 500-gallon storage tank. There was no time to set the trailer up for solar power, Szur said, so it ran off of a diesel generator.
The company’s second trailer — this time, with a solar power option — was put to the test in Asheville after Hurricane Helene. Altitude Water partnered with Grassroots Aid Partnership and Footprint Project, a nonprofit that provides solar power for communities facing crisis, for disaster response efforts. 
The trailer was equipped with machines able to produce 210 gallons of water and purify 1,500 gallons. Solar panels could generate 12 kilowatts an hour and with 60 kilowatts of battery storage that allowed the water purification machine to run at night. The company also installed Starlink satellite technology, providing phone and internet service. 
“It’s basically a command center with everything you need, without having to ship everything in every day,” Szur said. “You don’t have to ship in gas, you don’t have to ship in bottled water, and then you have your communications, which we added because we saw in Maui — with all the towers burned — how bad the logistics were.”
The trailer is compatible with a gas generator and municipal hookups as well, “because you never know when you get into a disaster what the situation is going to be.”
Dave Anderson, executive director of Grassroots Aid Partnership, recounted his organization’s initial recovery efforts in Asheville in a November video posted to social media. Upon setting up their food operation, they discovered there was no water, power, internet or phone service.
“We forget how reliant we are on these things, so when Altitude came in with this trailer, Bamo! We had water, we had internet, and we had power, so that was a great thing to just start off with,” Anderson said.
Flexibility proved helpful in Asheville, where the trailer stayed for a little over three months, Szur said. The weather became cold and dry, significantly reducing the amount of water that could be pulled from the air.
But the trailer’s water purification capabilities and solar power remained useful, he said.
“Being able to purify the water using our ozone purification process was a godsend, and again, it was being able to do the research and development on Amy’s farm that enabled us to do that,” Szur said.
Szur, who studied economics and business at Vanderbilt University, said he and his father entered the water business together after selling their respective restaurant and oil well businesses. 
“We looked at a lot of the industries and thought that water was going to be the next oil,” Szur said. “We’ve spent centuries using water as our dumping ground to all these chemicals and just trying to dilute the chemicals down to a level that’s safe to drink.”
But it’s not just about technology that provides clean water, he said.
“It can not only help people by giving them a resource, but also give them hope,” Szur said.

In a town best known for snow and its mountain backdrops, Joe Waneka has what might seem an odd problem to solve. As director of operations for the Aspen School District, he is tasked, in part, with keeping the 1,600 students enrolled in the district’s elementary, middle and high schools cool enough so that heat does not preclude learning.
That has become more of an issue on the 32-acre campus set amid the rolling terrain where Maroon Creek hurries toward the valley floor. Part of the reason is Colorado’s mid-August return to schools. Summers have been warming, too. And then there is the smoke from wildfires.
Since students returned to classes, temperatures on the hottest days have reached 78 degrees inside the buildings. “That is their tipping point, if you will, when they start thinking more about getting comfortable than teaching or learning,” he said. “By 80 degrees, you are overwhelmed.”

Open the windows at night and let in some fresh mountain air? It helps until past noon. It does not help at all if wildfires have made the air unhealthy. On Aug. 14, the second day of school this year, the district announced it was making KN95 masks available to all who wanted them after nearby wildfires turned local skies hazy. 
The middle school has central air conditioning. The elementary and high schools have 68 portable air-conditioning wall units, all of them noisy and cumbersome. Waneka describes them as Band-Aids. A better solution is needed.
In November, Waneka began investigating potential remedies. Conventional chiller units could be added but would add an extra $100,000 to $125,000 per building in electricity costs. 
By March, Waneka had narrowed his focus to geothermal, to tap the underground for both coolness and heat. This would comport with the school district’s strategic plan, which calls for students and staff to have access to “sustainable energy.” 
Burning natural gas at the three schools and two associated buildings and the use of snowmelt systems produce 235,000 therms of energy heat annually, according to a report by The GreyEdge Group, a Utah-based consultant that specializes in geothermal energy networks. Greenhouse gas emissions produced are comparable to burning almost seven railcars of coal, according to an Environmental Protection Agency calculator.
Two grants have assisted the school district in exploring the feasibility of creating a well field and retrofitting the buildings. In June, the Colorado Energy Office announced a grant of $78,400, one of five dozen geothermal grants distributed across Colorado in a $12 million program approved by state legislators in 2023. More recently, the Community Office for Resource Efficiency awarded the district a $50,000 grant.
Even before receiving the grants, the school district hired The GreyEdge Group to evaluate a geothermal ambient temperature loop. The report delivered by the company in June estimated that a loop system could reduce annual heating-related emissions 92%.

A test bore may yet be drilled this fall. The drilling would take three days. Cost is estimated at roughly $75,000. Three potential locations on the campus have been established. Test bores — a requirement of the state grant — provide information about soil composition and underground thermal characteristics. This informs decisions about design of the full well field. Scores of closely spaced wells would probably be needed.
If successful, this thermal energy network would provide heat and cooling for up to 600,000 square feet. That includes the schools and other buildings, along with 30,000 square feet of future buildings and 157,000 square feet of athletic fields and the track. 
This technology has been deployed with great success elsewhere in Colorado and other states, and many more systems are planned.
Three miles from the schools, two test bores have already been drilled for what is being called Aspen Airport Business Center Thermal Energy Network. Aided by a $250,000 grant from the Colorado Energy Office, Pitkin County is exploring how to integrate a microgrid with a heating district to reduce energy loads at the airport as well as the Pitkin County Public Works and Roaring Fork Transportation Authority facilities.
At his office in the basement of Aspen High School, Waneka said he was not content to go with easier off-the-shelf solutions to the cooling needs at the schools. Exploring options might produce a truly sustainable energy system and reduce fuel costs. “To me, it is foolish not to explore,” he said.
A mature technology
Geothermal systems exploit the relatively constant temperatures found underground. Geo-exchange, one of several geothermal technologies, uses electric pumps to extract that heat or coolness as needed in the buildings. The process is similar to that used by refrigerators.
Many schools across Colorado already use geo-exchange technology, as does the governor’s mansion in Denver and the state Capitol.
The Poudre School District first used geo-exchange in 2002 at an operations building in Fort Collins. It used the same technology in a school in 2004 and again recently at three new schools in Loveland, in Timnath and in Wellington.
Grand Junction has Colorado’s most prominent use of geothermal. Officials at Colorado Mesa University in 2008 pulled the trigger on a geo-exchange system that now provides heating and cooling for 1.2 million square feet of space contained within 16 campus buildings. The success has drawn national attention. 
University officials say the geo-exchange pipes under soccer fields and other open spaces on the campus coupled with other cost-savings measures and efficiencies enable them to save $1.5 million annually in utility costs. This, they say, allows Colorado Mesa to charge the third-lowest combined tuition and fee rate among Colorado’s 12 public colleges and universities.

A thermal energy network connects multiple buildings through a common geo-exchange system. Pagosa Springs has had such a system for 33 customers in its downtown buildings since 1982. Of course, it has hot springs nearby. 
No need for hot springs, though. Ground temperatures everywhere rise the lower you go. In Colorado, wells for geo-exchange most commonly are sunk 300 to 500 feet.
Standard geo-exchange systems rely solely on pushing heat into and pulling heat from Earth as needed. The energy between the ground and the surface is transferred via recycling water. 
At the campus, something more complex than a simple push-and-pull of underground energy from the underground is being investigated. Aspen’s climate is part of the story. 
Winters in Aspen, at 8,000 feet, last longer and more heat is commonly needed than in Denver or Grand Junction. Given these longer winters and greater heating needs, might a potential thermal energy network on the Aspen schools campus also draw energy from other sources in the area?
For example, can exhaust heat produced in making ice at the nearby Aspen Recreation Center be sequestered in the geothermal well field? Similarly, a sewer pipeline runs relatively proximate to the schools campus. Might the heat be extracted for use in the campus network? GreyEdge examined various alternatives in its June report.
These ideas are not novel. For example, in Denver, heat is drawn from a 72-inch pipeline that transports sewage from downtown to a treatment plant. The extracted heat provides 90% of what is needed for buildings on the 250-acre campus of the National Western Complex, site of the annual stock show.
In Vail, the town government has been working on a smaller-scale application of the same concept, using heat from sewage to melt snow at Lionshead Village, which sits at the base of Vail Mountain.
Holy Cross Energy, the electrical provider for Vail and parts of Aspen, including the schools campus, hopes to see thermal energy networks succeed. It expects to deliver 80% emissions free electricity in 2025. For 2030, it has a goal of 100%. To achieve that ambitious goal, it needs to figure out ways to lower peak demand and improve overall efficiency. The utility sees geothermal energy networks as part of that strategy.
“At times of oversupply, the excess electricity would power a boiler or a chiller, raising or lowering the water temperature in the thermal loop,” Holy Cross Energy CEO Bryan Hannegan wrote in an email.
“This reduces the need for electricity use later by the building’s heat pump,” Hannegan added. “The net effect is to consume excess electricity, store it, and then use it to reduce future electricity demand — basically a thermal version of battery storage. This helps us match our electricity demand to our electricity supply in a more cost-effective way.”
Lauren Suhrbier, who is with Carbondale-based Clean Energy Economy for the Region, describes the work at the schools campus as being in an early stage of investigation. CLEER, which has been developing expertise in geothermal since 2023, has taken on the role of project manager for the Aspen schools’ geothermal exploration and has been paid $10,000 by the school district as of mid-August.
Suhrbier said the district hopes the geo-exchange network can be accomplished for less than $20 million. One possibility is to transfer the risk to an outside financier through an energy performance contract. There is a high probability that this could be part of a future bond election, said Waneka.

A bigger, deeper idea
Another idea involving the campus has even more ambition. This idea — presented to the school district by GreyEdge — would be to drill deep to create a reservoir of energy thousands of feet below the surface and under an impervious layer of rock. Energy in the form of pressure could be stored and then tapped to produce electricity.
Long-duration storage will be crucial for the decarbonization of electricity by all electrical utilities. Existing battery technologies come up short. Pumped-storage hydro, an old technology, has been used near Georgetown and in reservoirs near Leadville for decades. Water from a higher reservoir is released as needed to produce electricity then pumped back to the upper reservoir when electricity is plentiful. Several more such pumped-storage ideas are being pursued along the Yampa River west of Steamboat Springs.
GreyEdge has partnered with two other companies — Pure-Green Colorado and Sage Geosystems — to propose a 8,000- to 10,000-foot well at the Aspen campus. Excess renewable energy could be stored in that underground reservoir.
This reservoir might be compared to a balloon. The rock at that depth would be fractured to create a place where energy can be stored under pressure. Just as air is exhaled into a balloon and then released, energy could be stored in this underground balloon then released to generate electricity.
GreyEdge estimates a potential capacity for 5 megawatts of generation. That’s about the same capacity as the 35-acre solar farm that opened in 2021 near Woody Creek. The difference is that the solar farm produces electricity only when the sun is shining. The underground reservoir would produce electricity at crucial times as well as provide heat as needed for the school district campus.
Drilling deep holes is a surmountable challenge, as oil and gas drillers in the Piceance Basin, north of Rifle, have routinely drilled wells 8,000 to 10,000 feet deep. 
But does a geologic lid exist to prevent energy from escaping that “balloon”? GreyEdge has assembled geological reports that suggest that such a lid exists in the area of the Aspen campus. 
GreyEdge believes that this idea of underground storage has been deployed only in Iceland.
The idea was delivered to the Aspen School District, but no formal discussion has been held nor commitments made. It is, at this point, just an idea.
Cost matters
Cost matters everywhere. In new buildings, the greater cost of geothermal as compared to conventional heating and cooling is negligible, according to study for a new public building in Fort Collins.
Retrofitting buildings, however, always costs more. The question is how much in utility bills projects recoup and how quickly. In Fort Collins, utility costs for that first school building with geothermal declined 50% in the first decade. However, Aaron Tilden, of Millig Design Build, said that retrofits commonly need grants to pencil out in less than a 20- to 25-year time frame.
Grants were crucial to the decision by school board members at Liberty School District J-4, which has 78 students and is located amid farms and ranches 130 miles east of Denver. The school board members were aware that the geo-exchange system would reduce emissions, but that was not the motivation.
In Fort Collins, though, Poudre School District has energy goals of being good community stewards and protective of natural resources while being fiscally prudent. “The two go hand in hand,” Trudy Trimbath, the district’s energy and sustainability manager, said of the geo-exchange systems.
Eagle County needed to replace a natural gas system but also has a goal of setting an example with its $14.5 million geo-exchange system now being installed at the county courthouse campus in Eagle. The network of 66 wells will provide heat and cooling for 75,657 square feet for three buildings beginning in October. 
County officials say they can justify the expense not only in cost savings over time but in the external costs. Eagle County Commissioner Matt Scherr said the existing natural-gas-burning system needed to be replaced but part of the calculation was recognition of the need to reduce greenhouse gases.
As for the Aspen School District, results of the test bore will inform whether any ideas around geothermal become a formal proposal. If the results are favorable, it’s possible that a project could get underway in 2027.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.











We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics



Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Photo: Getty Images)n April 2024, I urged TennCare and the Tennessee Legislature to take obesity seriously. TennCare’s recent commitment to expanding coverage for obesity medications isn’t just a policy update: it is a lifeline for thousands of Tennesseans and a rare opportunity for our state to lead the nation in treating one of its most urgent health crises. 
I’ve struggled with obesity my entire life. I know the health challenges it brings, the stigma that comes with weight, the unsolicited comments from strangers, the scoldings from doctors who dismiss the complexity of this disease with “eat less and walk more” and the gimmick solutions advertised on TV. I’ve fought for my own care for as long as I can remember.  
As a past chair of the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) and proud Tennessean, I’ve spent more than a decade working alongside advocates, clinicians, and policymakers to recognize obesity as a chronic disease and change the way it is covered by insurance. This decision is a victory for Tennesseans living with obesity.  
Obesity affects more than 40% of adults in the U.S., yet far too often, treatment access depends on where you live or what insurance you have. At a time when several states are moving to cut their state’s coverage or have chosen to cut back Medicaid coverage for obesity care, Tennessee is expanding this critical coverage for obesity medications. There is overwhelming evidence that comprehensive treatment of obesity improves health outcomes and reduces long-term health care costs. Now, more people affected by the disease can access medications along with nutritional counseling, behavioral therapy, and surgery.
Tennessee Legislature can aid state’s obesity problem

By expanding access to FDA-approved obesity medications for Medicaid enrollees, TennCare’s actions clearly signal that we believe people living with obesity deserve evidence-based care, not judgment or denial. Obesity is a disease, one that deserves treatment – just like diabetes, heart disease or cancer. 
This is more than a win for Tennesseans; it’s a demonstration that state-level action can drive change even when federal policy progress is stagnant. Other states should examine Tennessee’s decision closely and ask: Why not us? To improve public health, reduce chronic disease, and create a more equitable healthcare system, expanding access to obesity care must be part of the solution.
Coverage decisions like this also help dismantle the stigma surrounding obesity and send the message that we know obesity is more than willpower, but a complex interplay of biology, environment, and genetics.
This change didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of persistent advocacy from people living with obesity, healthcare providers, and nonprofit organizations like OAC. 
TennCare’s action is a victory for patients and for the idea that every person deserves access to the care they need, and it should be just the beginning.

All but one person in attendance shared concerns about the proposed project. (Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)WHARNCLIFFE, W.Va. — When Sheila Miller sat down at a picnic table at Wharncliffe Park last Thursday, she was armed with a notebook, a pen and numerous questions.
She wanted to know what the environmental and health ramifications would be for two off-grid methane power plants, a data center and an ammonia plant that are proposed to be constructed at the old Twisted Gun Golf Course a few miles from her home.
“I don’t know much about this at all and that worries me,” Miller said. “I like my peace and quiet and now I’m hearing this could really change things. I would have liked to be more informed by the government or the company or whoever else should have informed us so I could know what those changes would be.”
The proposed development — called the Adams Fork Energy project — comes from TransGas and would create the largest natural gas-fueled ammonia plant in the world. The two power plants onsite — which would operate as “microgrids” — would power two new data centers: one at the golf course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park.
Currently, the state Department of Environmental Protection is reviewing air quality permit applications from TransGas for the development of the two off-grid power plants. The permit to construct the ammonia plant is already in place.
On Thursday, Miller was one of about 50 residents from Mingo and Logan counties who attended an unofficial community meeting to learn more about the proposed projects. Tyler Cannon, the Climate Alliance Coordinator with West Virginia Citizen Action Group, led the meeting, which was casual and mostly based on group discussion as well as questions and answers.
Cannon, a Logan County native, answered what he could. But several of the residents’ most pressing concerns couldn’t be addressed because of redactions made in the air quality permit applications filed with the DEP.
“It’s possible there are some things in there that could help us understand more about how [these facilities] will be built and what their actual environmental impact will be, but if that does exist, it’s redacted,” Cannon told community members. “They are saying these are proprietary secrets, meaning we the public aren’t allowed to know.”
The redactions in the air quality permits aren’t unusual. In Tucker County, where a different company is attempting to construct a natural gas power plant to provide electricity for another data center, a heavily redacted air quality permit — now approved by the DEP — has left hundreds of residents with similar concerns.
There, residents only found out about the proposed project — which would be a massive complex when completed — when someone saw a public notice posted in a local newspaper. The community started organizing to find out more information. Despite these efforts and an outpour of public comments against the development, they couldn’t learn much more and the DEP ended up approving Fundamental Data’s request.
For Miller and other residents who spoke at Thursday’s meeting, the lack of public outreach in the coalfields — as in Tucker County — felt intentional.
“It’s not surprising, I suppose, that they didn’t tell us,” Miller said. “It does feel like it was on purpose. Like they didn’t tell us more so we couldn’t do anything about it. Although it probably wouldn’t matter; [the people in power] are always going to let these corporations walk all over us down here.”
Gilbert resident Pam Surber said she’s spent the last few months talking to people in the community whenever possible about the proposed project. When she goes to the store or stops by the gas station, she brings it up to cashiers or others in line. Rarely, she said, is someone aware of what she’s talking about.
“I can’t tell you how many people have not heard a word about this,” Surber said. “They don’t know what’s about to happen and they don’t know how it could hurt them.”

‘We’ve had enough devastation’
At 79 years old, Miller has lived by Left Fork Bens Creek, in Mingo County, her entire life. Life there has been pleasant, she said. She knows all of her neighbors — she watched several of them grow up — and loves living so close to nature. 
But through her decades living in the region, she’s already seen the environment and landscape around her change drastically. She’s seen and experienced firsthand the consequences that can come from living so close to extractive industries.
“Our health, our environmental health, is already real bad down here,” Miller said. “We’ve had enough devastation from coal mining, from strip mining, from logging, from fracking. Our people are already sick. We don’t see the birds or the animals here like we used to.”
According to the air quality permit applications, the facilities would have the capacity to produce more than 2,400 megawatts each. If approved, the two TransGas facilities would be the third- and fourth-highest power-intensive industrial sites in the state, behind the John Amos Power Plant in Putnam County and the Harrison Power Station in Harrison County.
Each facility would house 117 engines powered by natural gas, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot.
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from emissions.
Residents at Thursday’s meeting were particularly concerned about the impact of air pollution. Already, the state’s southern coalfields suffer from some of the highest rates of black lung disease due to the concentration of coal miners.
During the meeting, Wilma Steele asked those in attendance to raise their hands if they knew someone who was living with black lung. Almost 40 hands immediately rose.
“We all know folks who are already sick, with COPD, with black lung, with cancer,” someone in the crowd said. “Why would we want something that can hurt us even more?”
Cannon said the new power generation is almost certainly going to have negative health and environmental impacts. What’s frustrating, he said, is the inability to know how bad it actually could be because of the lack of information.
TransGas alleges that the facilities will have technology allowing them to sequester more than 99% of the carbon emissions produced. But the permit filed with the DEP doesn’t specify how.
“Technically speaking, that’s impossible,” Cannon said. “No other [facility] anywhere has been able to do that, and because of the redactions we can’t really see how they plan to be different.”
Only one person in attendance on Thursday, Ernie Sammons, spoke in support of the Adams Fork Energy project. He told residents that he is strongly in support of the proposed projects because the area needs more jobs. Other places across the world, he alleged, are already undertaking similar kinds of developments. The environmental concerns, he continued, are largely overblown.
But — as pointed out by residents in the meeting — Sammons stands to personally benefit from the development. He said he owns the land for the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and is the one selling it to TransGas for the development.
“But even if I didn’t stand to benefit financially here,” Sammons said, “I would support this.”
Per TransGas, a majority of the jobs created by the proposed development — about 5,000 — would be in construction, meaning they’d be temporary and would not necessarily be taken by locals. Once up and running, TransGas says 300 people would be hired to work on a “day-to-day basis.”
Surber, however, remains doubtful. Even if jobs were created, she told Sammons, she’s not sure the cost to the environment and residents would be worth the alleged gain.
“Are you comfortable with a child breathing this air? With anyone who is sick, who could become sick?” Surber asked. “All the money, all the jobs in the world are not worth the health of my family, of my neighbors, of my community. We can’t afford that.”

Residents struggle for clean water as TransGas requests access to underground source
Power plants and data centers need a lot of water to function, Cannon said. Some data centers can use up to 5 million gallons of drinking water a day. The consequences of this water usage are becoming clearer as communities across the country that are located next to new data center developments have been tapped dry or had their water contaminated.
Oftentimes, these new developments will tap into municipal water sources. As proposed in Mingo County, however, TransGas plans to tap into mine pools located underneath the golf course.
But while the source of the water is different — Mingo County Public Service District pulls most of its drinking water from the Tug Fork River — residents are frustrated.
Until several years ago, Miller and most of the residents in Wharnscliffe relied on private wells for their drinking water. Miller had two. But, likely due to mining activity in the vicinity, one ran dry and the foundation in the other cracked, leading to contamination underground. Others in the region experienced the same.
“When we have water, I don’t trust what comes out,” Miller said. “You never know what’s in there. Sometimes it has an odor to it. There are breaks and things that happen that we’re not told about. It’s really frustrating, and it’s scary.”
Now hooked up to the Mingo County PSD, water service outages are the norm.
Last winter, Miller said her water was out for days and sometimes weeks at a time. She would drive to a friend’s house in Gilbert to shower, do laundry and more.
Several residents at Thursday’s meeting said they’ve contacted the Mingo County Commission about tapping into the underground mine water to service their community in order to avoid these outages.
They haven’t heard any progress on that front, they said last week.
But now, that water — which will have to be treated to remove minerals and potential contaminants before being used by the data centers and in the power plants, the same process that would be used for drinking water — will be committed to TransGas under its current applications.
Cannon said the company will have “no cap” on the water it is allowed to pull from the mine shafts.
“They can pump as much from these water tables as they want,” Cannon said. “None of that will go to residents.”
This was especially upsetting to community members.
“Everyone, how many of you have had your water destroyed in Mingo County, ever?” Steele asked those in attendance on Thursday.
Every hand under the camping shelter shot up.
“Water failure and access to clean water has been a longstanding issue in Mingo County,” Cannon said. “Now, it’s like they want to hand this potential fresh water resource to this private company to have unlimited access to the water table when residents don’t have access to clean water in their home themselves. How does that serve the people who live here?”
Surber said she’s used to seeing industry exploit the resources and people in West Virginia’s southern coalfields. 
It’s been the norm for the people living there since the coal industry was booming. Every few years since then, political leaders come in claiming to have a new industry or sector that will revive the struggling region.
But that revival has never happened. Logging hasn’t addressed the region’s struggles, nor has manufacturing or fracking or strip mining. Tourism has yet to revive the economy. 
Surber, Steele and numerous other residents present Thursday said they doubt that data centers will be the silver bullet those in charge claim they’ll be for their communities.
“There is nothing that I can see about these data centers that will be good,” Surber said. “The people who want to do this aren’t speaking to us, too much is being kept hush-hush and we don’t know what’s at risk because they won’t tell us. None of this is worth it.”
The DEP has extended the public comment period for TransGas’ two air quality permits until 5 p.m. on Sept. 19. A final in-person public meeting will be held by the DEP between 4:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Sept. 18 at the Harless Center in Gilbert.

(Getty Images)At the urging of Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on mail-in voting threatening an executive order banning the practice. 
The president does not have the constitutional authority to carry out this threat. Elections are under the authority of the states.  
Eliminating mail-in voting in Idaho would disenfranchise many qualified voters, including those living in rural or remote areas who do not have access to in-person voting. Idaho has 11 such precincts that are mail-in voting only. 
Others who rely on this voting service are military personnel and their families as well as those who are traveling, conducting out-of-state religious service, or those caring for others. 
Changing Idaho law, the only way to eliminate mail-in voting, would also impact those without transportation or the flexibility to leave work, and citizens with disabilities. Other voters want to take time with their ballot, studying candidates and the issues. Absentee balloting facilitates more informed voting choices.
With 34 other countries using some form of mail-in voting, the U.S. is not alone.
With over 914K ballots cast, Idaho broke voting records in 2024 general election, initial data show

A Republican president attacking mail-in voting now is reacting to sentiments of his party disavowed in the 2024 general election. In that election, the national Republican Party embraced the practice, pumping $16 million dollars into mail voting promotions targeting low propensity voters. The effort paid big dividends. Republicans outpaced Democrats in mail-in voting in some key states.
 In Pennsylvania alone, GOP voters increased their share of mail-in ballots from 25% in 2020 to 32% in 2024. It is not a coincidence that the 2020 and 2024 elections have had the highest voter turnout since 1908 at 66% and 64% respectively. During these elections, mail voting hit its highest levels with 43% during the pandemic and 30% when it was actively encouraged. 
Eight states including Utah, Oregon and Washington allow all elections conducted by mail. Other states allow some small elections to be conducted by mail-in ballots. 
Idahoans have been able to vote by mail through no-excuse absentee balloting since 1970. Since 2021, this previously uncontroversial provision has seen three attempts by legislators to either eliminate it or restrict it under the pretense of election integrity. Each time they have claimed that absentee balloting was only intended for special cases.
 The intent of the governing statute 34-1001, is clear: “Any registered elector of the state of Idaho may vote in any election by absentee ballot.” Additionally, Idahoans have been told repeatedly by successive secretaries of state that Idaho has free, fair and secure elections. There are multiple layers of security provided for in the absentee balloting process to make sure only those eligible to vote do so.  
Research has shown over time that increasing voting options, including mail-in voting, increases voter turnout. With Idaho at an average of 54% voter turnout in general elections since 1980 and a meager 21% in primary elections when most races are decided, it would bode poorly for Idaho if this option where eliminated or restricted.
Idahoans who are eligible to vote should be encouraged to exercise their constitutional right to vote in all elections. Voting options enable citizens to participate in our democracy and makes us stronger as a state and as a nation. The struggle for voting rights has been ongoing since the founding of this nation. The League of Women Voters advocates for empowering voters. We the people are responsible for protecting mail-in voting.

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Midwest farm economies suffered while some Sun Belt states kept rolling in early 2025

Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.

In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota health officials, health care providers and the public are waiting for details on how the state will implement changes to its Medicaid programs, but federal guidance may not be handed out until 2026.
Without that guidance, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services and health care providers won’t be able to calculate potential administrative costs forced by the changes, or have a clearer picture on how to implement new processes, said Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the state Department of Health and Human Services.
The new requirements will affect about 23,000 of the more than 108,000 Medicaid recipients in the state who are part of the Medicaid expansion program.
Aker said the department knows communicating the changes in the program will be important for patients and providers. 
She said the department is planning a public information campaign, but that needs to wait until detailed guidance on the program is released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Aker added that receiving those specifics before 2026 would be “very optimistic.”
Coverage exemptions, new work requirements and semiannual eligibility check-ins were part of the federal budget reconciliation package signed into law by President Donald Trump in July that will change the Medicaid program.
“We don’t know exactly how the federal government is going to require us to document that exemption,” Aker said. “Until we know more, we don’t want to speculate about exactly what that will look like.”
The state is hopeful the department will be able to use as much existing reporting infrastructure as possible to make submitting documents less burdensome, she said. 
Aker said the department will also try to automate some enrollment processes for efficiency.
Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, said he thinks it is too early to determine how the changes will affect Medicaid coverage or attach a dollar amount to the overall cost of the changes.
Officials predict only 5% of North Dakota Medicaid recipients will be impacted by program changes

He said the association is concerned that when people lose health care coverage they won’t complete annual check-ups or use preventative care services, which could lead to longer-term chronic conditions. 
“If you don’t have coverage, that one person if it’s not detected early, it’s detected later, that becomes chronic and probably the health care cost goes up because of that,” Blasl said.
He added that increased expense could lead to higher costs across the health care system for all patients.
Blasl said the hospital association will be monitoring the new eligibility and work requirements closely because, if people lose coverage, health care providers could also see an increase in charity care cases and patient medical debt.
“If people lose coverage, they are always going to be able to access health care, but those individuals now become uninsured and then who covers the cost of that service?” Blasl said. “Typically, it’s probably going to turn into bad debt.”
Shannon Bacon, director of external affairs for the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas, said rural health care facilities sometimes rely on Medicaid reimbursements to make ends meet.
“Medicaid really helps sustain access to care for other people, too, who maybe aren’t even on Medicaid,” Bacon said. “It makes it possible to sustain a rural health care facility in their community, so that’s something we’re really paying attention to, that sustainability piece.”
One element of the Medicaid program changes that has received a lot of news coverage are the provider tax provisions included the Republican megabill, Aker said.
Provider taxes are a regulated tax arrangement that states can levy on health care organizations, including hospitals and health systems, nursing facilities, and managed care organizations, to pay for their portion of the Medicaid program, according to the American Hospital Association. 
However, Aker said those taxes will not affect North Dakota rural hospitals and clinics in the same way as other states because North Dakota does not use that tax as a major funding source. North Dakota uses one provider tax for intermediate care facilities that raises about $32 million per year for the program, which represents less than 1% of the HHS budget.
“We won’t be able to do any new provider taxes, but we’re not in the position where we need to reduce provider taxes and come up with new state funding,” she said.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

North Dakota will also receive about $100 million per year for the next five years as part of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program that was included in the new law to offset provider tax losses in other states. Aker said applications for those rural hospital grants are due by the end of the year.
“I really feel that this is going to be pretty transformational for our state,” she said. Aker added grants could be awarded for prevention and management of chronic diseases, investments in medical technology, recruiting and retaining workforce in rural areas, access to behavioral health services and right-sizing community health care systems.
Blasl said he believes rural health care facilities may see a fair amount of that extra funding to offset any potential losses due to the program changes.
“The operating margins in the rural areas are a little lower than what they are in the urban areas,” he said. “That’s a concern because if they are in the red already and now we see less people with coverage, they are going to be more in the red and can they survive? But you could say that for an urban hospital as well.”
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, has served on the Senate Human Services Committee since coming into the Legislature in 1995, including serving as chair for the last 24 years. 
Lee said there are always unintended consequences when changes are made to programs, which means it’s important to listen to concerns of the affected groups. 
Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for rural hospitals that were able to remain open because it paid facilities for care that may not have been originally covered, she said.
Lee said North Dakota has 37 critical access hospitals serving rural areas of the state that could be impacted by even small changes.
She also stressed that people should get more information about how the Medicaid program is run in North Dakota before jumping to conclusions.
“You are always scared of things you don’t know,” Lee said. “We need to just not get all bent out of shape until we find out what it really is. And as I’ve learned a tiny bit more … I have fewer apprehensions about it.”

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)LSU is not documenting feedback from student athletes in most of its athletic programs, including football, raising concerns about the university’s compliance with NCAA rules. 
In a public records request, the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag asked for five years of player exit interviews, which all NCAA Division I schools are required to conduct with a sampling of athletes every year at the time they graduate or their eligibility expires. 
The interviews are intended to give athletes an opportunity to provide critical feedback on their school’s sports programs. But for most teams, LSU did not document a single interview during the five-year period. 
LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell said the university is complying with the NCAA’s exit interview bylaw, but the interviews aren’t always documented – which the NCAA does not require. 
The NCAA gives schools immense latitude on how to conduct the interviews and what questions to ask. Its rules don’t require that the questions are asked in person, allowing some schools to provide students with an online form. The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment asking whether there are penalties for institutions that don’t comply or what value the bylaw holds if institutions don’t have to prove compliance. 
For the five-year period, LSU did not document any interviews with the football, men’s basketball, men’s golf, women’s golf, gymnastics or track and field programs. No LSU team had at least one interview documented annually, and most sports went multiple years without having any interviews documented, representing more than 1,000 student athletes who may have had their feedback ignored. 

A review of the 64 athlete interview forms LSU provided in response to the public records requests revealed complaints about facilities and coaches — including multiple allegations of bullying and intimidation by swimming and diving coaches. 
It is rare for exit interviews from a major college athletic program to be released. In 2019, the online news outlet The Intercollegiate submitted public records requests for the interviews from every public NCAA Division I program. Most universities denied the requests, including LSU and almost every other Southeastern Conference institution. The unavailability of these records makes it difficult to compare LSU’s compliance with peer institutions. 



NCAA Bylaw 8.3 
​​The institution’s director of athletics, senior woman administrator or designated representatives (excluding coaching staff members) shall conduct exit interviews in each sport with a sample of student-athletes (as determined by the institution) whose eligibility has expired. Interviews shall include questions regarding the value of the students’ athletics experiences, the extent of the athletics time demands encountered by the student-athletes, proposed changes in intercollegiate athletics and concerns related to the administration of the student-athletes’ specific sports. 



Experts say not documenting student-athletes’ feedback is a disservice to them, and it raises concerns about whether the university is actually conducting the interviews at all. 
Molly Harry, a University of Florida sports management professor whose research has focused on NCAA exit interviews, said it is concerning LSU is not documenting its athletes’ feedback. 
“Athletes are gaining power economically, as we speak, with [revenue sharing] … but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they have the more procedural power in the athletics department,” Harry said. “These exit interviews could potentially lead to changes in the future through that procedure.” 
Greenwell did not respond to follow-up questions about why LSU only documents interviews for certain sports, how many interviews LSU has conducted in each sport or how LSU is able to use information it gathers in the interviews if no notes are taken. 
Harry said not recording interviews for men’s sports could lead to gender inequities, as they tend to have worse academic and social experiences than women athletes. Football and basketball programs also tend to have more taxing travel schedules, and not obtaining feedback from these teams leaves a significant gap in the data, she added. 
“You’re not getting the perspective of the high profile sports who might have found it pretty unmanageable,” Harry said. 
Allison Smith, a professor of sport management at Georgia State University, said allowing universities to self-police is a weakness in many NCAA bylaws. 
“The NCAA needs to uphold what the member institutions are doing regarding their bylaws,” Smith said. 
LSU initially attempted to deny the Illuminator’s public records request when it was made in 2023, arguing exit interviews were exempted from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a federal law that protects students’ personal information. 
With the help of the Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic, the Illuminator and Tiger Rag were able to obtain the 65 interviews that were recorded, though they were released with redactions. On each document, LSU redacted the student’s name as well as their response to questions about team medical and mental health providers.

Student-athlete exit interviews the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag obtained in a public records request to LSU show multiple complaints from swimming and diving athletes over three years. They center on head coach Rick Bishop and former associate head coach Leah Stancil, whose contract was not renewed when it expired earlier this year. 
When asked whether Stancil’s non-renewal was related to the complaints, LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell said the university does not comment on specific personnel matters. Bishop and Stancil did not respond to requests for comment. The swimming and diving team has one set of coaches for both men and women athletes. 
In their interviews, the athletes allege the swimming and diving program was rife with bullying and motivation through fear. One athlete said the program broke them “physically and mentally,” while another said the coaches didn’t respect injuries. 
One student complained that Stancil “made her life hell,” the administrator who conducted the interview wrote, causing her to have a mental health crisis, and that the assistant coach ruined the sport for her. Multiple athletes said in their interviews that Stancil made fun of a Chinese student’s name, commented on athletes’ appearances and showed favoritism toward men on the team.

Other students reported that after a woman on the team complained about inappropriate behavior by male teammates, Bishop excused the men’s behavior in comments to the entire team, saying “boys are stupid and can make stupid decisions” while making direct eye contact with the woman who made the report. The interview records do not detail the nature of the inappropriate behavior. 
One student complained that Bishop intimidated her when she attempted to raise concerns about Stancil’s behavior, alleging the head coach would not let her read a letter detailing Stancil’s actions without Stancil present. 
“[It was] like asking you to report a bully while the bully is in the room with you,” the athlete wrote, adding she believed Bishop protected Stancil instead of her. 
One student said they believed LSU’s athletic department administration was aware of the coaches’ behavior. 
In a letter notifying Stancil her contract would not be renewed, LSU Athletics Director Scott Woodward thanked the coach for her contributions to the university. 
“We appreciate your dedication and wish you the best in future endeavors,” Woodward said in the letter, which the Illuminator and Tiger Rag obtained through a public records request. 
The Illuminator and Tiger Rag asked the university for copies of its student-athlete exit interviews from 2021-25. The NCAA requires all Division I schools to conduct interviews with a sampling of athletes every year once they graduate or after their eligibility expires, but the interviews do not have to be recorded. The process is intended to give athletes an opportunity to share feedback about their school’s sports programs. 
The swimming and diving teams, by far, had the most interviews recorded, with 35 students giving feedback over four years based on the records provided. Although 10 athletes criticized Stancil and Bishop, almost everyone interviewed had some positive comment about their athletics experience, including one person who praised Bishop’s coaching. 
After swimming and diving, the team with the most interviews recorded was the gymnastics team, with six interviews in two years. 
Six of LSU’s 16 athletics teams did not record a single interview over the five-year period. Those that did recorded very few interviews, sometimes going multiple years without any student feedback reported.

States have been reporting steady increases in vaccination exemption requests for kids. (Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Dr. Rana Alissa hears it daily in her practice.
“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.











We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics



Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

The Bureau of Land Management is holding a lease sale Wednesday for land at the Freedom Mine north of Beulah. 
The Coteau Properties Co. has applied to lease approximately 1,070 acres containing an estimated 18.3 million tons of recoverable federal coal. If approved, the lease would allow continued operations at the Freedom Mine through 2045.

North American Coal is pursuing a lease to mine 800 acres of federal land at the Falkirk Mine near Underwood in central North Dakota. The mine feeds the nearby Coal Creek Station power plant. A lease sale is set for Sept. 10.  
A coalition of environmental groups, including North Dakota-based Dakota Research Council, has filed comments opposing Falkirk leases with the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Surfacing Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement — agencies that fall under the Department of the Interior. Fort Berthold POWER (Protectors of Water and Earth Rights) also was included in comments on the Freedom Mine lease. 
The group Earthjustice took the lead on both comment submissions, saying newly implemented leasing procedures by the Department of the Interior are relying on a Trump administration’s energy emergency proclamation that environmental groups argue cut corners in the environmental assessment process. 
President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 declared an energy emergency. It says the United States’ “inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans.” 
Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, said with stable electric and home heating prices, there is no energy emergency. 
“The whole justification for this doesn’t make any sense,” Skokos said. 
David Straley is manager of government and public affairs at North American Coal, which owns the Falkirk Mine and Coteau Properties Co. He said the company is trying to fill its obligation to the Coal Creek power plant as efficiently as possible. The company first applied for the Falkirk lease in 2019.
North American Coal revised its request in 2020 and 2021. Those requests were neither denied nor granted. 
The 800 acres is projected to produce 11 million tons of coal over 15 years.
“North American Coal believes that these natural resources are for the betterment of the United States, for the betterment of our economy, and they help strengthen our electrical grid and our national security,” Straley said. 
In addition to the energy emergency, Trump in April issued an executive order about revitalizing the coal industry, including removing impediments to mining coal on federal land. 
Also this spring, Interior announced it would allow “alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance,” referring to the National Environmental Policy Act. It cited the energy emergency as allowing an expedited process. 
On June 20, the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Surfacing Mining announced a public comment period on the environmental assessment for the Falkirk Mine. The agencies accepted comments from June 23 to July 7. There was a public hearing in Underwood on July 7, but no members of the public attended.

An April 24 hearing on the Freedom Mine in Beulah also had no members of the public in attendance. 
One objection from the environmental coalition is that the Department of the Interior’s alternative process does not allow adequate time for a properly researched environmental assessment or for the public to comment on the assessment. 
“In the past, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Surface Mining would notify people of a public comment period and try to encourage public involvement, but that’s clearly not what happened here,” Shiloh Hernandez, an Earthjustice attorney said.
Skokos said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, is “putting his finger on the scales for fossil fuels.” 
Skokos predicted Trump’s energy emergency will be challenged in court, though it may not be challenged through these leases. 
“Nothing is illegal until a judge rules on it,” Skokos said. 
Acting BLM Director Bill Groffy said in a news release that the Freedom Mine lease sale reflects the Trump administration’s commitment to expanding domestic energy production. “The proposed lease will help maintain operations at one of the nation’s most productive lignite coal mines, supporting local jobs and reinforcing America’s energy security,” Groffy said in the release. 
Straley said without the ability to mine the federal land, the company would “would literally go around” that land and it would be difficult to return to it. 
“You kind of get one bite at the apple,” he said. 
The emergency coal lease application for Freedom Mine says if the coal deposits are not leased, they may be bypassed. If leased, at least some of the coal would be mined within three years. 
Other Earthjustice objections to the mines include pollution from the power plants. 
The comments note that Coal Creek Station is designated by the Environmental Defense Fund as the largest mercury emitting coal plant in the country. 
Earthjustice said that if the agencies regard emissions from the coal plants as an indirect effect of the mining, the emissions must still be included in an analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act.
The Environmental Protection Agency had tightened mercury emissions rules under the Biden administration, which North Dakota regulators had called “a death sentence” for the state’s coal industry. The Trump administration has been rolling back environmental regulations. 
“I would say the (mercury) rule’s on life support right now, and they’re not currently applying it to the Coal Creek Station or any coal plant in North Dakota,” Hernandez said. 
Jessica Bell, vice president of external affairs for Rainbow Energy, which operates Coal Creek Station, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Basin Electric Power Cooperative said in a statement that the cooperative and its subsidiaries have invested more than $2 billion in environmental control technologies. Since the cooperative began monitoring mercury in 2015, it has reduced mercury emissions intensity by nearly 80%, according to the statement.
North Dakota’s Lignite Energy Council deferred comment on the mining applications to the mining companies.

After Trump’s executive order on coal, the group praised the move as did North Dakota’s congressional delegation. 
“President Trump’s leadership sends a clear message: America is done apologizing for using its natural resources,” Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council said in a news release. “Coal is not just an energy source — it’s a strategic asset.”
The industry group says North Dakota has an 800-year supply of lignite coal, and “a proud track record of environmental stewardship.” 
The group says North Dakota has never violated federal ambient air quality standards.
“We mine responsibly, reclaim the land after mining, and provide the most affordable, reliable power in the nation,” Fortner said in the release.

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

The complaint claims the department v[...],"The Nebraska State Capitol. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A developmental disability service provider is suing Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services over a 2024 order the provider claims was unconstitutional.
Integrated Life Choices (ILC) filed a complaint in Lancaster District Court Aug. 25 against DHHS and Developmental Disabilities Director Tony Green. The complaint claims the department violated the constitutional separation of powers by unilaterally mandating providers switch to a new emergency safety intervention program called The Mandt System.

In February 2024, DHHS issued a bulletin requiring providers to exclusively use Mandt for staff training by July 2025. Providers that did not comply faced decertification and a loss of Medicaid funding, according to the complaint.
In a press release from the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is helping represent ILC in the lawsuit, The Mandt System is a for-profit program designed for both children and adults. With ILC’s services being adult-focused, the release argues that The Mandt System is not suited for all Nebraska providers.
Furthermore, the mandate was expensive. The release claims that implementing the new training cost ILC at least $60,000 to cover its 10 trainers, and comes with recurring costs every two years.
ILC attempted to stand its ground and maintain the group’s former training program, which the complaint alleges DHHS approved in 2021. But starting on July 2, DHHS stopped referring new clients to ILC, forcing the provider to comply, according to the complaint.
“In Nebraska’s developmental disabilities system, referrals function like the doctor’s note you need before seeing a specialist — they are the formal authorization that allows a provider to begin serving a new client under the state’s waiver program,” the release explained. “Without them, no new clients can enter ILC’s services, threatening both its financial viability and its ability to serve vulnerable Nebraskans.”
The complaint alleges that the department’s mandate executed legislative power without legislative approval, thus violating powers reserved for the Legislature, not the executive branch. However, multiple lawmakers said they weren’t certain that this authority would normally fall to them.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of DHHS in recent years, said she wasn’t certain the department needed legislative approval to implement this type of program. She said she’s heard that The Mandt System is well-respected but noted that the lawsuit touches on a longstanding issue of a lack of transparency within DHHS and a history of unilateral changes it has put in place without following proper procedure.
Cavanaugh argued that DHHS should have followed its own regulatory process when implementing the mandate, which would have come with a public hearing or an equivalent step in gathering public feedback.
The complaint also alleges DHHS violated due process and Nebraska’s Administrative Procedure Act. It claims DHHS issued the bulletin without following the “notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures” outlined by the American Psychological Association and argued that the review and appeal process the department offered providers was inadequate.

Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, a Democrat on the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, agreed that this has been a common problem with DHHS.
The complaint highlights a bill Quick introduced earlier this year, Legislative Bill 565, which seeks to crack down on authoritative bulletins issued specifically by DHHS’ Division of Developmental Disabilities. The amended bill would rescind guidance documents issued by the division after July 1, 2022, and pause new bulletins until July 1, 2027, unless the changes were required for federal compliance.
Quick said he brought the bill after hearing concerns from multiple providers that the division was using guidance documents and provider bulletins as a means of implementing major changes without following the department’s regulatory process. He said many of these changes came with high costs.
Quick’s top concern, however, was how such administrative disputes would impact the services’ clients.
“They’re the ones who get hurt in this whole process,” Quick said.
LB 565 stalled in committee, but Quick said after the session he met with DHHS. He claimed officials told him the department had settled the dispute with providers and that the reason for the bulletins is that DHHS’ regulatory process could not keep up with the pace of new federal guidance.
However, when Quick relayed that information to providers, they told him a different story. They claimed that the issue was not settled and that they would have no problem complying with new federal orders.
DHHS said the agency can’t comment on pending litigation.
Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a Republican lawmaker on the HHS Committee, said the lawsuit touches on a gray area between state agency authority and legislative oversight. He couldn’t say whether DHHS overreached with the bulletin but noted the case may boil down to whether ILC had a contract that the department was trying to alter midway through.
“If you don’t have it in writing, you don’t have a real foundation,” Riepe said.

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org
On a Tuesday afternoon in July, inside The Bar Ber Shop in Raleigh, Reggie Winston, 41, talks about a subject many of his young clients rarely discuss anywhere else: mental health. 
Winston, who is trained in mental health first aid and suicide prevention, remembers battling depression in high school without realizing it. “I had no clue what I was experiencing was depression,” he said. It wasn’t until he heard someone else’s story that he recognized his own, a realization that led him to therapy and, eventually, a mission.  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Winston expanded the community work he’d started years earlier with free blood pressure screenings in his shop. This time, he turned to mental health, founding Grooming Resources and Opportunities, a nonprofit that trains barbers to spot signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. 
His method begins with seemingly casual questions when someone climbs into his barber chair. Instead “How are you?” he’ll ask, “What time did you wake up? What are your plans today?” As he snips and shapes, his clients reveal pieces of their lives they rarely share anywhere else.
Slowly, in the safety of his barber chair, these simple inquiries allow clients to reveal what’s really happening in their lives, Winston said.  
“Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.” 
From 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to data. Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide. Among middle schoolers, more than a third reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. 
“The myth that Black people don’t die by suicide has been dangerous,” said Bettie Murchison, a longtime advocate who runs the Village of C.A.R.E. in Wake County. “We’ve had to fight against that in our families, in our churches, and in our schools.”

Winston’s effort is a key part of North Carolina’s response to rising suicide rates among Black youth. This year, the state health department launched the Black Youth Suicide Prevention Action Plan, a five-year initiative that leans on trusted community spaces, including barbershops and churches, to expand support and prevent suicide among Black youth and young adults. Unlike the state’s broader suicide-prevention strategy, this plan focuses on the unique needs of Black youth.  
Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher and one of the plan’s architects, said it was built on listening sessions with young people and their communities. “This is not a top-down plan,” she said. “It’s community-led, community-driven, community-implemented.” 
One of its guiding principles: young people in crisis often turn not to doctors, but to trusted adults in familiar places — coaches, pastors, aunties, barbers. 
“We’re meeting the needs of communities where youth are more likely to seek support. From local YMCAs, churches, and community centers rather than traditional mental health providers,” Richardson said. 
Barbershops and churches 
That’s where Winston and his longtime friend, counselor Rodney Harris, come in. This year alone, he and Harris have trained more than a dozen barbers in mental health first aid training. These programs teach them to spot warning signs of mental distress and suicide, as well as how to safely talk with clients about limiting access to firearms and other deadly means. They’ve trained barbers across Raleigh, Wake Forest and Durham. Soon they’ll be in Rocky Mount. 
“Barbers often know more about their clients’ lives than anyone else,” Harris said. “When a clinician approaches, youth might be skeptical. But when a barber speaks, they listen.” 
Barbershops have become hubs for this work well beyond North Carolina. The Confess Project, for example, has trained barbers across the country in mental health advocacy. 
What’s different with GRO is that they train barbers to become community leaders themselves, Harris said. “What we saw as a gap in the research is to make the barbers trainers and then have them go into the community, offer additional trainings, and then they can also offer recruitment,” Harris said. That work, he added, includes expanding mental health first aid and counseling on access to lethal means, known as CALM.
The same approach is playing out in churches. Through Murchison’s Village of C.A.R.E. program, she trains pastors and faith leaders to act as first responders. “If we can get them to understand this is as much a part of their ministry as teaching the Bible,” she said, “we can reach a generation of youth who don’t see a therapist as their first line of defense.”

 Building trust beyond the shop

State officials have identified 17 counties in North Carolina that are in urgent need of suicide prevention efforts. These counties, which range from major metropolitan areas like Durham, Wake, and Mecklenburg to smaller, rural communities such as Edgecombe, Halifax and Hoke, have the highest rates of Black youth suicides and the highest volume of 988 crisis calls. In each of these communities, Black residents make up at least 25% of the population. 
Still, many young people don’t trust the 988 Lifeline. Black youth are underrepresented among callers, even though they show up disproportionately in emergency room visits for self-injury. Officials say building confidence in the hotline is essential to reaching young people before a crisis escalates.  
Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, said fear and mistrust keep many from using the hotline. “There’s just personal shame, not knowing who’s on the other end, and what’s going to happen,” she said. Some families worry that calling could trigger involuntary hospitalization or even police involvement. “Some of these young folks, their families have already experienced trauma when they’ve tried to engage with treatment systems or government systems,” she added. 










Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.

Mistrust can run even deeper for LGBTQ youth. In North Carolina, Black girls who are questioning their sexual orientation now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. At the same time, the federal government eliminated funding for the 988 “Press 3” option, which connected LGBTQ and transgender callers to specialized counselors. Advocates warn the loss strips away a culturally competent lifeline that has reached more than a million young people nationwide. 
State officials say they have begun training local crisis counselors to handle calls from that population and are working with communities to ensure that 988 operators are equipped with inclusive, culturally aware training. “We’re losing that specialized national line,” Crosbie told NC Health News last month, “but we are making sure our 988 here is well-trained and ready.” 
The state has also launched a youth-led awareness campaign, called “Stronger Together” initiative. Messaging, visuals, and formats are being created by Black youth themselves to make the hotline feel credible and relatable. “We need to get the messaging straight from young people,” Crosbie said. The effort includes training peers and trusted community figures—like pastors, coaches, and barbers—to recognize warning signs and encourage youth to seek help. 
Current data shows texting and chat are the most utilized 988 services among North Carolina youth. Crosbie said that makes it even more important to meet young people where they are—whether that’s on their phones, in churches, or in barbershops. “We need to make sure the help is in places and spaces that people trust,” she said. 
In addition to breaking cultural stigmas surrounding mental health discussions, other strategies include reducing access to lethal means and providing gun locks, and hosting community trainings. 
The first Black youth suicide prevention conference is scheduled for September in Rocky Mount, which is one of the high need areas. Richardson hopes the plan will serve as a national model for suicide prevention among diverse populations. “We are focusing on those populations most impacted in our state… and I think this also provides a blueprint for how to create [prevention strategies] across the state.”
Back at The Bar Ber Shop, Winston says he sees that trust forming every day. Kids sit in his chair for a haircut and end up sharing the things they don’t tell teachers or parents. 
“Barbers are the bridge for people to get the help they need,” Winston said. “We are the trusted few.”

(Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

Patrick Morrisey)WorkForce West Virginia recently released data that shows the state’s labor force has been in a steady decline for the last 14 months.
The Mountain State has lost more than 4,000 jobs and about 7,600 people from its workforce in the last year. The amount of people leaving the workforce is more than the amount of jobs lost because our workforce is aging, retiring and we have a high rate of people with a disability or chronic illness that can’t work or have trouble finding work, according to Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. There’s also people who decide to no longer work so that they can stay home to care for a child or family member.
At least 400 federal jobs have been lost in West Virginia from cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but that number could be higher, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. Data related to those cuts is delayed, and doesn’t include recent layoffs or employees who were placed on administrative leave or took involuntary buyouts. 
The agencies who have been most impacted by those cuts are the Bureau of the Fiscal Service in Parkersburg, NIOSH in Morgantown, the Job Corps Center in Charleston and National Park Service staff in the Monongahela National Forest and the New River Gorge National Park.
The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce is alarmed about the job report.
Chamber President Steve Roberts said when West Virginia was ranked as last in the country for job growth that the chamber started to look into the numbers.
In fact, between 2024 and May 2025, the state had the largest decrease in non-farm employment in the U.S. at 1.3%, according to the report. 
“That’s one of those lists we don’t want to be on. ‘Why don’t we go in and take a deeper dive and take a deeper look? What can we figure out is going on?’ and the more we looked, the more concerned we became,” Roberts told WV MetroNews.
WorkForce West Virginia’s jobs report showed that several key industries — hospitality, manufacturing, mining and retail — all have declining numbers. 
Roberts said the workforce “has shifted from being a manual labor workforce to a digital workforce, and we need to tell our children that.”
“We really have to look at education, how we’re performing, and what we can do to help our kids be more prepared for the future,” he said.
Sounds like investing in our public schools and teachers would be a great way to address job loss.
At the Chamber of Commerce’s Business Summit last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey revealed his big economic plan to try to get the state’s job numbers back up — cutting regulations, investing in energy and scrutinizing the use of taxpayer dollars to lure businesses into West Virginia.
Cutting regulations sounds worrying, especially if it’s environmental regulations, which Morrisey has proven not to be a fan of. However, he did give a good example — a bill passed this year that allows occupational licensing reciprocity, which allows new residents to transfer their occupational and professional licenses from another state to West Virginia. 
If that’s the kind of regulations we’re cutting, then great. But if he’s going to follow in President Donald Trump’s footsteps — which he most often does — we might see Morrisey trying to cut health and safety regulations that are meant to protect workers. Risking people’s health and lives to help businesses is never the answer.
To invest in energy, Morrisey launched his “Economic Backyard Brawl,” to focus on developing energy infrastructure to compete with other states. This is where the microgrids and data centers come in that residents are overwhelmingly opposing throughout the state.
Morrisey ended his speech at the summit talking about how the state’s workforce could be improved — by doing a complete “overhaul” of the WorkForce West Virginia website.
“Recruiting, retention and retraining has to be one of our big hallmarks,” Morrisey said. 
You know what would help with recruitment and retention? Do literally anything to help with child care. Lawmakers need to start thinking of the children. Investing in child care is imperative.
Research by the tech company Wonderschool found that about half of West Virginia businesses reported that child care challenges frequently or very frequently affected their employees’ ability to work. And 70% reported they were doing nothing to help with those challenges.
We’ve had two legislative sessions where lawmakers said lack of affordable child care is a major problem and then did nothing to help the industry or the families that need it. There are areas with no child care and where there are facilities most have very limited spots. How can people work if there’s no one to watch their children? Or if they can’t even afford to put them in daycare?
Child care centers are losing money, resulting in closures. I can’t think of a better place to use some of that $254.8 million surplus in the state budget.

In western Michigan, a previously defunct nuclear plant has transitioned back to operating status following the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to reauthorize power operations.
As of Aug. 25, the Palisades Power Plant is the first nuclear plant in the United States to transition from decommissioning status back to operations, according to the plant’s owner, Holtec International.
The former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, will follow in the Michigan plant’s footsteps. Constellation Energy is currently working to reopen the nuclear facility — renamed Crane Clean Energy Center — by 2027. That’s a year earlier than initially expected.
It is slated to power data centers for Microsoft. An agreement reached between the tech company and Constellation is reported to last 20 years, could create around 3,400 jobs and bring $3 billion in state and federal taxes.
The Michigan plant can begin receiving nuclear fuel and restart operations once certain conditions of the plant’s technical specifications are met.
While the company works on repairing the plant’s steam generators, alongside reassembling the main generator and turbine, Holtec says the plant is squarely in the final phase of its restart preparations.
“This is a proud and historic moment for our team, for Michigan, and for the United States,” Holtec International President Kelly Trice said in a statement. “The [commision’s] approval to transition Palisades back to an operating license represents an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy. Our mission remains clear: to restart Palisades safely, securely, reliably, and in support of America’s energy future – while supporting local jobs and economic growth for decades to come.”

Upon returning to operations, Holtec said the facility will produce 800 megawatts of electricity, enough to power over 800,000 homes and businesses.
While the plant has received support from Michigan Democrats and Republicans alike, the plant is not without its opponents, with Kevin Kamps of the anti-nuclear advocacy group Beyond Nuclear arguing lawmakers and regulators are “playing radioactive Russian roulette on the Lake Michigan shore.”
“Holtec’s Palisades zombie reactor restart scheme is not only unprecedented, but also unneeded, insanely expensive for taxpayers and ratepayers, and very risky for health, safety, security and the environment,” Kamps said in a statement.
Opponents of the plant’s restart have argued the funds used to restart the plant – including a $1.5 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and $300 million in state funding – could be better spent on renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
Residents living near the plant have also raised health concerns with a survey of 702 full and part-time residents living 400 yards to a mile from the reactor finding those individuals were five times more likely to develop thyroid cancer in their lifetime than the rest of the nation.

Domestic violence drives other violent crime in Kentucky and contributes to criminal recidivism all while draining law enforcement and court resources across the commonwealth, reports the Council of State Governments.
Over the past two years, the council’s Justice Center dug into Kentucky’s domestic violence data. Representatives from the nonpartisan organization presented their wide-ranging findings to the legislature’s Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary Friday. 
David D’Amora, a senior policy advisor at the Justice Center, said Kentucky has a “high prevalence of domestic violence and victimization,” which is a “major driver” of other violent crime. Reducing this crime by 25% could save the state $10 million over five years. 
After 2 women die in ‘ambush’ outside Hardin courthouse, what can Kentucky do better?

Kentucky has higher rates of domestic violence than the national average: 48% of Kentucky women will experience intimate partner violence or stalking, compared with 47% nationally. About 52% of men in Kentucky will also experience this, which is higher than the national percentage of 44%, according to the center’s data. 
The state does well in several ways, he said, including passing a law in 2025 to stiffen penalties for those who violate protective orders. 
Still, D’Amora said, “there’s significant room for improvement in how the commonwealth supports and provides resources to victims.” 
Kentucky does not compensate victims through the Office of Victims of Crime as much as most of its neighbors. This office helps victims pay for medical and funeral expenses, mental health treatment or other necessary costs.

“Some of this just has to do with the complication and how people file or need to file,” D’Amora said. “It’s not Kentucky’s unwillingness to do so, but there are just some barriers in the way that make it difficult for folks to file and get that compensation.” 
Just 3% of Kentucky domestic violence victims receive compensation. That’s higher than 2.6% in Indiana but lower than Tennessee (5%), Illinois (5.7%), Ohio (6.7%), Missouri (9%), West Virginia (11%) and Virginia (28%). 
Center researchers “had to stop” before finishing their analysis of Kentucky’s domestic violence landscape, D’Amora said, because “federal funding that was available for this work went away.” 
“We wanted to come back to present what we were able to find before we had to stop,” he said. “We’re here today on our own dime. We’re not here today because the federal folks are continuing to fund the project. The project is over, and we had to stop sort of midstream.” 
By the numbers
 Over the six-year period analyzed by the Council of State Governments, around half of all of the violent crimes in Kentucky involved domestic violence
Over the six-year period analyzed by the Council of State Governments, around half of all of the violent crimes in Kentucky involved domestic violence.
Between 2016–2021, of the 228,201 crimes, 108,401 — 48% — were related to interpersonal violence. 
“We suspect that it is higher than that,” D’Amora said. “What we know from research is that when we look at the (National Incident-Based Reporting System) numbers, that the incidents where alcohol or drugs are involved, there’s typically significant under reporting. It would not surprise me if we were looking at close to double that amount in these types of crimes.” 
Other data presented to the committee showed: 

From 2016 to 2021, 22% of homicide victims, 62% of kidnapping victims and 59% of simple assaults were also survivors of intimate partner violence.
From 2016 to 2021, alcohol and/or drugs were involved in at least 24% of all intimate partner violence cases. 
Both incidents of intimate partner violence and arrests increased over the six years the council analyzed. 
From 2008 to 2022, charges filed in Kentucky regarding violations of protective orders are up 43%. Convictions for those violations have increased 124%. 
From 2016-2022, filings for temporary protective orders increased by nearly 10%. The number of permanent orders granted during that same time period decreased by about 23%. 
As of September 2024, about 84% of law enforcement officers did not have screening tools to evaluate the level of danger a survivor of domestic violence was in. Nearly 90% of officers surveyed at that time reported having policies on how to respond to domestic violence and 97% said they’d received some guidance. 
In 2022, 33% of people in Department of Corrections custody had been defendants in prior domestic violence-related civil protective order cases. 
In 2022, 26% of people under supervision from the Department of Corrections had been defendants in prior domestic violence-related civil protective order cases. 
From 2018-2022, about 8% of perpetrators were reported in two or more incidents over the five year period. Repeat calls to the same location are a “key issue” in these cases, D’Amora said, adding that targeting response efforts on those repeat offenders could help reduce recidivism. 
In 2022, there were about 39,000 law enforcement responses to domestic violence reports and 9,472 arrests. Each of these cases can take more time than other calls and more officers per response. Meanwhile, 80% of law enforcement around Kentucky said they don’t have a large enough staff to effectively handle the caseload. 

 From 2016 to 2021, 22% of homicide victims, 62% of kidnapping victims and 59% of simple assaults were also survivors of intimate partner violence.
Looking to North Carolina 
The High Point Police Department in North Carolina has seen “substantial reductions” in its domestic violence recidivism by targeting people who’ve already offended, D’Amora shared as a potential model for Kentucky to study. 
“The model has them identifying the people who are most likely to commit violent crimes, investigating carefully and prosecuting, pursuing criminal charges, notifying them that future crimes will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, offering resources in the community to help people who commit (domestic violence) change their lifestyles, following up with those people in their progress to ensure they’re not committing further crimes, and then evaluating each case to determine if the individual was helped,” he said. 
These interventions lowered their rates of interpersonal violence homicides, domestic disturbance calls, domestic violence reoffenses and more. Victim injuries and arrests fell from around 67% to 47%, according to the council’s data. 
“Did they make it go away? No,” D’Amora said. “Did they significantly increase public safety? Yes, very much so, as well as helping lower the number of resources that were being used for this problem.” 
 Kentucky has higher rates of domestic violence than the national average: 48% of Kentucky women will experience intimate partner violence or stalking, compared with 47% nationally. About 52% of men in Kentucky will also experience this, which is higher than the national percentage of 44%, according to the center’s data.

This is the view to the east from the Pinnacles. (Photo by Whitney McKnight, The Edge)BEREA — Five property owners in Madison County’s Big Hill, Pilot Knob and Red Lick communities plus a few more in adjoining Jackson County were among the last to know the details of a plan to build a nearly nine-mile long transmission line through their respective properties.
Eastern Kentucky Power Cooperative’s first public announcement that it would construct the 69 kilovolt Big Hill-Three Links line (aka, the Big Hill line), and a substation on Red Lick Road, came in the form of a legally mandated letter, sent in September 2023, to area residents determined by the co-op to be most impacted by the development.
The letter told of a meeting to be held a couple of weeks later at Berea College’s Forestry Outreach Center where all would be explained. 
The letter did not reach all relevant addresses, instead arriving at several homes which were not in the direct path of the transmission line. But word spread quickly among neighbors, and on the night of the meeting, the room was filled to overflowing with people who wanted answers to their many questions.
Questions such as, why had no one in the neighborhood been consulted about the plan for the power line before it was determined? What did this mean for property values? What about the view from the Pinnacles? What might be the impact on the watershed for Owsley Fork reservoir, the primary water source for much of the county and all of Berea? Would the line adversely impact tourism in an area popular with outdoor enthusiasts?
Area resident Nicole Garneau recalled the scene in an interview with The Edge. “We all came with our questions, but it wasn’t a real meeting. EKPC had little stations where it was one of their people to one of ours. It was divide and conquer. It’s not like there were chairs arranged so we could sit together and listen to someone talk to everyone all at once and answer our questions so everyone could hear the answer.”

Garneau, who lives in Clear Creek, does not own property directly impacted by the line, but says she enjoys spending time in the wooded landscape that surrounds the reservoir and on the Pinnacles, a network of trails in the Berea College Forest leading to sweeping views from popular overlooks.
She began walking around the room where the meeting was being held, waving protest signs she and others had made in advance of the meeting. Then she grabbed a microphone and demanded the representatives from the power co-op face the crowd.
That night at the Forestry Outreach Center marks the beginning of a now two-years long struggle to demand the power cooperative listen to its member constituents and be transparent about its movements to build the line. 
Their success, however, has been minimal according to some.
“One thing the Big Hill Line exemplifies is the inability of the people to be able to actually participate in the government,” activist and Berean Bugz Fraugg told The Edge in a text. “People were willing to come together to understand the project and to negotiate. EKPC has been unwilling to have frank conversations with concerned constituents that will be impacted by the Big Hill Line, whether or not they are land owners. Poor communication seems to be their strategy.”
Amber Falle and her husband, Marty, Jackson County property owners who are being sued by EKPC in an eminent domain case, are among those who believe the power cooperative deliberately avoids communicating clearly about its intentions. 
“We never got that letter they supposedly sent out in September,” Amber told The Edge in an interview. “We didn’t get a letter until February 2024,” she said. 
Robert McNamara, deputy litigation director for The Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm in the Washington, D.C. area, told The Edge in an interview that property owners potentially impacted by eminent domain are typically given as little information as possible by the entity doing the taking. “They are likely the last to know about plans that might involve condemnation,” he said. Condemnation is the technical term for when land is taken for public use. 
 Increased demand for power 

EKPC, along with other power utilities across the state, are under pressure to improve and expand Kentucky’s aging power grid, particularly as demand for energy increases to support the Beshear administration’s bid for rapid high-tech industrial growth across the commonwealth.

Federal statistics show that Kentucky is already one of the nation’s most energy-intensive economies, ranking among the top 10 states for amount of energy used per dollar of gross domestic product. 
Industry is the state’s largest energy consumer, accounting for more than a third of all end-use energy consumption statewide. Add in the state’s new electric vehicle battery factories, plus the increasing number of data centers and that usage is predicted by EKPC’s regional transmission organization to soar.
EKPC is part of the regional grid known as PJM, so-named for its original founding states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. The PJM regional transmission organization now includes Kentucky, several other states and the District of Columbia.
PJM’s long range forecast released earlier this year is for summer peak energy demand in the region to more than triple in the next 15 years, from 70,000 megawatts, to 220,000 megawatts. The PJM notes in its report that current energy usage projections equal the fastest rising demand for power since 2006, and specifies data centers and EV battery manufacturing as key to this trend.
“EKPC is taking steps to prevent outages from happening,” EKPC spokesperson, Nick Comer, told The Edge in an email. “During extreme cold weather in January 2025, high electricity usage caused substation equipment [serving the southern end of the county] to operate near its capacity, threatening overload, which could cause power outages for homes and businesses.”
Comer said that the majority of the power cooperative members in the southeastern part of Madison County are served by a substation that currently serves 4,100 meters, “more than any other substation in EKPC’s system”. 
Once the Big Hill line is completed, only about 1,500 meters will be connected to the substation on Red Lick Road, he said. “This will provide more flexibility to serve these homes with electricity from either the south or the north, reducing the risk of outages,” Comer said.
Questions about the line remain
The power co-op claims it has accommodated local residents impacted by the line. “EKPC has listened and responded to the concerns of the community and affected property owners about potential impacts of this project,” Comer wrote in the email. “EKPC is taking reasonable steps to mitigate impacts while ensuring reliable electric service.”
Opponents disagree.

When the power co-op sued Berea College earlier this summer to condemn less than a mile of the forest to build a portion of the transmission line, the college responded by demanding answers to multiple questions about how and why EKPC planned to build the line, and what other alternatives exist — questions, the college said in a statement, it has been asking the power utility to answer since the outset in 2023. 
The college’s response to EKPC’s complaint, filed with the Madison County Circuit Court, also demanded a slew of documents the college said EKPC had previously been unwilling to produce, including proof of an environmental impact study.
The utility has until Sept. 15 to respond, but has since issued a public statement indicating it has conducted a federally stipulated environmental study, saying the study has been, “reviewed and approved by the Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.” The statement also reiterated that the power co-op, “has listened and responded to the concerns of the community and affected property owners about potential impacts of this project.”
Previous attempts by the Kentucky Resource Council to receive evidence of an environmental impact study also went unanswered in the past.
 Potential environmental impacts

The Edge requested a copy of the impact report from EKPC but did not receive it. A letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Division’s Kentucky field office, however, indicates it assessed the area to be impacted by the line and that while several species of bats possibly may be imperiled — the Indiana bat in particular, is likely to be adversely impacted — other damage would be minimal. EKPC has not publicly addressed the matter of the potential fate of the Indiana bats. 
In the statement, EKPC did however, address concerns about the line marring the viewshed from the Pinnacles, saying the line would be screened largely (but not entirely) by Pilot Knob. In the statement, the utility dodged the questions of how the line might impinge on the bucolic feel of Windswept, the College’s retreat and conference center overlooking Owsley Fork reservoir, also home to an observatory. The College demanded an answer in its response to EKPC’s suit.
The city of Berea had contracted an engineering firm to assess the line’s potential impact on the water quality of the reservoir, the source for the city’s water. The engineering report concluded the line “would not result in a significant enough impact on water quality.” Therefore, EKPC pledged in its statement to follow the firm’s best practices for vegetation management around the transmission lines.
“EKPC is continuing right-of-way acquisition and plans to commence clearing and construction in 2026,” Comer said.

They designed a self-driving rescue vehicle to help. (Photo provided by Clemson University.A group of Clemson University engineering students watched the nonstop news last September as Helene tore a path of death and destruction through the Carolinas and Tennessee.
The raging floodwaters that isolated the storm’s victims prompted them to question: What if a team of medics could have driven into mountain towns and far-flung homesteads with a Humvee loaded with supplies? And what if they could have sent the vehicle back on its own to transport injured and rescued passengers?
That was the inspiration behind the latest research project conducted by students in the Upstate university’s Deep Orange program.
A team of 17 students equipped a self-driving vehicle that could be deployed by search and rescue teams.
 A self-driving rescue vehicle was the 16th project of Clemson University’s Deep Orange program. (Photo provided by Clemson University.)
“This is really important, because in a rescue situation, you obviously want to get to people as quickly as possible. And if you have any injured people, you want to get them out of harm’s way as quickly as possible,” said automotive engineering professor Rob Prucka. “So that’s the kind of work that we’re trying to do.”
Prucka is the director of the Deep Orange program, which has an ongoing, autonomous vehicle research partnership with the U.S. Army.
The project, completed this past spring, marks the 16th iteration of Deep Orange, in which industry leaders give each cohort of students a problem to solve during the course of their studies.
That’s why the vehicle was dubbed Deep Orange 16.
“Deep Orange pushes us to think like real-world engineers,” said team leader Rohit Godse, who graduated in August with a master’s degree in automotive engineering. “We are not just learning theory, but solving complex, high-stakes problems that prepare us to lead in the industry from day one.”
“We’re trying to produce engineers that will be valuable to the auto industry the day they leave Clemson,” Prucka added.
The program also seeks to test technological advancements that automakers or the military may one day use — in this case, a rescue vehicle controlled by software that could be used in combat or stateside during a natural disaster.
One thing Prucka said the team heard over and over from first responders they interviewed is many never know the situation they’re walking into until they get there. They have maybe half the information they need. And it may or may not be correct. So, they need a vehicle that’s ready for anything.
“And maybe the car itself could be an extra helping hand,” Prucka said.
One of the new capabilities the team added to the off-road vehicle included camera systems for looking ahead and sensors for scanning the ground. The vehicle could then use its computing systems to analyze those images and readings on the fly and automatically adjust its suspension accordingly to create a smoother ride.
Those same camera and sensor systems also map the route in, so the vehicle can travel back out without someone controlling it from the driver’s seat.
And in off-road situations, visibility becomes an added challenge.
“If you crest a hill, you can’t usually see over the hill,” Prucka said. “If you’re in a really rocky train, you can’t always tell what exactly a tire is going to run over.”
A 360-degree view from the cameras reduces the number of blind spots operators might have.

Finally, while less high tech, students designed a stretcher-loading mechanism for the back of the vehicle to lift injured passengers.
“On the surface it looks simple in a way,” Prucka said. “But it’s intentional because the soldiers all said this thing needs to work every time. It can’t be complicated. But it does help some challenges that they have actually loading patients into the vehicle, especially, when they’re under distress.”
“Our students are not only driving innovation — they’re helping to save lives by improving how we respond to emergencies in the most challenging environments,” Prucka added.
Deep Orange 16 will remain at Clemson as a prototype.
Future classes will continue to test and improve the technology that could eventually be used in rescue operations.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
A new state law set to take effect next month marks the end of New Hampshire’s flirtation with offshore wind — at least for now.


The measure, signed into law by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, shortens the name of the Office of Offshore Wind Industry Development and Energy Innovation to simply the Office of Energy Innovation. As the name change suggests, the legislation also removes the office’s mandate to support offshore wind development, and dissolves two efforts to create workforce training programs and develop ports serving the offshore wind industry.


“It’s definitely discouraging, practically and symbolically, when it comes to our region moving toward offshore wind as a meaningful part of the energy mix,” said Mireille Bejjani, co-executive director of New England-based environmental advocacy group Slingshot.


The move comes as President Donald Trump attempts to stop the emerging offshore wind industry in its tracks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order pausing all permitting and lease sales for new projects, and in the months that followed his administration has attempted to halt the construction of fully permitted offshore wind developments, including, most recently, the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.
R.I. leaders want Revolution Wind stop work order reversed. And they want it now.



Other governors in New England, a region that has been counting on offshore wind for climate action and grid reliability, have been resolute in pushing projects forward. In fact, every coastal New England state aside from New Hampshire is party to a lawsuit seeking to overturn Trump’s offshore wind executive order.


The law marks a shift from the stance taken by previous governor, Republican Chris Sununu, who was in office from 2017 to 2025.


Swing state New Hampshire has long been a libertarian-leaning outlier in deeply Democratic New England. On climate and energy issues, New Hampshire has generally been less aggressive than neighboring states: It doesn’t have legally mandated greenhouse gas reduction targets, has pulled back on energy-efficiency goals and programming, and recently all but drained its renewable energy fund to pay for other state needs.











Offshore wind has the potential to realize many positive economic, energy, and environmental impacts for New Hampshire and our neighboring states.


– Former Gov. Chris Sununu




For a time, however, the state seemed on the verge of embracing offshore wind. In 2019, Sununu asked the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to convene a task force to facilitate regional cooperation and discussion about the potential for wind development in the Gulf of Maine. The next year, the state created a commission to study offshore wind and port development, and in 2021 the Office of Offshore Wind Industry Development and Energy Innovation was formed and funded. In 2022, the state released an in-depth report that found offshore wind could accelerate the reduction of carbon emissions and create good-paying jobs.


“Offshore wind has the potential to realize many positive economic, energy, and environmental impacts for New Hampshire and our neighboring states,” Sununu wrote in the introduction to the report.


This year’s legislative session, however, saw a flurry of bills aimed at keeping the New Hampshire government out of the business of offshore wind. One proposal even sought to ban its development outright.


The recently signed law is less aggressive, pulling away from offshore wind without prohibiting it. To soften the blow further, the state Senate, led by Democratic state Sen. David Watters, amended the legislation to make it clear that the energy innovation office would still have the authority to do work related to offshore wind if interest is revived in the future.

“The bill as it finally passed still kept a toehold in state government for being able to respond to or prepare for future offshore wind development,” Watters said.


During the legislative process, however, it was clear that many interested parties saw the bill as a referendum on offshore wind in general, not merely the structure of government offices and committees. Public comments during a House hearing on the bill in February dwelled heavily on the perceived dangers of offshore wind, including potential threats to wildlife, possible hikes in electricity prices, and concerns about the intermittent nature of wind power.


The movement against offshore wind, observers said, is driven by a mix of national conservative hostility toward renewable energy and New Hampshire’s unique character. The state Senate is reasonably open to renewables, Watters said. However, the 400-member House — the largest state legislative body in the country, by a wide margin — is far more averse, he said.


Furthermore, the state has always been fiscally conservative, priding itself on its lack of sales and personal income taxes. It was always unlikely to offer tax incentives, like neighboring states, or take the risk of getting locked into a power purchase agreement at prices that could exceed market rates, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire.


“New Hampshire was never going to be the state that drove the offshore wind industry,” he said.


Still, some clean energy advocates are concerned that the offshore wind law is a troublesome step backwards when the state needs to be charging ahead on renewables. There is widespread agreement that New England needs more power supply to help control soaring electricity prices and maintain grid reliability. At the same time, observers said, restraints on natural gas supplies make more gas-fired power generation unlikely, and building new nuclear facilities would be contentious; either option would take years to begin sending electrons into the grid.


Now, the Trump administration continues to throw up as many roadblocks as possible to offshore wind, potentially scuttling what may be the region’s best — and speediest — chance to build large-scale energy generation.


It makes no sense to let ideological objections to renewable energy get in the way of considering all available resources, said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.


“They’ll say they are for all-of-the-above energy, but don’t even want to consider offshore wind,” he said. ​“They’re not really looking at the full picture.”


For others, the new law is a reasonable response to political realities in New Hampshire. If the state was never going to be a major supporter of offshore wind, it makes sense to focus the Office of Energy Innovation on measures that might actually have a fighting chance, Evans-Brown said, pointing to microgrids, battery developments, demand-flexibility programs, and electrification as promising options that would help the state make the most of the power production it has.


Advocates and policymakers across the board, however, are holding on to hope that while the state explores other courses of action, the development of offshore wind is merely delayed.
“I do think [it] is likely to come back,” Watters said. ​“But I am a very pragmatic legislator: We’re just going to have to have a pause on offshore wind.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/point-judith-RI-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 05:56:59.130617

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)We are living in the age of cowards, and it started even before Donald Trump sealed his reelection.
September marks one year since I had the misfortune of witnessing University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto and other top university presidents get their heads handed to them in an Interim Joint Committee on Education. Their task over two long hours? To placate, to ensure our GOP supermajority in Frankfort that any whiff of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) had already been stripped from university governance and class syllabi.
Near the end of the meeting, I checked my phone to see that Ricky L. Jones — a professor from the University of Louisville who was also in the audience — had posted on his social media, “The McCarthyite Committee has now called the Presidents of Eastern Kentucky, Western Kentucky, and Murray State to all testify at once. They’re being handled like the B-Team. On another note, ONE of the THREE Black legislators just returned to the room.”
Jones was right. From the sneering arrogance of Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, one of the main interrogators, to the timidity of the university presidents in the spotlight, everything about that meeting felt un-American and disgusting. And it was equally crushing to see many of our elected officials up there on panel, who surely know better, barely push back.
Where, I wondered, was their courage? Where were our leaders?
The issues of missing courage and absent leadership have grown exponentially worse since President Donald Trump took office, again, in January.
From Washington D.C. to Kentucky, the sycophantic stranglehold this one man has on the leaders we deem most powerful has been shocking to see. 










It is like watching all of the dominoes loudly fall and wondering who is going to do the work to, one by one, stand them upright again.


Where are the officials — in Kentucky and all over the country — that we elected to Congress to represent OUR interests? By all reports, most of them are in absentia, avoiding constituent town halls back home like vampires in sunlight while cheering on the president from behind the safe space of their social media feeds.
As men like Daniel Cameron, Nate Morris and Andy Barr fight harder for the Trump endorsement than they do for the votes of Kentuckians, we should consider whom exactly they intend on serving if awarded a six-year U.S. Senate term — the 4.5 million citizens they represent or the tyrant in the Oval Office who can, with a tweet, destroy their careers?
Do our representatives work for us or for the president?
We get the answer to that question every day.
Congress was sent home early for their summer break to avoid dealing with potential shockwaves in the Epstein files. The Federal Emergency Management Agency suspended staff who dared to criticize the president over what they deemed dangerous cuts. The president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics hours after a weaker-than-expected jobs report because the numbers did not adhere to the fantasy he’s peddling to Americans that jobs are on the rise because of his immigration crackdown. He has shaken down some of this nation’s most lauded universities claiming, without proof, that they have been “infested with radicalism.”
The president now claims, in opposition to statistics, there is a violent crime emergency in our nation’s capital to justify deployment and federalization of National Guard troops from a number of red states to Washington D.C. and has threatened to do the same in other Democratic-led cities, even at the refusal of those states’ governors.
The last time I was in Washington D.C., I met up with friends from the U.S. Army War College who worked at the Pentagon. We took a nighttime boat ride on the Potomac so they could show me the monuments lit up from the water; we grabbed beers at a pub in Georgetown; we peeked inside the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs who was, that minute, arriving outside via black SUV motorcade so we had to be quick.
I would not make that trip to Washington D.C. today. In a lifetime of U.S. and international travel, I’ve learned that a basic rule of thumb is that it is unsafe to be in any city occupied by armed military. The president, in his unhinged marketing blitz to make himself look like a strongman, has made local law enforcement look like ninnies and effectively warned tourists (and the money they spend) to stay away.
And yet, he remains unchallenged by anyone who could stop him.
 Sen. Robby Mills chimed in on X to support Trump’s stand against mail-in voting.
In a testament to today’s rampant toadyism, even Republicans in leadership at the Kentucky legislature are quick to tout any Trump talking point in order to grab his gaze.
State Sen. Robby Mills — former candidate for lieutenant governor and current Senate majority caucus chair — recently posted a Trump video about mail-in ballots and wrote, in part, “I stand with President Trump…it’s time to end mail-in voting! I am not referring to absentee voting, which KY has and is controled [sic] and secured through an electronic portal. I am referring to the states that mail every registered voter a ballot and allows for ballot harvesting. This must end!”
Kentucky does not have mail-in voting. 
I am unaware of any plans by our secretary of state to introduce mail-in voting. 
So why is Mills so publicly het up (“This must end!”) about something that is not happening here and falls completely outside the purview of his office?
Because Mills knows what all those in power know: Publicly fawning and praising and sucking up to the current occupant of the Oval Office every chance they get (see how Cameron, Morris and Barr are behaving in their Senate runs) will either keep them in power or get them there.
The story of Kentucky’s university presidents being hauled to Frankfort for a humiliating spanking last September was an advance-notice reality check. That meeting did feel McCarthyite, and yet we all treated it as normal. It was one of many signs to come that — whether it be a university president making big money or a lawmaker in state or federal government — we are witnessing abject cowardice in our leaders on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.
It is like watching all of the dominoes loudly fall and wondering who is going to do the work to, one by one, stand them upright again.
Everyone keeps asking: Where are the Democrats? What are the Democrats doing? What is their plan, their platform, their social media game plan, etc…? 
We are wasting time, and we are asking all the wrong questions. 
In this age of categorical, across the board, capitulation and cowardice — as a 78 year-old man, wearing a red hat in the Oval Office, denigrates the free press while exercising his stranglehold on everyone from billionaires to business executives to lawmakers to military leaders to university presidents — we are a population desperate for those with real courage, real convictions and real voices to reveal themselves. No matter their political party.
How much longer will we have to wait?
How much of who we are as Americans will be irreparably destroyed before we rebuild?
Where in the hell are our leaders?

Left to right are Kendra Gay, Lexy Bulman, and Co-Director Jim Corwin. (Photo by Julia Steiny/Rhode Island Current)When lunch winds down at Garvin Elementary School in Cumberland, the kids take their trays to the food recycling line. They sort their lunch detritus into well-marked bins and buckets. A fifth grade “food waste ranger” oversees the process, monitoring what goes into which container to avoid contaminating the contents. 
The line starts at a table for food that could be redistributed — unopened milk cartons, power bars, wrapped cheese sticks — and a basket for intact fruit and vegetables. If kids are still hungry, they can pick up something extra there thanks to support from the RI School Recycling Project.  Every one of the 52 schools that participated in the program last year received a refrigerator to store perishables. That food is distributed to hungry students and food insecure families, who are about 30% of Rhode Island’s population. (School staff who are close to the families stock backpacks for those they know need help.)
Next, students move past the waste-collection station which has a bucket for pouring leftover liquids, along with a bin marked “recycle” with pictures of what can be recycled, and another for trash that can’t go anywhere but the Central Landfill in Johnston, like plastic bags and straws. The last stop collects food scraps — apple cores and banana peels that will go to the school’s commercial composting partner. A few schools make their own compost.
On the day I visited Garvin at the end of May, it was “zero waste” day, so kids were especially jazzed because a completely empty, sorted tray earned them a sticker and maybe a prize, like a T-shirt. 
Lest this seems like a cool but small stakes school activity, consider this: 
In the 2023-2024 school year, preliminary data from 42 of the participating schools shows that more than 227 tons of food waste was diverted. Each school does its own waste audit.
According to Anthesis Global: One ton of Co2 is equivalent to the electricity consumption of 0.65 average households for a year. Driving a gasoline car for 5,000 miles. Taking 72 high-speed train trips of 300 miles each. 2.6 round-trip flights between New York and Miami. Rescuing Leftover Cuisine says that 227 tons is the equivalent of 35,000 meals. 
More than greenhouse gases, though, the kids focus on Rhode Island’s one and only landfill run by the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC). A 2015 report warned that the landfill was filling so quickly, it would close in 2038. For the record, Connecticut’s landfills are already full, so the state sends about 40% of their solid waste to Ohio or Pennsylvania at a cost of just under $100 million a year. Rhode Island could be in the same boat in the not-too-distant future.
Since that report came out a decade ago, efforts including this one by the RI School Recycling Project have bought the state more time, extending the state landfill’s closure date to 2045. 
In response to pleas from the quasi-public agency that operates the landfill, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a law in 2014 banning food waste, but with caveats.. Unfortunately, the law was another toothless unfunded mandate, like much of education legislation. But partner agencies and philanthropies generously stepped in to fund the RI School Recycling Project.
Back in Garvin’s lunchroom, the vigilant food-waste fifth grader minding the stations, told me his interest was “To keep the landfill from filling up.”
“This way we can stay here and not put a landfill in our town,” he added.
Of course, Cumberland is under no such threat. But the project pays for second-year student rangers to take a field trip to the top of the garbage mountain where they gape at its impressive quantity. The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation education staff teach students about the realities of mindlessly tossing solid waste. (You can take that tour too.) 










The vigilant food-waste fifth grader minding the stations, told me his interest was 'To keep the landfill from filling up.'


The corporation developed a curriculum for young people about methane, its toxic effects, and about greenhouse gasses in general. Students learn that on any given school day in Rhode Island, just under 28,000 pounds of compostable food goes into the landfill. Of that, 4,000 pounds is food that is perfectly fine and could be redistributed. Tiny Rhode Island’s public schools generate 5 million pounds of food waste a year.
Teachers adapt curricula to build on what students are learning from this real life experience, including having the kids collect the data to calculate the waste audit.
Furthermore, the project saves money. Redirecting the recyclables reduces the number of dumpsters the school needs, along with the tipping fees for the landfill. Warren Heyman, the project’s operations director, said a Warwick school was putting a dozen bags of trash a day into its dumpster. 
“On the first day we implemented our program, the school only took out two bags of trash, around 10 pounds,” Heyman said. “That’s 50 fewer bags a week. That’s one less full dumpster of trash a week.”
Granting agencies are so enthused about this work, they’ve recently given enough money to bring on another 50 schools in the new school year that begins Tuesday in Cumberland for first through ninth grade students. All grades are in session Wednesday.
The money pays for the skeletal, part-time staff of two, Co-Director Jim Corwin, and Heyman, plus stipends for volunteers. The project welcomes volunteers to help them double their reach. 
Training sessions for interested volunteers began last week.To learn more, contact Heyman by filling out the contact form on the project’s website. 
The project offers educational materials and techniques to help schools get started and stay active. Also covered are the fridges, field trips, containers, prizes and the fees for composting companies to take the food scraps. (See available companies on page 15 of this presentation.) 
After a well-deserved rest, Corwin and Heyman had a super busy summer. They’ve got their hands full, but they dearly hope grocery stores and restaurants catch the recycling bug.
If the kids can do it, so can they.

Even before the global health crisis, passengers were often unable to determine a train’s arrival time or which side of the tracks to board, creating chaos and prompting volunteers to step onto the tracks to help look for lights or signs of the next locomotive. 
“They’re coming into my visitor center for help, and I’m not going to turn them away,” said Novak, the center’s manager. “I need to help them and that’s part of what we do.”
After years of coordination and effort, the Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) has debuted, designed to inform passengers using the Ashland and Richmond Main Street stations — neither of which has in-person staff — about upcoming trains through displays and a speaker system. As part of the system, Amtrak will notify passengers of updates from its PIDS Operations Center between the two stations at Richmond Staples Mill.

PIDS provides customers with real-time information on train arrivals and departures, as well as track assignments, in both audible and visual formats, Amtrak said in March when it announced the upgrades at the Main Street Station. The system can also announce essential update information during service disruptions and includes an adaptive sound system that adjusts to different environmental noise levels.
As of March 28, Virginia stations equipped with PIDS include Lynchburg, Newport News, Norfolk, Petersburg, Williamsburg, and the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond. Amtrak Virginia trains offer direct service to the Main Street Station to and from Newport News, Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., and as far north as Boston, according to the company.
“Amtrak is committed to providing timely and accurate customer communications across all channels – in stations, on board trains, via our mobile apps and our various web-based platforms,” said David Handera, Amtrak vice president of accessibility and Stations & facilities Chief Administrative Officer, in a March statement. “Thanks to VPRA, the City of Richmond and our dedicated, multi-departmental team for this modern and accessible system that will enhance the travel experience.”
 Improving public safety, ridership experience

The Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, which manages the commonwealth’s state-supported Amtrak Virginia passenger rail service, has worked with the transit provider on the upgrades to enhance public safety and improve the ridership experience.
“If people have proper information, that is going to reduce the possibility that someone could have a safety incident on the tracks,” said Mike McLaughlin, VPRA’s chief operating officer.
At the Ashland station, McLaughlin said passengers are unable to cross to the other side of the track once a train has arrived, which is why information about where the train will arrive is essential.
In comparison, at the Fredericksburg train stop, travelers can use an underpass to walk underneath the tracks. However, it can still be challenging for those who need more time to board.
Ensuring passengers have up-to-date information was another priority, McLaughlin said.
“We live in the 21st century, where people come to appreciate that and people come to expect that, and the customer needs that information,” McLaughlin said.
Knowing their train’s arrival time can also help passengers manage their time better and determine if they have enough spare time to grab a snack or pop into a nearby shop, which is a potential revenue booster for local businesses.
“I think it does go hand in hand that the more information that people have, the more they can make the best use of their time,” McLaughlin said. “If the best use of your time is (visiting) a business across the street, whether it be a coffee shop or something of that nature, that’s a win-win for everyone.”
 More riders get on board

VPRA and its partners’ efforts to boost interest in trains statewide have led to an increase in ridership across all rail corridors in Virginia, including Ashland and Richmond in the central region of the state.
In July, Amtrak Virginia reached a milestone, welcoming 131,743 passengers, marking the highest ridership for that month and the second-highest overall since the state-supported service began in 2009. The record for the highest monthly ridership remains 136,433, set in December 2024.
The increase in ridership has benefitted the tourism industry, including businesses and local amenities.
“(The upgrades) represent a huge leap forward — technology and safety-wise — based on what we were dealing with, which was nothing except the best guess of our very gracious staff,” said Martha Miller, assistant town manager in Ashland. “So the town is incredibly excited to have these new displays.”

Miller said the town will need to find adequate parking during special events due to the increase in ridership.
In Richmond, Katherine O’Donnell, president and CEO of Richmond Region Tourism, applauded VPRA and Amtrak’s investment in the city, which she said will also help support tourism in the region.
“Whether guests are arriving for business or exploring our historic sites, having clear, real-time travel information ensures a welcoming and stress-free experience,” O’Donnell said in a statement to the Mercury. “Main Street Station and Ashland are important gateways into our community, and improvements like these reinforce the Richmond Region as a connected, accessible, and visitor-friendly destination.”
Novak has retired her trusty binoculars — given to her by her husband after she shared her previous method of trying to spot trains while helping passengers with mobility challenges or children — and will retire herself in October after 19 years at the visitor center. As a new era of train travel emerges, she reflected on the role they have played in Ashland’s culture.
“When I sit back and think about it, we were very intertwined with Amtrak,” Novak said. “It just happened that way because of so many people. On some days, we would have anywhere from 50 to 100 people come through here in one day. That’s a lot for a small town, and for us and a good portion of (visitors), it has something to do with the train.”

In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.










I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat


During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
Shock, sadness and resolve in the wake of arson attack on governor’s residence

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel)As the countdown to this fall’s high-stakes elections continues, advocates are calling on the next governor of Virginia and state lawmakers to continue efforts to protect the Chesapeake Bay from pollution and to work to fight climate change impacts for Virginians and wildlife.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF), an independent conservation organization, held a press conference last week to discuss ways they hope the next governor will ramp up efforts to protect the bay and continue programs that are already in place. The agency said this election comes at a pivotal time for Virginia, where federal shifts have led to major shakeups including lost flood mitigation and clean energy funding, as House of Delegates and gubernatorial candidates’ priorities take shape. 
“It’s also about making sure that we have drinking water that is clean and ensuring that clean streams and rivers are available for our kids to enjoy for years to come,” said CBF Virginia Executive Director Chris Moore. “It’s also important that we make sure through these efforts, that our homes and our businesses are protected from damaging floods and extreme weather events that are becoming more common here in the Chesapeake Bay region.”
They have put together a five-point action plan to preserve the natural resource that so many in the commonwealth depend on.
 Restoring and protecting waterways

The state of Virginia has been a part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed agreement for a decade. That agreement between states surrounding the bay aims to reduce the amount of pollution and sediment runoff in the bay, restore habitats for key species, adapt communities to be more climate resilient, and expand education around bay conservation.
One of the Bay Foundation’s recommendations is to make the pilot Pay-For-Outcomes Nonpoint Source Pollution Reduction grant program permanent. Businesses, nonprofits, individuals, or local governments could apply for grants to reduce the amount of nitrogen or phosphorus flowing into the watershed. An initial $20 million had been put toward the one-year program.
CBF also urges the protection and restoration of Virginia’s wetlands that have been steadily shrinking. Recent studies have shown that the state could lose up to 78% of its wetlands by the end of the century due to rising sea levels. Wetlands can be the first line of defense when it comes to storm surge and protecting habitats within the bay.
“That is an unsustainable path, and we have got to turn that trend around, so we are calling on the next administration to take bold action, both legislatively and in the budget to expand the restoration and creation of wetlands, living shorelines, and green spaces,” said Jay Ford, CBF Virginia policy manager.
 Becoming more climate resilient

Virginia faces serious threats from climate change ranging from extreme heat, flooding, powerful storms, and disease. Hampton Roads is especially susceptible to flooding dangers as sea levels rise and rain amounts increase. The next governor’s administration will undoubtedly need to address these issues when she takes office.
In a sit-down interview with the Mercury in August, Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger said she would return Virginia to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that had been bringing in funds to help with flooding mitigation and other resiliency projects.

Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears had agreed to an interview but canceled it less than an hour before it was scheduled to start, and has not responded to questions about her climate resilience plans or any queries for this story. She has publicly stated her support for the state’s removal from the RGGI program, saying it was an unjust tax on Virginians.
CBF states there should be more resources in place for homeowners to access to make their homes more resilient against flooding and heat. There are also existing agricultural programs to help farmers get grants to plant cover crops and other methods to aid in reducing land erosion that the organization would like to see continue.
“Virginia is simply not prepared for climate change, and the federal government is pulling back at a time we need to be leaning in. Our next governor will need to help us catch up and make Virginia a national leader on climate adaptation,” Ford said.
Earle-Sears has not clearly laid out an agenda for climate resiliency or flood mitigation, but she has remarked on her “all of the above” energy policy, which does include building out fossil fuel infrastructure as part of the plan.
 Safeguarding Virginia’s diverse landscape

Virginia boasts forestland, mountains, and coastal elements to its rich landscape. CBF would like the next governor and General Assembly to modernize the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. The law gives the Department of Environmental Quality the authority to review state and federal projects to ensure they are built in a manner that preserves water quality. The law was last amended in 2022.
“We’d like to see it include more stringent conditions for allowing building in or removal of the CBPA buffers in the future,” Ford said. “This is just a recognition of the changes that are coming with climate change as these waters continue to move further up the shoreline.”
As forestland and wetlands are impacted by climate change, the CBF also wants to see an expansion of programs to protect tree canopies while respecting local authority under the Dillon rule. 
 Invest in farmers

The General Assembly has continued to increase the amount of funding for a grant program that allows farmers to opt in to sustainable farming measures to cut down on pollutants. This year, $223 million was put into the program. Farmers can apply for up to $300,000 in cost-share funds to select from 60 different projects all aimed at protecting water quality in the bay.
“The Commonwealth should work with the farmers and a research community to identify and target pollution hotspots that are prone to discharging excess nutrients,” Ford said. “The water runs off the land differently, all over the place, and we have the great tools available to us now to know how we can best deploy these limited tax dollars and make sure Virginia’s getting the most bang for our buck.”
Spanberger served in the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and chaired the Conservation and Forestry subcommittee and is keen to continue that type of work in the commonwealth. 
“Abigail brought Virginia producers, business owners, and community leaders together to strengthen voluntary conservation programs. Abigail supports strengthening voluntary, state-level programs to help Virginia farmers and producers reduce runoff and improve water quality,” a spokesperson for the Spanberger campaign said.
 Hold polluters accountable

CBF said the next administration must take a serious step towards managing PFAS, or forever chemicals, and microplastics that pose a serious threat to the Chesapeake Bay and other waterways in the state. Amid federal rollbacks of policies aimed at reducing pollution and emissions, CBF said it is time for the state to step in and ramp up. 
A Spanberger spokesperson said she has met with the CBF and others about this and will “make sure conservation efforts are working as intended, and that businesses are following the law,” if she is elected. 
Ford said there has been wide support for clean water initiatives, however, many lawmakers and local governments have differing ideas on what they feel is the best way to manage water quality. He said their organization has struggled the most in making headway in the General Assembly around the management of PFAS.
“The longer answer is the devils in the details, and we need to make sure we get everyone swimming in the same direction on these items, and that’s why we’re trying to jump out early before we’ve had an election, before we know who our new governor (and) a new general assembly is, and really set a roadmap for them to follow over the next couple of years,” Ford said.

Kennedy Jr. is targeting the government’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, without which manufacturers might cease producing shots. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF  Health News)Dining under palm trees on a patio at Mar-a-Lago in December, President-elect Donald Trump reassured chief executives at pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Pfizer that anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wouldn’t be a radical choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I think he’s going to be much less radical than you would think,” Trump said later that month during a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort.
Eight months have passed, and Kennedy is intensifying his attacks on the vaccine system.
High on his list of targets: a federal vaccine compensation program that settles injury claims. His strategy could bankrupt or diminish the fund, some legal scholars and public health leaders say, saddling pharmaceutical companies with liability risks and costs that would compel them to stop making vaccines altogether.
“It’s a radical agenda,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “He’s using a bunch of different mechanisms and there really are no guardrails. People are going to catch on but it’s not going to be enough to stop the waves of deaths, and deaths of children.”
Kennedy has said changes to the U.S. vaccine system are needed because, he asserts without evidence, immunizations are linked to autism, neurotoxicity, allergies, and death. He is a leader of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, an informal campaign that eschews traditional medicine and espouses “medical freedom.” Many adherents oppose vaccines and believe they are unsafe despite scientific evidence to the contrary.
Kennedy has acknowledged he wants to reform the vaccine fund, known as the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, writing July 28 on the social platform X that “the VICP is broken, and I intend to fix it.” HHS is working with the Department of Justice to revamp the program, which shields drugmakers from most liability over injuries.
HHS didn’t respond to a request to speak with Kennedy, but agency officials said he isn’t opposed to immunizations.
“Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,” HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in an email.
Yet behind the scenes, Kennedy has been laying the groundwork to restrict the availability of widely used immunizations, according to people familiar with internal discussions who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak on the topic.
A multipronged strategy
The strategy began taking shape in the spring. The first step: Raise unfounded questions about the safety of vaccines. At a Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump that HHS was undertaking a massive study that would identify the cause of rising autism diagnoses by September.
Kennedy tasked David Geier, a researcher who’s repeated the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, to oversee the work, according to media reports.
Kennedy then doubled down by questioning the use of aluminum, which is added to many vaccines to help boost the immune response. He linked it to allergies at a July meeting of governors, even though a recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found no connection. He’s widely expected to ask a federal vaccine advisory committee to conduct a review.
The autism research and concerns about aluminum were early salvos in the push to go after the compensation fund, according to two of the people.
That fund provides money to people for injuries from vaccines and has paid out more than $5 billion since it was established in 1988, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Before filing a lawsuit in court, injured individuals bring their claims to the program’s nonjury vaccine court, which reviews evidence. The fund provides compensation from a small excise tax on vaccines.
Compensation is determined in part by a table maintained by HRSA and overseen by the HHS secretary. It lists each vaccine and associated injuries and encompasses routine vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are subject to the excise tax. The injuries include anaphylaxis and encephalitis. People who experience such injuries within a certain time after getting a specific vaccine can get money.
Kennedy wants to get autism or allergies added to that document, according to two people familiar with internal discussions and concerns raised publicly by some vaccine developers and former regulators. He could accomplish the goal if HHS-led research blames vaccines for autism, for example, or if a federal vaccine advisory panel recommends against aluminum in vaccines, according to some legal scholars.
“Given the rate of autism, if a lot of cases are brought, that could bankrupt the program,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law San Francisco.
If that were to happen, pharmaceutical companies could stop producing the immunizations, which don’t tend to be very profitable, rather than get entangled in drawn-out, expensive lawsuits from claimants who can’t get money because the federal vaccine injury fund has run dry, some legal experts and vaccine developers said.
“The compensation fund, if it’s gone, would impact decisions to proceed or not to proceed,” said David Dodd, president and CEO of GeoVax Labs, a biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies.
A federal vaccine advisory panel could also recommend against aluminum in shots, forcing drugmakers to make costly reformulations or exit the market.
Kennedy has placed people around him to execute the strategy. He’s pushed to get vaccine skeptics in decision-making positions at the CDC, which recommends vaccines, and the Food and Drug Administration, which approves them.
He also tapped leaders in the anti-vaccine movement to vet candidates for him.
The outcome has been regulatory and policy decisions that have winnowed vaccine access and development.
HHS this month said it was halting $500 million in grants and contracts for the development of mRNA vaccines, including an improved, more durable covid mRNA vaccine.
The federal government stopped recommending covid shots for healthy pregnant women and children, bypassing input from a vaccine advisory committee that traditionally would have weighed in.
And Kennedy reconstituted that committee with his own handpicked members, including vaccine skeptics, and removed the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and other industry groups that served as committee liaisons. The modified panel recommended against flu vaccines containing a preservative erroneously linked to autism.
The White House calls
Kennedy’s determination to keep vaccine skeptics in oversight positions played out in a deal he recently made with Trump and his staff, according to two people familiar with the situation. The arrangement came together on a Sunday night in July when Kennedy got a call from the White House.
The subject was Vinay Prasad, a top vaccine regulator at the FDA. He had recently touched off a wave of industry criticism for playing a role in the agency’s decision to ask biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics to halt shipments of a gene therapy over safety concerns.
Social media posts and conservative commentators whipped up a furor. Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur, said July 21 on X that Prasad should be fired and called him “a self-proclaimed progressive liberal and Bernie Sanders fanboy,” referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Congressional lawmakers began peppering the White House with questions.
The furor reached Trump, who wanted Prasad out, according to the people. But Kennedy was concerned about losing Prasad. He felt he needed a critic of immunizations overseeing vaccines at the agency.
So Kennedy struck a deal. Prasad would be asked to resign as head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccine products and biologics such as gene therapies. And the center would be divided into two operations, with Kennedy empowered to select the person overseeing vaccines.
Some public health leaders publicly shared details of the arrangement and raised concerns about its potential impact. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an Aug. 1 interview on CNBC that he thought it “would be very destructive to the agency.”
After leaving the agency in July, Prasad is now returning, though it is unclear if his role has changed.
Recently, Kennedy was sued by Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense. An anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, Children’s Health Defense is funding the suit, which claims Kennedy failed to launch a task force to study vaccine safety that it says is required to report findings to Congress. But Kennedy and his allies view the lawsuit as friendly, according to one person familiar with the matter, because it is seeking an outcome that he wants.
HHS on Aug. 14 announced it was reviving a federal panel, disbanded in 1998, to provide oversight of pediatric vaccines.
Kennedy’s work against vaccines has triggered unfriendly lawsuits too, including one brought by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other public health groups. His recent decision to halt funds for mRNA vaccine development yielded a swell of social media criticism.
“This is reckless. This is dangerous. This will cost lives. We must fight back,” Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said Aug. 5 on X.
“I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions – but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,” Jerome Adams, who was U.S. surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, said Aug. 5 on the same platform.
Kennedy and his backers remain undeterred. In a counterpunch, his supporters are launching an unprecedented public relations campaign to promote the HHS secretary, spurring speculation that he may be mulling a 2028 presidential run.
The nonprofit MAHA Action held a call in July to energize Kennedy supporters and initiated a six-figure ad campaign extolling Kennedy and Trump administration health initiatives.
“Make no mistake, this is a revolution that will change the face of public health policy,” Tony Lyons, president of MAHA Action, said in a statement. “Americans are demanding radical transparency and gold standard science.”

Comprehensive consumer privacy laws are taking effect in eight states this year. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center. Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Going to the polls with my parents as a kid is seared into my brain. It’s one of those New Hampshire kid memories that sticks with you: adults waiting in line and murmuring, bake sales with limitless banana bread, neighbors crossing out names with rulers.
It was probably 2004 when my mom discovered a discrepancy between her name on her license and her name on her voter registration. One included her middle name, which had been her maiden name before marrying my dad. The other didn’t.
So at (probably) 11, I learned the word “affidavit.” Since my mom’s identity couldn’t be fully documented on the spot — like countless voters on Election Day — she signed a legally-binding affidavit attesting to her name. She could (and did) follow up with the Secretary of State’s office with additional documents.
Plain old New Hampshire efficiency. The presumption was that my mom was a legitimate voter unless proven otherwise.
Not so anymore.
Our state has a new slate of voting laws that cut against the Granite State tradition of practical access. Had they been on the books 20 years ago, my mom probably wouldn’t have been able to vote that Election Day. Anyone with a similar story will want to head to their local clerk’s office now — or they may not be able to vote this election season.










Some call the passage of these laws “election integrity.” All I see is the government making it harder for people to vote – especially women, senior citizens, college students, immigrants, and folks with disabilities.


Before leaving office, Gov. Chris Sununu signed House Bill 1569, making New Hampshire the first state in the country to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. Now, name variations like my mom’s throw up barriers to the ballot. Even small shifts — dropping a middle name, hyphenating a surname, reverting to a maiden name — can block registration if names don’t match across required documents. 
No affidavit. No presumption of good faith. No trust in the voter — or in the local officials who used to help sort this out.
And absentee voters aren’t exempt. This past August, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed two bills — SB 218 and SB 287 — requiring absentee voters to submit the same documentation now required in person. That means every absentee registration must include proof of citizenship, age, New Hampshire residence, and identity. Oh, and every time you request a ballot, you have to include a copy of your ID. Or a notarized signature. Or go in person to your town clerk.
Some call the passage of these laws “election integrity.” All I see is the government making it harder for people to vote – especially women, senior citizens, college students, immigrants, and folks with disabilities.
Over the years, how many women — and even some men — have changed their names through marriage, divorce, or just because they felt like it? How many seniors were born at home or in rural places and never got a formal birth certificate? How many students have mismatched addresses after moving apartments between semesters?
How many seniors, people with disabilities, and rural neighbors who work hard hours vote absentee because it’s a lot simpler for them than waiting in line for an ambiguous amount of time on Election Day?
At least 96 voters already started seeing the consequences of these laws play out when they were turned away from the polls during town meeting season. We can only imagine how many more will be discouraged from participating altogether.
All of us on the reasonable side of the fence believe in election integrity. We believe in sensible audits and consequences for the (literally) 10 bad actors our state has flagged since 2020.
But democracy works best when more people participate, the rules are clear and fair, and leaders work for us — not interest groups funding ads about fraud no one can find.
Many of us already show photo ID at the polls. We already rely on a bipartisan, decentralized system run by people who live down the street. I’m one of those volunteers. If integrity is the goal, there are smarter ways to get there than by tripping up voters in a middle school gym.
So, what do we do?
First, don’t wait. If you need to register, start early. If you moved, changed your name, or you’re a student deciding where “home” is for voting, resolve those questions now. Don’t wait until Election Day. The Secretary of State’s website has official guidance and links to local clerk’s office. Use them. Your clerk can tell you when to come in, what your options are, and how to avoid last-minute surprises.
Second, let’s fix the policy. If we’re serious about access and trust, let’s pass laws that meet voters where they are.

Protect Election Day registration. It’s a tradition that boosts participation. Attempts to roll it back are a solution in search of a problem.
Expand early and absentee voting. Parents, shift workers, caregivers, and rural voters don’t need more red tape in their lives. They need flexibility.
Modernize election security. Paper ballots, risk-limiting audits, and strong cybersecurity make our elections safer — without making them harder.
Fix campaign finance. Voters deserve to know who’s paying for the megaphones.

These are the practical steps that lead to election integrity. And if you’re standing in the way, it’s worth asking whether your goal is about integrity — or control.
Participation and security are not enemies. When more eligible Granite Staters vote, and when we can all see and trust the system that counts those votes, confidence grows. When we throw up new barriers, tell people to compile the amount of documentation they would need for a mortgage closing, and call it “integrity,” trust shrinks.
For now, the voting laws on the books lack common sense. They would keep practical women like my mom from the polls.
But New Hampshire is at its best when we lead with common decency. So maybe, with enough of us pushing, we’ll remember what “Live Free or Die” really demands: a government that trusts its people and a democracy where every Granite Stater can raise their hand and say, “I’m here.”

(Photo by  Aaron Sutch/Solar United Neighbors)Could an innovative energy project bringing light and hope to Puerto Rico also illuminate the Old Dominion?
Back in 2017, a hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico’s power grid. The island struggled to rebuild it, with limited success, and continues to experience a severe electricity shortage and frequent power outages. Customers and nonprofits have stepped into the void, installing solar panels on rooftops all over the island and backing them up with batteries. Today, 175,000 households have solar — about 1 in 7  – and at least 160,000 of those also have battery backup. Thousands of new installations go in every month.
The solar and batteries don’t just secure electricity for the customers who install them. Through programs like one managed by the solar company Sunrun, Puerto Rico’s grid can draw on the batteries to provide power in times of emergency, reducing the frequency and duration of power outages for everyone. 
Last month, as hurricane season got underway again, Puerto Rico’s grid operator announced it had reached a “major energy milestone.” In a statement posted on X, LUMA Energy said it “successfully dispatched approximately 70,000 batteries, contributing around 48 MW of energy to the grid.” That’s about as much as a gas peaker plant, with no need for fuel.
Puerto Rico’s experience shows how residents and businesses no longer need to be passive energy consumers. With a well-designed program they can play an active role in keeping the lights on in their communities, and get paid for it. 
This customer participation creates what is called a “virtual power plant” (VPP), sometimes also called a community power plant. The VPP may use battery aggregation, as in Puerto Rico, or demand reduction measures like temporary adjustments to smart thermostats or shifting electric vehicle charging to off-peak times. The more these measures are combined, the bigger the benefit to the grid, and the less a utility needs to invest in new generation to meet peaks in demand.

VPPs offer such promise that this year Virginia’s General Assembly directed Dominion Energy to develop a pilot program for its customers, to be overseen by the State Corporation Commission. 
HB2346, from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, calls for a program of up to 450 MW to “optimize demand” with distributed energy resources, mainly batteries but also smart thermostats, electric vehicle charging and non-battery storage (e.g., electric hot water heaters). The proposal, due to be filed with the SCC by December 1, must include incentives for at least 15 MW of residential batteries. The legislation calls for stakeholder participation in the development of the VPP, with opportunities for public input. 
Dominion is also tasked with expanding the electric school bus program it began in 2019, which allows the utility to make use of school bus batteries at times of the day when the buses are not needed to transport children. As of March of 2024, Dominion had 135 electric buses in the program, spread across 25 school districts in Virginia. 
The impact of VPPs can be significant. This summer, California’s grid operator conducted an experiment to determine how much customer batteries could contribute to the needs of the grid. More than 100,000 residential batteries across California delivered an average of 535 MW of power from 7 to 9 p.m. on July 29, an output equivalent to that of a coal plant. 
Many other states are also using VPPs. Some are limited to solar-powered battery aggregation, like Xcel’s Colorado program and a new Texas program, while others involve demand response programs using smart appliances – anything that can be turned off and on remotely for short periods. In Michigan, DTE pays electric vehicle owners to charge at off-peak times, while Arizona Public Service’s VPP pays customers for the ability to access their smart thermostats to reduce peak demand.
Vermont’s Green Mountain Power runs two popular battery programs, one for people who own their own batteries and the other that leases batteries to customers. Both allow the utility to draw on the batteries when the power grid requires more capacity. 
While Virginia has not had a VPP program before, appliance-based demand response will be familiar to residents who opted into Dominion Energy’s “Smart Cooling Rewards” program.  Participants allowed the utility to remotely turn their air conditioners on and off for a few minutes at a time on hot days in exchange for an annual $40 payment. This helped the utility shave peak demand without affecting residents’ comfort. 
Dominion ended the cooling rewards program in 2022 and now offers a “Peak Time Rebate” program that rewards customers for reducing energy use during certain times of high energy demand. This program, however, requires residents to take affirmative measures themselves, like adjusting thermostats and delaying laundry. A well-designed VPP program, by contrast, takes the burden off the individual.
Josephus Allmond, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center who helped to craft the Virginia VPP legislation, told me in an email that he expects school buses and smart thermostats will make up most of Dominion’s program initially, but he’d like to see the residential battery component grow significantly from the initial 15 MW. Even 100,000 aggregated residential batteries would be a minor share of Dominion’s 2.8 million residential accounts, he pointed out.
I emailed Nathan Frost, Dominion’s general manager for new business and customer solutions, to ask for more information about the VPP program. Frost replied only that Dominion is “actively developing our VPP framework and will be engaging stakeholders soon.”    
Stakeholders, including customers themselves, are likely to have a lot to say. Clean energy advocates have long urged that VPPs, distributed generation sources and microgrids can contribute to a more efficient, secure and resilient grid, at less cost to everyone. 
No doubt recentering the grid around customers is too tall an order for a monopoly utility with a profit model based on centralized generation. But from what we’ve seen in Puerto Rico, California and elsewhere, harnessing even some of the power of customer-owned resources is a worthwhile project whose time has finally come.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)For more than thirty years, Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, has navigated Virginia politics with a simple motto: “Be nice.” The Republican, who was elected minority leader by his caucus in May, keeps a copy of the credo on his desk on the House floor and embodies it as he roams the halls of the Capitol, dishing out grins in the depths of February budget battles.
Politically, Kilgore’s amiability translates into a willingness to cut deals.
To help Southwest Virginia’s economy, he has embraced projects that are controversial within his own party and constituents, including Medicaid expansion, the legalization of casino gambling and a regional hospital monopoly. 
Kilgore declined an interview for this story. But in two interviews last year, he laid out a vision of politics built around compromise.
“If you get 60-70% of what you want, that’s a win,” Kilgore said in July 2024. “A lot of folks don’t see it that way.”
Kilgore’s deals sometimes benefit his donors, his family and himself. He’s sponsored bills that benefit his twin brother Jerry Kilgore’s lobbying clients and helped appoint allies to the local judicial bench. In 2018, his colleagues roasted him with an “Overdog Award,” complete with a trophy overflowing with campaign cash, for driving legislation that allowed Dominion Energy, his largest donor, to keep hundreds of millions in excess profits.

Kilgore’s new role as the top Republican in the House of Delegates means he’ll have to strike his toughest deal yet in this November’s elections: convincing swing voters to trust the GOP against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s continued unpopularity in the commonwealth. Kilgore is no personal danger in his ruby red district but he needs to help Republican candidates  flip two swing seats to retake the House majority. They’re seen as an underdog, with GOP gubernatorial hopeful Winsome Earle-Sears trailing Democrat Abigail Spanberger by 7% among likely voters in a recent poll from Roanoke College.
Kilgore’s job won’t be any easier in January, when the legislature convenes. The bipartisanship he championed for years has been strained by increasingly bitter battles over abortion, guns and surging energy demand. An increasing number of Democrats and some Republicans have taken a critical view of powerful special interests like Dominion Energy. 
Still, Chris Saxman, a former Republican delegate who served with Kilgore from 2002 to 2010 who now heads the pro-business advocacy group Virginia Free, said Kilgore was a “very skilled operator” who would pick his battles strategically.
“People confuse nice with weakness, and one should never do that with Terry Kilgore,” Saxman said.
 The Dealmaker

Kilgore’s politics are at least partly explained by his background in Scott County, on the Tennessee border.
Shaped by isolation from Richmond — parts of the region are closer to seven other states’ capitals — Southwest Virginia defies easy political categorization. The region elected one of the two first women to serve in the General Assembly in 1923 and sometimes elected Republicans during Democratic Byrd Machine’s dominance in the early 20th century.
Regional lawmakers from both parties learned to band together in farflung Richmond, according to Duane Miller, the longtime head of the LENOWISCO Planning District Commission, which coordinates economic development projects. Southwest Virginia’s small political presence at the statehouse — diminished further by population losses driven by the decline of coal — made bipartisan cooperation essential to winning state attention to the region’s needs, Miller said.
“Whether Richmond is a Democrat majority or a conservative majority, in Southwest Virginia, you have to be able to relate and get along with everybody because we have fewer voices,” Miller said.

Kilgore’s 1993 election to the House of Delegates made him the first Republican to represent the district since at least 1947. He found early ways to make his mark. Working with Jerry Kilgore, who served at the time as Gov. George Allen’s secretary of public safety, the brothers helped bring two high security prisons in the region that are now major employers. 
Even as Jerry lost the 2005 gubernatorial contest to Democrat Tim Kaine, Terry rose through the ranks of the House Republican majority, eventually assuming the chair of the powerful Commerce and Labor Committee and the Virginia Tobacco Commission. The commission helped bring broadband to Appalachian hollers, funded scholarships and helped set up Lincoln Memorial University’s veterinary school, the largest private vet school in the U.S.
Kilgore sidestepped pressure to run for Congress and turned down a federal judgeship. As a delegate, he felt he could do more for Southwest Virginia than he would on the bench or in Congress.
“I sort of got into a niche here,” Kilgore said.
 The Virginia Way

To Kilgore’s critics, that niche became a little too cozy — emblematic of “The Virginia Way.” The phrase has sometimes been invoked proudly, to describe a form of political civility and pro-business legislative consensus in Virginia. But Jeff Thomas, author of “The Virginia Way: Democracy and Power after 2016,” argues that Virginia lawmakers have regularly prioritized donors’ interests over constituents, enabled by the commonwealth’s nearly unfettered campaign finance laws and lax ethics rules.
“I think that [Kilgore] embodies a lot of what’s wrong about Virginia politics,” Thomas said.
Kilgore’s deep ties to major donors, particularly Dominion Energy, have been a consistent theme in his career. As chair of the Virginia Tobacco Commission, Kilgore and commission members sent $30 million in economic development funds from 2012 to 2014 to help build a pipeline fueling a Dominion plant. VTC’s own funding formulas called for giving less than a quarter of that amount. 
Kilgore also backed a $1.8 billion coal-fired power plant in Wise County that Dominion completed in 2012, over the objections of environmentalists who said it was unnecessary. In 2020, with Democrats aiming to quickly retire a plant that operated at 22% of its capacity in 2019, Kilgore struck a deal with the party to delay the plant’s closure — a move he said was necessary to fund local government services. In exchange, he was the only House Republican to vote for the sweeping Virginia Clean Economy Act, a Democratic priority aimed at decarbonizing the electric grid by 2050. 
At some points, Kilgore’s legislative causes have overlapped with his brother Jerry’s lobbying clients. Terry Kilgore sponsored 2024 legislation aimed at legalizing gaming terminals at convenience stores. Jerry Kilgore’s lobbying clients included Pace-O-Matic, a key driver of the bill and, through an affiliated industry group, Del. Kilgore’s second largest donor last year. 
When one of Jerry Kilgore’s clients and Del. Kilgore’s donors, Mountain State Health Alliance, wanted to advance a merger with a rival hospital system, Terry Kilgore sponsored 2015 legislation allowing the change and led public hearings before it was ultimately approved by the state health commissioner in 2017, over the objections of federal regulators. The resulting company, Ballad Health, has drawn criticism for failing to meet many of the benchmarks set by regulators. Nonetheless, state regulatory filings show Jerry Kilgore, who has continued to lobby for Ballad, unsuccessfully pushed for reduced state oversight of the company as recently as 2023. 
The delegate said he and his brother “don’t always agree on everything” and noted Ballad made good on its promises to re-open a shuttered Lee County hospital.
Arguably the biggest nexus for Kilgore’s regional political clout is his law firm, headquartered out of a sturdy former bank in downtown Gate City.

Across the street at the Scott County Court, Kilgore argues cases in front of judges whom he helped appoint. In Virginia, local delegations of lawmakers pick local judges in a largely closed-door process. Kilgore and other practicing lawyer-lawmakers have an unusual relationship with the bench, who hear their cases and require lawmakers’ support to retain their job.
Southwest Virginia’s judgeships are stocked with people Kilgore knows well, including his former officemate, two former associates who worked for his firm and a former colleague in the House Republican caucus. 
Given the many factors that go into court cases, it’s difficult to definitively determine whether those ties have given Kilgore’s clients a leg up. Kilgore said he “gets basically what everyone else gets” when it comes to legal outcomes. 
But the appointment process has presented other opportunities. In 2021, Kilgore and other local lawmakers appointed Scott County’s top prosecutor to the bench. Kilgore’s son, Kyle Kilgore, who’d finished law school two years before, ran for the vacant commonwealth’s attorney seat and won an uncontested race.
In 2023, local lawmakers appointed their colleague, then-delegate Jeff Campbell, to the bench. Kilgore subsequently purchased Campbell’s law firm. The move allowed Kilgore to pick up Campbell’s clients and, together with a merger with a law firm in Blacksburg, expand the reach of his practice to become among the region’s largest.
Kilgore’s legal clients have sometimes had a distinctly political tint.
When China Machinery Engineering Corp. of Beijing sought to build an arena in Virginia Beach in 2013, they hired Terry Kilgore, who lived a seven-hour drive away, as an attorney — news first reported by the defunct news site watchdog.org, which said Kilgore signed a contract with the company worth $1.2 million. 
Kilgore said that the true total was “nowhere close” to that amount. The attorney said that he’d been brought on to the project because his firm “knew some people who knew some people” in Virginia Beach but that his work on the project, which never got off the ground, had been limited.
More recently, Kilgore has provided legal representation to Clyde Stacy, a local coal mining magnate whose 2023 plan to bring a private landfill to Russell County generated a groundswell of local opposition. 
As the plan was being considered by the county’s board of supervisors, Kilgore became the board’s attorney, and in at least one case, attempted to squelch criticism of the project, leading some activists to accuse him of having a conflict of interest. Kilgore said he’d recused himself from all landfill business.

 A purple state battleground

Kilgore’s new position may bring more scrutiny to future deals. But his immediate task is to raise lots of money and help swing-district Republicans win tough suburban races.
It’s not going to be easy. In last year’s presidential elections, Kamala Harris carried 59 of the state’s 100 House districts, according to an analysis from the Virginia Public Access Project. The Roanoke College poll found 56% of Virginia residents disapproved of Trump’s job as president.
In Kilgore’s view, Virginia’s political landscape has changed since Trump’s first term, when Republicans lost control of the House for the first time in over 20 years.
“President Trump’s doing a lot better,” Kilgore told conservative talk show host John Fredericks in July. “Our economy’s just running on all cylinders right now.”
Kilgore has never come across as a MAGA diehard. But how he handles Trump’s policies — the tariffs, the cuts to Medicaid, the immigration raids, the firing of federal workers — may help define his legacy.
For Democrats like Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, who spent decades working alongside Kilgore, it can be difficult to square the Republican’s personal warmth with Trump’s politics. She said Kilgore’s new position means he’ll be asked to own the president’s policies or risk provoking his caucus and the White House.
“My bet is that the Terry that I’ve seen for so long will not change into the aggressive partisan spokesman,” she said. “The issue is whether or not the Republican House caucus is going to be satisfied with what’s in front of the camera.”
It’s also not clear how long Kilgore will want the job. The Republican is the first to admit he is in the twilight of his political career. 
“I can’t do it too much longer,” he said in a July, 2024 interview.
For now, Kilgore’s Subaru Crosstrek is criss-crossing the state, hitting fundraisers from Chesapeake to Harrisonburg. Saxman, the former delegate, said Kilgore was one of a handful of politicians he knows who seemed to genuinely enjoy politics.
“They have this glint in their eye,” Saxman said. “They just love what they do and they’re really good at it and the people around them really like them, too.”

The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.

For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Photo courtesy of LifeWise Academy)In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
Identical bill language
The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
Public schools would be required to allow dismissal for religious instruction under new bill

ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
Ten Commandment displays
Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.











This is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment.

After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

(Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s cuts to CDC funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis.
Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.
Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.

The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
The money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.
In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”
Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
Aston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
The Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.
The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”
Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.
Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.
The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.



 Methodology

KFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.
This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

Burt Jones at the kickoff for his campaign for governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhy should GOP primary voters vote for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones to be Georgia’s next governor over Attorney General Chris Carr or another candidate who may emerge between now and May’s party primary?
For several speakers at Jones’ official campaign kick-off in Flovilla last week, Jones’ loyalty to President Donald Trump shows he is the right person for the job. Jones – who celebrated receiving Trump’s endorsement last month – is so loyal to the president that he tried to help Trump win the 2020 election even after he already lost it, said now-U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach.
Five years and multiple investigations and court cases later, nobody has been charged with rigging the 2020 election in Georgia or any other state.
 U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“We saw boxes being stuffed,” Beach said. “We saw all this, and we got all these complaints, and so we started asking questions. And we wanted a special session, we wanted to get down to the bottom of it, and that’s when I learned this man has backbone and courage. And I will tell you, we both got punished. We lost our chairmanships, but we never wavered. He never wavered.”
Jones and Beach, both state senators at the time, were stripped of leadership positions after they joined calls to overturn Trump’s loss in Georgia, punishment from then-Republican, then-Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.
At the Flovilla rally, Jones and his allies wore that punishment like a badge of honor.
“In 2020, when President Trump needed allies, these politicians were silent,” said Sen. Greg Dolezal, referring to what he characterized as fair weather MAGA fans. “When Fani Willis weaponized her office and tried to take Trump down, these politicians were nowhere to be found. And even when Donald J. Trump was our nominee to beat Joe Biden, these politicians wouldn’t even say his name. This is what I call political appropriation. These politicians want a ticket on the Trump train, but they never paid the price. Let me tell you something, Burt Jones paid the price with blood, sweat and tears.”
Jones also became a potential target of the Fulton County election interference case for his role serving as one of the GOP alternate electors for Trump. But a special prosecutor concluded last year that criminal charges should not be brought against him. That case has stalled since Trump returned to the White House.
To pivot or not to pivot?
But while that pro-Trump rhetoric may play well with GOP primary voters, , a more moderate general electorate could find the Trump fealty more of a turnoff, said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie.
 Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“The challenge with the median voter as it relates to primaries and general elections is that what’s necessary to win a primary election could possibly be a liability if you go too far in a general election because the electorate changes and the median voter is going to be more ideologically moderate in a general than in a primary,” she said. “So the question is, do you make promises in a primary election that make you look unprincipled or equivocating in a general election context?”
“If, all of a sudden, he became a Brian Kemp, Chamber of Commerce kind of Republican, it would come off as inauthentic, and risk losing the MAGA base,” she added.
Jones and his allies may be calculating that Jones can avoid the usual political dance to one side during a primary then back to the center during the general.
“So the thing that whoever the Republican nominee has in their favor is there are still more Republicans in the state than Democrats,” Gillespie said. “And so given the fact that the fundamentals of the state privilege Republicans, what he’s banking on is not having to pivot that much. That could be helped or hindered by the strength of the Democratic Party organization going into this election.”
Gillespie said whether the Democratic nominee is former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves or former DeKalb CEO Michael Thurmond, their campaign will likely run ads attacking Jones for his 2020 election interference, should he become the nominee.
“But I think the question is, is that going to be enough to persuade Democratic voters, particularly ones who don’t show up regularly in statewide elections to turn out and vote? I think what Burt Jones or Chris Carr would be banking on is that that’s a tall order, a huge task for Democrats to do, given their numerical disadvantage.”
Be like Kemp
 Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Kennesaw State University political science professor and former Cobb County GOP chairman Jason Shepherd said courting voters who still believe in widespread 2020 voter fraud could be a dangerous endeavor.
“Burt Jones needs to thread the needle very carefully,” he said. “I mean, the activist class is still very much focused on 2020, but the activist class within the party as a whole is only 1% of the primary electorate. On top of that, he doesn’t have the entire activist class. So you’re talking about appealing to only about one half of 1%.”
Trump endorsements aren’t quite as hefty as they may be in other states, Shepherd added, referring to the 2022 primary in which most of Trump’s Georgia endorsees fell flat.
That year, Carr fended off the Trump-endorsed John Gordon with nearly three quarters of the vote and Kemp slapped away a challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, who was enlisted by the former president to dethrone Kemp, with a similar margin.
“Brian Kemp really set the example,” Shepherd said. “Brian Kemp ran a campaign about what he had done in his first four years as governor and didn’t focus on the Trump administration at all. In fact, he more or less ignored Trump’s attacks. Given the opportunity, he would say complimentary things about Donald Trump, just sort of agree to disagree. And I think that shows the path forward.”
In a statement, the Carr campaign indicated they may use a similar approach next year.
“In 2020 and in 2022, Chris Carr proudly stood by Governor Kemp,” said Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone. “The Governor and Chris Carr received 75% of the vote in the Republican Primary in 2022 because Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed their style of conservative leadership.”

A fading level of safety-net supports for veterans could have consequences when it comes to recruiting new service members, according to a former surgeon general for the U.S. Navy.
While active and former members of the military may have access to care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), some may not know about it, and some may not be eligible for care in the same way they are eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, 1.7 million veterans rely on Medicaid in the U.S.
Dr. Forrest Faison, who led the medical and health care systems for the U.S. Navy as surgeon general until 2019, said the group of veterans who rely on Medicaid “tends to be these high-need, very vulnerable populations.”
Faison is now provost and senior vice president of academic affairs at Northeast Ohio Medical University.
Coverage through the VA depends on a “disability rating,” according to Faison, which is determined based on your years of service, service-related injuries and other factors. For some that are severely disabled after leaving the service, the VA provides full-service benefits. For others, less coverage is available.
The veteran Medicaid population, which amounts to about 10% of the entire veteran population, uses the program for mental health, housing and other services they may not be able to receive through the VA system.
“There are also veterans that don’t have a very high disability rating, but are nonetheless veterans, who may depend on Medicaid because of job issues, disability, PTSD, things like that,” Faison said.
Ohio will see a $33 billion decrease in federal Medicaid spending over the next ten years, part of the $911 billion in total Medicaid cuts across the country for the next decade, according to estimates from health policy research organization KFF.
 Source: KFF
The reductions come at a time when more members of the military than ever are coming back from conflict, which Faison called “high combat survival.”
“We’re routinely saving men and women who would have died in any previous conflict,” Faison said, meaning the support for these men and women’s health care should be improving, rather than being cut.
  Where will the cuts come from? 
One thing the federal budget bill didn’t do was reduce the federal match Ohio receives from its current 90%, meaning the state’s Medicaid expansion group is still in place. The state operating budget included language that would have eliminated the group if the federal match went down even 1%.
The estimated losses would come the implementation of work requirements in the federal bill, which imposes new requirements on those aged 19 to 64 who are in the Medicaid expansion population, with exemptions for things such as medical conditions or individuals with young children.
“Previous evidence suggests that work requirements may cause many Ohioans to lose their insurance, even if they are employed or have a condition that exempts them from new requirements,” the Health Policy Institute of Ohio said in an analysis of the federal budget bill. “While the exact impact of these requirements will differ depending on upcoming federal guidance and state decisions, existing analyses based on Ohio’s submitted work requirements waiver suggest that up to 200,000 Ohioans could lose coverage.”
Other losses could come from taxes on medical providers, which states like Ohio use to create revenue for their Medicaid programs. These can include Medicaid managed care plans, commercial health insurers, nursing homes and hospitals. The Health Policy Institute of Ohio said restrictions included in the federal bill “will result in significant Medicaid funding shortfalls for Ohio.”
The state’s Medicaid department itself saw a drop in funding from the state operating budget, amounting to $93.7 million in fiscal year 2026 and $650 million in 2027, when compared to the executive budget proposed by Gov. Mike DeWine.
“Unless the state finds new revenue sources, Ohio will need to cut billions of dollars of annual Medicaid spending in the coming years,” the institute’s analysis stated.
The institute said “primary ways” in which the department could lower spending would be in the areas of provider reimbursement rates, covered services or eligibility groups, including Medicaid expansion.
Ohio veterans on Medicaid
It’s hard to tell how many veterans this might impact specifically, because while the application for Medicaid includes a box to note one’s veteran status, checking the box is optional, according to a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid. The think tank Policy Matters Ohio noted that from 2021 to 2023, 1 in 10 Ohio veterans were enrolled in Medicaid and/or had a family member in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
Policy Matters Ohio researcher Heather Smith said in an August brief that the federal budget bill would not only cut Medicaid funding for veterans, but also implement workforce reductions at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs locations.
“Medicaid is crucial to filling health coverage gaps for many veterans, especially those who have low income or are unable to prove service-connected disabilities,” Smith wrote, adding that nearly half of veterans covered by Medicaid have reported a disability.

This redetermination process would occur twice a year instead of once per year, leading to an increase in administrative load along with extra work for those eligible for coverage. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, previous experience has shown that “people who still meet eligibility criteria will lose coverage and ‘churn’ on and off Medicaid, leading to interruptions in people’s medications and treatments.”
  ‘We have no plan’ 
The struggles that veterans may face in getting proper medical care and other services after they’ve come home from service reflects back to a country of young people who are debating service themselves, and the parents who want to make sure they remain as safe as possible.
“What we found and continue to find … is our recruiting and our ability to retain the force necessary to defend and protect us … depends on how well it’s perceived by others that we take care of our active duty and then from that, our veterans,” Faison said.
In his days as surgeon general of the Navy, Faison frequently asked leaders about a national strategy to help veterans, wounded or not, and how the country would support the future of the military through its care for those in uniform. He asked as military members came back from Iraq and Afghanistan, and as cuts to parts of the military care system kept coming in order to pay for other needs within the government.
“I asked these questions all four years I was surgeon general, and no one could answer those questions,” Faison said. “Which told me we have no plan.”
The Ohio Department of Veterans Services endeavors to get those who are eligible for VA services transitioned from Medicaid to VA care. The program “supports veterans with service-connected disabilities who are in long-term care,” according to the state Department of Veterans Services.
Since 2013, the Veterans On Medicaid program has “helped more than 75 veterans secure VA benefits and transition from Medicaid, allowing them to retain their VA pension or compensation while receiving comprehensive VA health care,” according to a spokesperson for the department.
The voluntary Veterans On Medicaid program is free for veterans, with outreach staff who help find placement at VA locations or other proper facilities.
Ohio has five VA medical facilities, located in Cleveland, Columbus, Chillicothe, Cincinnati and Dayton. The locations can mean struggles for veterans who are rural residents, which isn’t a small amount, according to Faison.
“A lot of these veterans, especially in Ohio, live in rural areas, where even if you’ve got some benefits, you may not have the services available,” he said.
Medicaid “was seen as a safety net” for those Faison knew who couldn’t readily access or didn’t know about their eligibility for VA coverage.
So as the federal government looks to make cuts to that safety net, the consequences have to be considered, he said. Those consequences aren’t only in quality medical care, but also in housing, food security and employment for veterans after their service. Consequences that could mean less interest in serving for fear of a lack of support afterward.
“Every mom and dad in America is looking at how well we take care of these folks to help influence whether their son or daughter puts on the uniform and serves our nation to protect us,” Faison said. “So there’s a lot riding on that.”

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act on access to care for millions of Americans. 
Nearly two months after the law’s passage, hospital executives here say there are critical details still unknown that make it difficult to determine exactly how it will impact providers and patients.
“My best guess is it’s not going to be good for hospital providers and health care in general,” Vincent Capece, president and CEO of Middlesex Hospital, an independent hospital located in Middletown, CT. “There’s going to be less money available, but exactly how much and how that all works out when the dust settles is really hard to calculate.”
The law makes several changes to Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, that are projected to kick anywhere from 100,000 to 170,000 residents off the program in the next decade. It also impose new limits on the amount of Medicaid funding states can collect from the federal government through what’s known as the “hospital provider tax.” 
Those are just some of the policies that could spell trouble for a hospital’s bottom line.  
Health care researchers predict the law’s major components, some of which aren’t slated for implementation until 2027 at the earliest, will pose the greatest challenge to rural hospitals and those that serve a large share of Medicaid patients. Hospitals that aren’t performing well financially might also be less poised to absorb potential revenue hits that the law’s measures could bring. 
The Connecticut Mirror spoke with hospital executives from around the state about how they’re approaching major pending federal changes. 
It’s too early to consider service cuts, in most cases
Most of the hospital leaders who spoke for this article said it’s still too early to consider scaling back services in response to the federal cuts. 
Ben Wade, chief strategy officer at Stamford Health, said he’s hopeful they’ll be able to manage costs without reducing access to services. 
“We have not identified any programs at this time for closure,” Wade said. “We don’t plan to do that.”
However, leaders at small community and rural hospitals acknowledged that they may have to scale back the availability of certain services.

“It’s not necessarily cutting programs,” Kurt Barwis, CEO of Bristol Hospital, said. “It’s starting to look critically and strategically at ‘How do I retool these programs to accomplish the same thing but at a lower cost?’”
Barwis said he’s established partnerships with larger hospital systems, like UConn Health and Hartford HealthCare, and expects to do more of these in the future.
Kyle Kramer, CEO of Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, said service changes are “inevitable” at rural community hospitals like his, where they must always think about whether there is enough demand for a particular service, he said. 
“There has to be a high enough level of volume to maintain that proficiency,” Kramer said. “And if it becomes a service that is too expensive to offer, we’ve got to think about, ‘Okay, is this something that we should partner with somebody else who has larger scale to provide it?’”
People with commercial insurance may feel impacts to cost, access
While the federal changes directly impact people who get coverage through Medicaid and state-based exchanges, the ripple effects will be felt by everyone, health care leaders warned.
“The impact goes far beyond those who lose coverage. Our entire health system and every community we serve will feel the effects. Reduced services, longer wait times, staff reductions, and the potential closure of programs and facilities,” Daniel Keenan, vice president of government relations at Trinity Health of New England, stated in emailed comments.
Keenan pointed to emergency rooms as an example. When people don’t have coverage, they turn to emergency departments for basic care, resulting in crowding, service delays and staffing issues that impact the entire system, he said.
The changes could drive up costs for people with private insurance, as well. 
Leaders at both Stamford and Middlesex hospitals say the reductions in government Medicaid payments will likely force them to negotiate increased payments from commercial insurers, which could result in higher premiums for those with private coverage.
“We will need to think about the upcoming commercial insurance negotiations that we have to make sure that we have the resources that we need to cover our expenses,” Wade said, adding that if insurers and employers don’t opt to absorb these costs, they will end up hitting people’s premiums. 
Provider tax changes could deal the biggest financial blow
One of the big areas of uncertainty lies with the hospital provider tax, several hospital executives said. The provider tax is an arrangement that allows states to increase the amount of federal Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government by collecting taxes from hospitals and then redistributing those funds back to the facilities. The exchange counts as Medicaid spending by states and entitles them to extra reimbursements from Washington. 
The federal budget bill decreases the “safe harbor limit” — or the rate at which states can tax hospitals — from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, with a phased-in reduction beginning in 2028.
Even though the new limit won’t take effect for several years, federal waivers for the tax rate will pose an issue as soon as next year, when the current provider tax agreement between the state and hospitals expires. In advance of a new agreement, approved by the legislature this year and slated to take effect in July 2026, Connecticut will have to reapply for a federal waiver to tax the hospitals above the safe harbor limit in order to go ahead with its plan to increase hospital taxes by $375 million. 
In the past, states have been permitted to apply for waivers to tax hospitals at rates exceeding the safe harbor limit. Connecticut, for example, taxes hospitals at the maximum 6% for inpatient revenues, but received a federal waiver to tax outpatient revenues at slightly over 10%, said Paul Kidwell, senior vice president at the Connecticut Hospital Association. It’s unclear whether the federal government will continue to grant such waivers, he added.
“It’s a big question mark,” Kidwell said. “We’re proceeding as if we can continue, with the knowledge that we need more information from CMS in order to be certain.” 
Capece, CEO at Middlesex Hospital, said the tax change could be the biggest financial disruptor for his hospital, even more so than changes to Medicaid eligibility. 
“The risk really lies with regard to the provider tax issue,” Capece said. “It’s a huge amount of money.”
Barwis, of Bristol Hospital, called the expiration of the agreement at the end of this fiscal year a looming “day of reckoning” for Connecticut.
“Will [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] grant a new waiver to keep it at 10.5%? Or will CMS say, ‘No, no, no, we’re not going to grant this waiver again. You need to go down to 6%.’ And how will that affect hospitals in the state of Connecticut?” Barwis said. 
Some think there’s still hope for change
At least some Connecticut hospital leaders hope the most potentially damaging effects of the bill could get scaled back or repealed before they go into effect. 
Wade, who oversees strategy at Stamford Health, said there’s a chance that, if Democrats take control of Congress in the midterm elections, some of the changes could be “pushed off or unwound entirely,” he said. 
“We’re still doing a lot of advocacy at the federal level because this is still a moving target,” Wade said.
Kramer, who heads up Day Kimball, agreed that there’s still time for things to change. Capece from Middlesex said he, too, is “cautiously optimistic.” 
CHA’s Kidwell is less convinced the law could be scaled back but, he said, he’s grateful to be facing these federal changes in a state that wants to help as many people as possible keep their health coverage.
“We all have this goal of making sure as many people stay insured as possible and that compliance with federal rules is not so onerous that people fall off because of paperwork,” Kidwell said. “I don’t think that’s the same in other states where they might have a different motivation.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stamford-Hospital-exterior02-e1625253338482.jpg,,,2025-09-02 05:56:59.130617

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)CANTON, Ohio – About 200 Canton residents gathered at a Plumbers and Pipefitters union hall Tuesday to hear from Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes. The Akron native represents Ohio’s 13th congressional district, covering all of Summit County and the Northwest portion of Stark County including Canton.
But Sykes told the crowd that might change. Later this year Ohio state lawmakers have to redraw the state’s congressional map because the previous version passed along party lines. As the Trump administration pushes states like Texas and Indiana to come up with more Republican-friendly districts, Sykes knows she has a target on her back.
“I have always been the apple of the eye of the Republicans in this congressional seat,” she said in an interview, noting the past two elections in the 13th district have cost almost $50 million.
“There’s no reason for me to think that all of a sudden, in 2026 they’ve decided they don’t care about Ohio 13,” Sykes said.
Because she and Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Toledo represent toss-up seats, they’re likely to be the first places Republican mapmakers look to improve their party’s chances.

Sykes worries about what that could mean for communities like Canton and Akron. Under the previous map, both cities were split and a total of five different lawmakers represented parts of the current district.
“None of them lived in this area,” Sykes said. “This district was the outskirts of all of their districts, so we got what was left over in terms of their time, their attention, the resources they were willing to send here, and it showed.”
Getting to know you
Sykes told attendees about anti-corruption legislation she’s working on and the committees on which she serves. The bill redefines an “official act” to make it harder for government officials to accept gifts; her seat on the Science, Space and Technology Committee helped Akron land a tech hub and gives her an oversight role with the massive Intel project in Licking County.
VP Vance visits Ohio to tout the Trump/Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Sykes also pushed back on Vice President JD Vance characterizing Akron and Canton as “lawless” during a recent visit nearby. She criticized the Trump administration for pausing community policing and nonprofit security grants and “holding them hostage in D.C.”
She also brought up the flood of money that has poured into her last two races to set up a presentation from End Citizens United President Tiffany Muller. That U.S. Supreme Court decision opened the tap, Muller argued, by equating money with speech and corporations with people.
When Sykes opened the floor for questions, two attendees interrupted the event to criticize her for accepting roughly $180,000 from pro-Israel organizations. They were quickly ushered out of the building, and joined several other demonstrators lining the street outside protesting Israel’s war in Gaza.
Other constituents asked about all sorts of issues — passenger rail, solar, school funding, deploying the national guard in American cities. While it was clear Sykes sympathized with their concerns, and committed to fight for them, she had to acknowledge that as a minority member her capacity to make progress is limited.

In limbo
Bill Wyss brought up Medicaid. What happens for seniors who are expecting the program to help cover their long-term care?
Medicare, the health program for elderly and disabled Americans, generally doesn’t cover long-term care, but Medicaid, which serves the poor, does. That means many older Americans must spend down their assets before becoming eligible. The Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act puts that eligibility into doubt.
Sykes told Wyss the details will get hammered out as the bill is implemented, but the cost is shared with the state. With state lawmakers focused policies that reduce state revenue, like the new flat state income tax, there will be less money to go around.
“So, it is going to be bad,” she said. “I don’t know exactly what it’s going to look like, who’s going to be impacted how, or exactly when, but it is not going to be good.”
“I am especially concerned about the folks who have to spend down,” she added. “Who then won’t have anything, any assets to rely upon, because they spent them down thinking they would have Medicaid to support them.”
Speaking outside, Wyss explained the question was personal. His mother has advanced dementia, and after living with Wyss’ family for two years, her condition deteriorated enough that she needed full-time care. Wyss explained she’s in a memory care unit and has gone through about $275,000 in savings.
“She’s just about to the point now where she’s out of funds, and it’s time to apply for Medicaid,” he said. “That’s always been there, but maybe not.”
“And that’s, yes, our personal situation,” Wyss said, “but that’s America’s situation. We’re gonna be talking about, you know, hundreds of thousands of people maybe who have been in nursing home care of some kind and may be thrown out.”
Jodi Roberts asked Sykes about immigration policy. Roberts hosted a family as part of a Biden-era humanitarian parole program called Uniting for Ukraine.
“They are doing the things that we would expect them to do, to hold down jobs, to pay taxes, and now their statuses are at risk,” she said. “Is there any hope? Is there any movement in Congress on behalf of these families?
Sykes pointed to a brief window of optimism last year when a bipartisan group of Senators began hashing out a compromise pairing immigration reforms to funding for Israel and Ukraine.
“One call from candidate Trump to kill the bill, kill the bill and that’s what happened,” Sykes said.
“This is a problem that has been created by the lack of action by Congress,” Sykes acknowledged. “There is not a clear, predictable pathway to coming into this country, and so people choose to come in through illegal means and just hope that they can stay.”
Roberts said within seven months the family she sponsored was on their feet and able to get a place of their own.
“They would like to make a life here,” Roberts said, “They would like to put down roots.”
The problem is the parole program only gives them two years in the U.S. Roberts said they’ve filed for a renewal, but they can’t get an answer.
“It’s like crickets,” she said.

Many American businesses are bracing for higher costs after President Donald Trump levied wide-ranging tariffs this spring, a move that economists have largely panned. But for workers in southeastern Michigan, the heart of the U.S. automotive industry, the story is a little more complicated. Here, manufacturing is “our lifeblood,” according to Sean Crawford, a skilled trades apprentice at General Motors’ Warren Tech Center in suburban Detroit.
A Trump critic, Crawford is mostly skeptical that tariffs will lead to more or better jobs. But Crawford’s co-workers have generally welcomed tariffs on foreign auto manufacturers, he said. As a third-generation autoworker, he understands the appeal. “They’re just happy something is being done,” he said.
Crawford grew up in Flint, Michigan, where he witnessed the loss of thousands of GM jobs decimate the town’s economy. For generations, manufacturing jobs helped people in the region build stable lives — purchase homes, raise families and end their careers with secure retirement.
Trump tapped into that manufacturing mythos when he vowed to make the country “a manufacturing nation once again” in his inauguration speech. He had repeated this message often on the campaign trail, promising to “create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.”
Yet rather than the promised manufacturing revival, the first eight months of Trump’s second term have brought uncertainty and upheaval. Widespread tariffs stalled hiring and rollbacks of clean energy policies have stymied investment and disrupted the fragile momentum that had been building under President Joe Biden, whose legislative agenda had spurred investment in manufacturing.
The fledgling growth of domestic manufacturing that had created more than 610,000 manufacturing jobs during the Biden administration and laid the groundwork for many more has “basically collapsed,” said Todd Tucker, director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute, a Washington-based, left-leaning think tank.
In fact, Trump was so dissatisfied with the weak July jobs report — which showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector had lost 37,000 jobs over three straight months — that he fired the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in early August, alleging on his social media platform Truth Social that the less-than-stellar job numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Since the president first announced his sweeping tariffs, the country’s trade policy has been marked by chaos and volatility. The tariffs have been wielded for sharply different purposes, with some intended to protect domestic markets and others aimed at punishing foreign countries for actions Trump doesn’t like. That shifting rationale has deepened the sense of uncertainty, as have the constantly changing tariff rates. In addition, countries around the world have responded to the new trade regime with their own retaliatory tariffs.
“It’s almost impossible to keep up with the new deals, the new tariffs, the tariff cuts and the tariff hikes,” said Tucker. The instability is “the opposite of what companies need to be able to make long-term investments.”
That uncertainty has had a chilling effect on manufacturing. Many companies are pulling back from hiring simply because, amid the impulsive and erratic policymaking of the Trump administration, they don’t know what will happen next.
According to a second-quarter survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, just 55.4% of manufacturers are optimistic about the future of their companies — a 15-percentage-point drop since the first quarter and the lowest rating since the early days of the pandemic. Indeed, 89% of manufacturers surveyed said that operational costs have increased due to tariffs. While economists have criticized the broad reach of Trump’s tariffs, Tucker said that “select, strategic and targeted tariffs” could help some American industries.
Crawford’s union, the United Auto Workers, hopes that the 25% tariff on most foreign automakers will lead to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing and more stable jobs for autoworkers. (Japan, whose automakers hold a significant share of the U.S. market, recently negotiated its tariff rate down to 15% in a deal with the Trump administration.)
“[W]e do not support reckless chaotic tariffs on all countries,” UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in an April op-ed for Jacobin. But auto tariffs, he wrote, are “a first step in ending the free-trade disaster,” adding that “the automakers, the auto market, and corporate America can afford it.”
Crawford is not so sure tariffs are a winning strategy, even tariffs on foreign car makers.  “With the tariffs swinging as wildly as they are … I feel like a lot of [car] companies aren’t on firm footing,” he said. He said it’s possible that his job and workplace could benefit, adding that even one additional shift at a plant could create jobs that would be a boon to the local economy. But he doubts that tariffs will inspire companies to break ground on new facilities. Instead, he reasons that if companies pass off tariff costs onto consumers, demand will decline, and layoffs could follow.
Crawford’s concerns about layoffs have already been borne out. GM’s profit fell by more than $1 billion in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2024, a decline executives attributed in part to tariffs. The company temporarily laid off 200 workers at a factory in Detroit suburb Hamtramck in April (though GM representatives blamed “market dynamics,” not tariffs.) That same month, Stellantis laid off 900 workers following dismal quarterly earnings, and Volvo cut more than 1,000 workers at its Mack Truck plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.
At the same time, tariff pressures led GM to announce in April that the company would increase production at a plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and hire 225-250 temporary workers. But temporary workers earn lower pay than other hourly workers and also receive fewer benefits. Temporary status may not even be temporary; Crawford said he’s known temporary workers that have held “temporary” positions for as many as seven years. And that’s not including the workers hired by third-party agencies to do auto production work for companies like GM.
“Yeah, American manufacturing, rah rah rah,” Crawford said sarcastically. “But are those actually going to be good jobs? Are they going to be unionized jobs? Are they going to be family and community supporting jobs?”
If not, he thinks the rhetoric is just “emotionally exploiting” workers who want the secure and stable work manufacturing once promised.
While it remains to be seen how exactly auto manufacturing will be impacted by tariffs, clean energy manufacturing — which was growing rapidly under the Biden administration — has been hard hit by Trump’s industrial policy. Since the start of 2025, more than $18 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects have been cancelled, according to data from environmental business coalition E2. Those cancellations translate into thousands of jobs that will never materialize.
“We were on the cusp of an economic revolution the likes we haven’t seen in generations,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “Unfortunately, that is now at risk,” he said.
As just one example, more than 1,000 jobs were intended for union sheet metalworkers at a Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. site near Dayton, Ohio, that was set to transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen. Instead, the facility will continue to produce “beautiful coal,” with a goal to “operate fully under AI,” CEO Lourenco Goncalves said in a July earnings call. According to Steel Industry News, the AI operation is meant to increase efficiency for the company by 15%-20%.
“Automation is the name of the game” in many facilities, Babak Hafezi, adjunct professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business and CEO of international consulting firm Hafezi Capital, said in an email. He predicts companies will choose between two strategies if Trump’s trade policy stands: Use exclusively domestic materials alongside automation — in which cases workers are unlikely to benefit — or move production to the cheapest country possible. Either way, workers — and communities that rely on manufacturing — will lose, according to Hafezi.
Crawford believes a stronger labor movement is ultimately what will lead to a resurgence of American manufacturing jobs. It’s hard for workers to bargain for jobs when unions “don’t really have the same dominance in the auto sector like we used to,” he said. He is unsurprised that some manufacturing workers have welcomed tariffs, even if they may mean higher prices and fewer opportunities for other workers.
“People want jobs,” Crawford said. “That’s understandable.”

The Trump administration has ordered construction stopped on Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project, even though it is 80% complete.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.
Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.
“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”
The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.
“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

– Attorneys generals in an Aug. 28 filing as part of a multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration


The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.
Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
Stuck in limbo
Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.
“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”
Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.
Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.
“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.
The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.
Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”
The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.
Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line. For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders. We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”
DOT yanks port funding
The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Friday it was pulling $679 million in federal infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country. Among the casualties: an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.
“The Quonset Development Corporation is disappointed by this decision but understands that this administration is working to fund projects in line with its current policy priorities,” Steven King, managing director for the quasi-public state agency, said in an emailed response Friday. “Given that the Quonset Business Park’s 250 companies work broadly across nearly every sector of the economy, including in shipbuilding, we believe there is common ground to pursue and look forward to working together on new grant projects that align with the administration’s objectives and that grow the economy.”
Gov. Dan McKee was not as forgiving.
“This decision undermines progress on critical infrastructure and threatens Rhode Island’s economic and energy future,” McKee said in a statement late Friday afternoon. “The Port of Davisville and the broader Quonset Business Park are vital hubs for manufacturing, shipping, and energy, including the state’s offshore wind industry. This funding would have modernized port infrastructure and expanded cargo capacity. By withdrawing it, the Trump administration is undermining a high-performing port that drives real economic output, strengthens regional supply chains, and plays a central role in advancing energy and long-term growth for Rhode Island and across the Northeast.”
The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”
Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.
Judge Young is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing. A ruling will come at a later, unscheduled date.

I enjoy words. But like most of our state and country today, words have become politicized. Look no further than retired assistant U.S. attorney Leon Patton, who testified in front of the Lenexa City Council last month about using the word “alien” to refer to undocumented immigrants.

“If you think that it’s somehow racist to use the word ‘alien,’ then I presume you got your education by sitting in movie theaters and watching movies about extraterrestrials,” Patton said. “Meanwhile, some of us get our education by sitting in courtrooms and by reading federal statutes.”
Although he later told Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith that “I sort of get it,” when talking about the term’s implications, I personally find such a strong reaction to word choice baffling. Language changes and evolves, and has since the beginning of time. The words we once used freely may go into the “forbidden” box. That doesn’t mean anyone has done anything good or bad, necessarily; it just means that tastes have changed.
Progressives worry about such overreactions these days. Perhaps it’s because of President Trump’s linguistic overflow, a constant stream of crude invective. Should they be talking like him? Perhaps it’s because of genuine concern about reaching a broader audience.
Nonetheless, moderate Democratic think tank Third Way just released a list of words that its says politicians should avoid using when talking to the general public.
You can read them all in the accompanying box below.
“We are putting a spotlight on the language we use that puts a wall between us and everyday people of all races, religions, and ethnicities,” the group writes. “These are words that people simply do not say, yet they hear them from Democrats.”
The list doesn’t appear to draw from any polling or research. As a longtime journalist, I’m reminded of “banned words” compilations that grizzled copy editors would pass around in decades past, harping on supposedly ungrammatical or illogical terms.
I don’t love many of the words, and Third Way may have a point. So did the grizzled copy editors! That being said, I’m not sure that studiously avoiding such terms will hand the magical keys to power to progressives. After all, Trump has conspicuously said whatever the heck he wanted. Do political consultants think that lawmakers policing their vocabulary more will improve the situation?
No, the real problem with these politically correct terms is that regular folks just don’t know what they mean. That leaves them open to misinterpretation and outright distortion by political opponents. (Remember “critical race theory”?)
If language has any point besides sounding pretty, it needs to communicate efficiently and clearly. That’s one of the reasons why journalists traditionally avoid language like “passed away” or “went on to his heavenly reward” in favor of the blunt: “he died.”
So yes, do that. But will using a random word from Third Way’s list – or trying to make people think about what they’re saying in the first place – doom democracy?
If so, we have far bigger problems than vocabulary.
Speaking of problems, Kansas legislators just banned some of the simplest words – pronouns – from state employees’ email signatures. That’s right, “he/him,” “she/her,” “they/them” and the like. The last time I checked, such language serves as basic building blocks of English sentences. Perhaps if lawmakers wrote more often, they would understand that.
But conservatives have decided that using such words in a signature block signifies an unacceptable embrace of “gender ideology.” Talk about ridiculous terms.
Including pronouns in an email signature block demonstrates sensitivity and support for transgender people. For today’s senselessly cruel rightwing ideologues, that counts as an unpardonable sin.
So the Kansas Legislature just banned the practice altogether.
The difference, then, between the left and right when it comes to disputed language? Liberals are trying to police themselves to appeal to a greater number of people. Conservatives are literally obliterating disfavored groups’ identities.
I’m not sure that using preferred language always makes a difference. But I know that listening does. And I know that allowing people to use the language they choose, to speak about what they want, can change the world.
What’s in a word? These days, a hell of a lot.

Small local organizations called Active Clubs have spread widely across the U.S. and internationally, using fitness as a cover for a much more alarming mission. These groups are a new and harder-to-detect form of white supremacist organizing that merges extremist ideology with fitness and combat sports culture.
Active Clubs frame themselves as innocuous workout groups on digital platforms and decentralized networks to recruit, radicalize and prepare members for racist violence. The clubs commonly use encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, Wire and Matrix to coordinate internally.
For broader propaganda and outreach they rely on alternative social media platforms such as Gab, Odysee, VK and sometimes BitChute. They also selectively use mainstream sites such as Instagram, Facebook, X and TikTok, until those sites ban the clubs.
Active Club members have been implicated in orchestrating and distributing neo-Nazi recruitment videos and manifestos. In late 2023, for instance, two Ontario men, Kristoffer Nippak and Matthew Althorpe, were arrested and charged with distributing materials for the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division and the transnational terrorist group Terrorgram.
Following their arrests, Active Club Canada’s public network went dark, Telegram pages were deleted or rebranded, and the club went virtually silent. Nippak was granted bail under strict conditions, while Althorpe remains in custody.
As a sociologist studying extremism and white supremacy since 1993, I have watched the movement shift from formal organizations to small, decentralized cells – a change embodied most clearly by Active Clubs.
 White nationalism 3.0

According to private analysts who track far-right extremist activities, the Active Club network has a core membership of 400 to 1,200 white men globally, plus sympathizers, online supporters and passive members. The clubs mainly target young white men in their late teens and twenties.
Since 2020, Active Clubs have expanded rapidly across the United States, Canada and Europe, including the U.K., France, Sweden and Finland. Precise numbers are hard to verify, but the clubs appear to be spreading, according to The Counter Extremism Project, the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and my own research.
The clubs reportedly operate in at least 25 U.S. states, and potentially as many as 34. Active U.S. chapters reportedly increased from 49 in 2023 to 78 in 2025.
The clubs’ rise reflects a broader shift in white supremacist strategy, away from formal organizations and social movements. In 2020, American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo introduced the concept of “White Nationalism 3.0” – a decentralized, branded and fitness-based approach to extremist organizing.
Rundo previously founded the Rise Above Movement, which was a violent, far-right extremist group in the U.S. known for promoting white nationalist ideology, organizing street fights and coordinating through social media. The organization carried out attacks at protests and rallies from 2016 through 2018.
Active Clubs embed their ideology within apolitical activities such as martial arts and weightlifting. This model allows them to blend in with mainstream fitness communities. However, their deeper purpose is to prepare members for racial conflict.
 ‘You need to learn how to fight’

Active Club messaging glorifies discipline, masculinity and strength – a “warrior identity” designed to attract young men.
“The active club is not so much a structural organization as it is a lifestyle for those willing to work, risk and sweat to embody our ideals for themselves and to promote them to others,” Rundo explained via his Telegram channel.
“They never were like, ‘You need to learn how to fight so you can beat up people of color.’ It was like, ‘You need to learn how to fight because people want to kill you in the future,’” a former Active Club member told Vice News in 2023.
These cells are deliberately small – often under a dozen members – and self-contained, which gives them greater operational security and flexibility. Each club operates semi-autonomously while remaining connected to the broader ideology and digital network.
 Expanding globally and deepening ties

Active Clubs maintain strategic and ideological connections with formal white supremacist groups, including Patriot Front, a white nationalist and neofascist group founded in 2017 by Thomas Rousseau after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Active Clubs share extremist beliefs with these organizations, including racial hierarchy and the “Great Replacement” theory, which claims white populations are being deliberately replaced by nonwhite immigrants. While publicly presenting as fitness groups, they may collaborate with white supremacist groups on recruitment, training, propaganda or public events.
Figures connected to accelerationist groups – organizations that seek to create social chaos and societal collapse that they believe will lead to a race war and the destruction of liberal democracy – played a role in founding the Active Club network. Along with the Rise Above Movement, they include Atomwaffen Division and another neo-Nazi group, The Base – organizations that repackage violent fascism to appeal to disaffected young white men in the U.S.
 Brotherhood as a cover

By downplaying explicit hate symbols and emphasizing strength and preparedness, Active Clubs appeal to a new generation of recruits who may not initially identify with overt racism but are drawn to a culture of hypermasculinity and self-improvement.
Anyone can start a local Active Club chapter with minimal oversight. This autonomy makes it hard for law enforcement agencies to monitor the groups and helps the network grow rapidly.
Shared branding and digital propaganda maintain ideological consistency. Through this approach, Active Clubs have built a transnational network of echo chambers, recruitment pipelines and paramilitary-style training in parks and gyms.
Club members engage in activities such as combat sports training, propaganda dissemination and ideological conditioning. Fight sessions are often recorded and shared online as recruitment tools.
Members distribute flyers, stickers and online content to spread white supremacist messages. Active Clubs embed themselves in local communities by hosting events, promoting physical fitness, staging public actions and sharing propaganda.
Potential members first see propaganda on encrypted apps such as Telegram or on social media. The clubs recruit in person at gyms, protests and local events, vetting new members to ensure they share the group’s beliefs and can be trusted to maintain secrecy.
 From fringe to functioning network

Based on current information from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, there are 187 active chapters within the Active Club Network across 27 countries – a 25% increase from late 2023. The Crowd Counting Consortium documented 27 protest events involving Active Clubs in 2022-2023.
However, precise membership numbers remain difficult to ascertain. Some groups call themselves “youth clubs” but share similar ideas and aesthetics and engage in similar activities.
Active Club members view themselves as defenders of Western civilization and masculine virtue. From their perspective, their activities represent noble resistance rather than hate. Members are encouraged to stay secretive, prepare for societal collapse and build a network of committed, fit men ready to act through infiltration, activism or violence.
 Hiding in plain sight

Law enforcement agencies, researchers and civil society now face a new kind of domestic threat that wears workout clothes instead of uniforms.
Active Clubs work across international borders, bound by shared ideas and tactics and a common purpose. This is the new white nationalism: decentralized, modernized, more agile and disguised as self-improvement. What appears to be a harmless workout group may be a gateway to violent extremism, one pushup at a time.

Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Americans spend tens of billions of dollars on hidden or surprise “junk fees” that deceptively raise costs beyond advertised prices.
The post ‘Junk fees’ unfairly rob consumers. New regulations banning them go into effect today.   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT’S MOVE-IN season in Massachusetts, and you may have just seen an ad for a studio apartment for $2,500 per month. That amount is going to stretch your budget, but recognizing how competitive the housing market is, you know you need to jump on that rental quickly.  
So, you head to the management office the very next day to sign your lease. Just before signing, you notice the amount you’d have to pay every month will actually be $2,750 – beyond what you have budgeted for rent. The extra $250 comes from a mandatory “trash pick-up” fee combined with a vague “amenities” fee. You don’t want to start the daunting apartment search process over again, so you sign the lease. But the entire process leaves you feeling misled and paying more than you originally anticipated. 
We hear these stories often. If it’s not apartment fees tacked on at the last minute, it’s “resort fees” at a hotel, “convenience fees” when you purchase a ticket, or “processing fees” when checking out online.  
These fees are not simply an inconvenience – they’re a widespread, costly problem impacting all of us. Every year, Americans spend tens of billions of dollars on hidden or surprise “junk fees” that deceptively raise costs beyond advertised prices. As consumers face rising costs of living, these pesky fees quietly drain consumers’ wallets.  
This is why, as attorney general, I’ve used my authority to enact nation-leading, economy-wide consumer protection regulations making it clear that “junk fees” are prohibited under Massachusetts law.  
Effective today – these regulations are for every person who’s had their budgeting blown apart by last-minute “surprises,” for every parent who’s had to explain to their child why the gift they promised is now out of their price range, and so many more. 
Amidst an ongoing affordability crisis, these new rules will require businesses to disclose the full price of their goods and services upfront. No more misleading price advertising. No more burying fees at the end of a transaction.  
These regulations go beyond just requiring upfront pricing for one-off purchases. They’ll also help consumers more easily cancel or avoid unwanted costs related to trial offers, automatic renewals, and subscriptions – like gym memberships and meal delivery services. They’ll make it so that a 7-day free trial for an online streaming service won’t quietly turn into $150 in monthly charges without notice. They’ll ensure that you’re able to cancel that unwanted subscription the same way you signed up for it – online, not by mail. 
The regulations will also help level the playing field for businesses by allowing potential customers to more accurately compare prices while shopping. That way, the next time you go shopping in Massachusetts, you’ll know exactly how much something costs, excluding taxes and shipping charges, before you decide to check-out. And no business will be allowed to hide those fees until the last moment before purchase. 
Massachusetts has long been on the forefront of consumer protection, having some of the strongest laws in the country. And my office’s “junk fee” regulations are just one way we’ve built upon that legacy. Unlike many other state or federal counterparts, our “junk fee” regulations will apply broadly across industries and businesses operating in Massachusetts – making them stronger, bolder, and truly nation-leading.  
As the current federal administration steps back from consumer protection – as evidenced by its efforts to dismantle one of the nation’s chief financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – we have and will continue to step up.  
If you believe you’ve experienced an unfair or deceptive “junk fee,” you may file a consumer complaint with my office online at mass.gov/ago. And more information regarding our “junk fee” regulations, including guidance to help businesses comply with the new rules, is available online at mass.gov/ago/junkfees. 
Today, we turn the page on “junk fees” and deceptive costs. Today, the price you see is the price you pay.

(Taylor Sisk for KFF Health News)Rebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan’s capital city that she never would have expected.
“It’s a very weird time in our lives,” said Kasen, executive director of the Women’s Center of Greater Lansing.
Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women’s Center staff reported being harassed.
A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by “First Amendment auditors” outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.
In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.
Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward “an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions.”
Researchers at American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, “hate is intersectional.” (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL’s director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of “A Minecraft Movie” prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.
The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.
The team defines extremism as the belief that one’s group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity, or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.
Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they’re on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)
Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s deputy director for prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that’s rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?
They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip “all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism” and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.
“We’re not about, ‘How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?’” Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL’s deputy director for regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. “Rather, ‘How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?’”
Tim McVeigh
Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.
The state’s capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.
Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer’s covid lockdown directives.
Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about “how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible.”
The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and “Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry.”
Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.
The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.
Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She’s a proponent of the public health approach. It’s “providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward,” she said. It’s a way to channel energy “and feel like you can actually create change with community.”
Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.
In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” at an American Legion post.
In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book “They She He Me: Free to Be!” Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.
“It’s really important that rural communities not be left behind,” Flanagan said. “They persistently are in America, and then they’re often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges.”
National plans
The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children’s Hospital’s Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City’s Citizens Crime Commission.
And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.
Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism’s having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. “It’s just devastating,” he said. “It’s really startling.”
Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, “I would say now it has been completely shattered.” Violent extremists now feel “unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back.”
“We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime,” Simi said.
The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people’s lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.
“If you have a germ out there,” Whitaker said, “and people aren’t aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it’s an actual problem, you won’t enact basic protective behavior.”

The Boston Globe reported recently that a small group of neo-Nazis gathered outside the New Hampshire State House in Concord. Wearing facemasks, they held a banner proclaiming “Trump loves Epstein.” Were they saying this was a good thing? Or were they protesting? What about Nazis’ historical hatred of Jews? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
A posted scholarly lecture on the Virginia Museum of History and Culture’s website tells us that early KKK members wore burlap feed sacks over the faces, donned animal horns and wore white muslin masks to indicate they were “non-human,” including corpses come back to life. Who were these members of the nation’s first domestic terrorism group? The neighbors of the people they hunted? How did they feel about what they were doing? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.

Christine Palm
Today, all across the country, masked men, claiming to be representatives of the U.S. government, are snatching people off the streets, out of courtrooms, off high school ballfields, and from the lines of workers in car washes. Are they employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement? Are they self-appointed vigilantes? Are they sex traffickers acting under cover to kidnap people for sex slavery? Who knows? It is impossible to read their expressions, because they all wear masks.
Hiding one’s face is, of course, an ancient practice. Humans have always worn masks — in war and sports, in religious ritual, during celebrations, and on stage. Shakespeare’s lovers donned them at masquerade balls. Bad guys like Darth Vader and Jason Voorhees wear masks. But so do good guys like Batman, Spiderman and Zorro. Complex anti-heroes like the Phantom of the Opera maintain their mystery behind a mask. And of course children love the strange, freeing anonymity a mask gives them at Hallowe’en.
Most of us — those who respect science and were concerned for others’ safety — wore masks for three long years during the Covid pandemic. And we were thrilled to toss them once the vaccine allowed life to return to normal. Some folks with compromised immune systems choose to wear them still, especially in crowds.
But now? For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. Our hands instinctively fly up to our cheeks and cover our nose and mouth when we are caught doing something wrong, or embarrassing.
So a simple question for ICE agents (both real and impostors), for neo-Nazis, and for today’s white supremacists posting hateful literature on lampposts in small towns across the nation, is this: if you’re too ashamed to show your face, why are you doing what you’re doing?
People in public office (as I once was) are often stalked, harassed and ridiculed on social media. Sometimes, as in the tragic case of the state representative in Minnesota, they are murdered. The public expects elected officials to show their faces, literally and figuratively. It’s called accountability. And yes, often it puts a target on our back, as it has recently with Rep. Corey Paris, who is being sent the most racist, vile and dangerous threats from across the country for calling out ICE in his district. Still, I don’t know any elected person hiding behind a mask, unless you considerTrump’s orange make-up a bizarre version of kumadori, the stylized makeup worn in Japanese Kabuki theater.
In 2016, at a protest march I attended after Trump was first elected, I engaged a young man who seemed to be in his mid-20s. He wore a Trump tee-shirt and was heckling us from the sidelines. I asked why he was covering his face with a mask. He said something that cannot be reprinted here — something inspired by Trump’s boasting about what he does to women’s bodies. He spat out he would do that to me if I didn’t move on.
So I asked him what his mother would think of that. Yes, I admit, a prissy, perhaps uptight thing to do, but still. I wanted him to explain his thought process. After all, aren’t we liberals supposed to engage with these folks? To get to know their minds? Not to judge but, rather, to “meet them where they are?”
So instead of returning this threat with something similar about his private parts (which, as everyone knows, are a lot more fragile than a woman’s), I asked again: Does your mother know you’re doing this? He emitted a sort of grunt. I could not read his expression, because he wore a mask. But he did drop his shoulders a little, and bowed his head just a bit. The parade of marchers moved on.
I think of that young man often — he’s probably around 30 now. Plenty old enough to be a father to a child who may get measles. Perhaps his mother now has cancer and needs to enter a clinical trial that’s been defunded. Perhaps the tariffs have cost him his job. I wonder if the mask will fall from his face when the scales fall from his eyes.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke to more than 6,500 people in Portland on Labor Day, endorsing union-backed candidates for the U.S. Senate and governor who made pitches to create a government that serves workers and everyday people, not billionaires. 
Graham Platner, the oysterman challenging long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, and Troy Jackson, former president of the Maine Senate and fifth-generation logger from Allagash, joined Sanders at the “Fighting Oligarchy” rally to appeal to widespread concerns about affordability.
While repeating common critiques made by other Democrats against President Donald Trump’s administration for providing tax cuts for the wealthy while stripping funding for health care, education and other programs essential to the working class, the trio also stood up for causes moderates have avoided, such as championing tribal rights and calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis driven by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. 
“This is an unprecedented, and in fact, dangerous moment in American history,” Sanders told the crowd, with local union workers seated behind him on stage. “We have got to respond in an unprecedented way, and the way we respond is to build a kind of strong, progressive, grassroots movement, the likes of which this country has never seen.”

An anti-establishment pitch 
Portland resident Ken Bailey, a 76-year-old former member of the U.S. Air Force who joined the anti-war movement in the 1970s, sees that as more possible now than ever in his life.
Bailey considers himself a democratic socialist, like Sanders, who Bailey has been a fan of since he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont in 1981. 
“That win knocked me off my feet,” Bailey said. But, then, he hadn’t imagined the more widespread embrace of democratic socialist ideas he’s now seeing — pointing out the range of attendees: others like himself adorning grey beards, parents with their children on their hips, college students. 
He also sees momentum beyond Maine, notably Zohran Mamdani’s primary win for New York mayor. Platner’s campaign has ties to Mamdani’s, as the two share progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats.
While Graham and Jackson are Democrats, they used their speeches to separate their candidacies from the establishment. 
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” Jackson said. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Platner sees the path forward in the legacies of the labor movement and the Civil Rights Movement: “legacies of building power,” as he put it.
“Let’s be clear: we do not live in a system that is broken,” Platner said. “We live in a system that is functioning exactly as it is intended.” 
The United States is already living in an oligarchy, Sanders said, because the top 1% of earners control the economy and politicians. 
“It is not just Republicans,” he said. “It is also the fact that billionaires play a much too significant role in the Democratic Party as well.”
Sanders specifically took aim at the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2010 that allowed corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Mainers have backed campaign finance reforms several times, including in the past two general elections, but the laws have been stalled in the courts. 
But Sanders said he, and he believes attendees, have a vision for a government “of the people,” he said, and the crowd responded, “for the people.”

Maine’s ‘affordability crisis’
The speeches also focused on the economy, specifically the struggle for Mainers to afford housing, child care and other costs that have continued to increase.
“People my age and younger are being driven out of this state by an affordability crisis,” said Platner, who is 40.
That’s the reality for Sophie Creamer, 25, who grew up in Brunswick and now attends college in Massachusetts. Creamer, who is not enrolled with any political party, said they worry about being able to move back to Maine due to the lack of available and affordable housing. Creamer is also concerned about access to health care, as someone who relies on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
While Democrats’ planks often include bringing down the cost of living, Creamer thinks progressive Democrats like those on stage in Portland Monday night are needed to push the establishment to actually change the status quo. 
Jackson said he’s running for people like Jordyn Rossignol of Caribou. Rossignol said she drained her savings to make payroll for her childcare center, Miss Jordyn’s Child Development Center, but financial reasons ultimately led to its closure and around 100 children who lost care in 2023. 
Taking the stage to express her support for the candidates, Rossignol pointed to Jackson’s work championing child care reform as the former president of the Maine Senate and called Platner “a working man, a leader and someone who won’t just say he’s concerned. He will act,” referring to the oft-repeated critique of Collins’ statements of concern.  
Gigi Larrc drove from Unity to support Jackson, handing out signs to attendees. She supports him over other candidates in the crowded governor’s race because she “does not believe in political dynasties,” she said, referring to Hannah Pingree and Angus King III, who are the children of some of Maine’s current members of Congress. Jackson’s working class background appeals to her.
“When Troy is working on getting our bread-and-butter needs met, it comes from a place of solidarity, not charity,” Larrc said.
Not all attendees knew who their gubernatorial or Senate choices will be. 
Nicole Petrin and Renee Marsh from Biddeford said they attended the event to hear Sanders speak, but they were “in the market” when it came to voting for governor. Their top priority, Petrin said, was not voting for a rich politician, or someone who is backed by rich people.
The fact that Jackson was endorsed by Sanders, however, would be “a huge deal,” in their decision, both said.

In our fast-changing world, few technological developments of recent years have had a bigger impact on young people than the emergence of instant communication and social media. And while it’s not difficult to identify the positive impacts of these phenomena, the worrisome impacts are also numerous. And this is a trend that seems certain to intensify in years to come with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.
Thankfully, many advocates have started to speak out in favor of stronger laws to protect vulnerable people – especially young people – from exploitation like predatory algorithms, social media bullying, artificial intelligence and other impacts from the online world that endanger people’s mental and even physical health. And recently NC Newsline caught up with the leader of one such group, the co-founder and executive director of the Young People’s Alliance, North Carolinian Sam Hiner.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
New Mexico’s 988 lifeline still offers LGTBQ+ option

“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. He has been waiting since 2017 for a response to a U-visa application, which protects victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators, according to letter from the law firm to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon.
Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
 Gun violence leading cause of death for U.S. children, teens

For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.

Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Courtesy of SDSU Marketing and Communications)Airborne diseases have not been kind to the poultry industry in recent years.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza, which spreads through the air to the lungs of wild and captive birds, has devastated chicken and turkey flocks in waves. The price of eggs has ballooned, then fallen, as the outbreaks have flared up. Last year, the virus jumped from birds to cattle, causing trouble in the dairy industry by way of decreased milk production.
Dr. Sunil Mor of South Dakota State University thinks a lot about respiratory diseases in animals. Mor leads the virology section of the school’s Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, and has a keen interest in respiratory viruses — especially those with the potential to mutate and infect humans, known as zoonotic diseases. 
USDA rolls out $1 billion plan to combat bird flu after egg prices rise

Mor was recently named the winner of the Bayer-Snoeyenbos New Investigator Award by the American Association of Avian Pathologists, a win based on the work his lab did last year to confirm the presence of a new respiratory poultry disease in the U.S. 
Earlier this year, Mor’s team got a $150,000 grant from the Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research to develop a diagnostic tool for that disease, an emerging threat known as avian metapneumovirus. Last year, the disease cost turkey producers in Minnesota well over $100 million — a figure greater than that year’s losses from avian influenza.
Mor spoke to South Dakota Searchlight on his work, why he does it, and how SDSU’s lab can serve as a sort of airport checkpoint for disease.
EDITOR’S NOTE: This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What can you tell us about your background, and why you chose to focus on this particular area of study?
My family was raised on a farm in India, so my interest from an early age was to work with animal diseases. When I started my master’s in veterinary epidemiology and preventive medicine (in India), our department was responsible to attend to any disease outbreak in the state. I was with my supervisors, doing the investigation, the testing, and collecting more samples. 
From that point, I realized that disease investigation is the key if we want to know the exact cause of a disease. Then we can implement the prevention and control measures, and we can help the industry minimize the losses.
How did you decide to zero in on the study of respiratory viruses in poultry?
In poultry, especially with the outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, the economic losses are huge. And not only the losses due to the dead birds, but also the mental and the emotional stress and other factors. So it’s the huge impact, plus it has the genetic importance. Some of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can also infect humans, so that drew me to be more interested in the poultry viruses, with a focus on poultry respiratory viruses.
So it was realizing that if you were doing the diagnostics, you could catch the problem at the beginning and have the biggest impact?
Yes, that’s right. I like to be in a race with the viruses, or any emerging zoonotic viruses (viruses that can transmit from animals to humans), see how early I can catch them, and develop the tools to detect them as early as possible.
There’s a security checkpoint at the airport. In the diagnostic lab, we are like a TSA PreCheck security. It’s us seeing how early we can detect these kinds of deadly pathogens that may have a huge economic impact on the agricultural sector, as well as may have the potential to jump to humans. Our job is to keep an eye on any emerging threat.
What kinds of things are you most worried about coming through that checkpoint?
We’ve focused on the avian influenza virus, but now we’re doing research on this avian metapneumovirus that was detected for the first time in my lab. 
FDA chief says feds are preparing for low probability of bird flu moving to humans

Later on, USDA also confirmed our finding and declared it an emerging disease. That was a big achievement, to prove that we are a good security checkpoint for incoming or new problems for the country, not just for the state. That put us on the stage at the national level. 
We also just completed a project on SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals, zoo animals and food animals, to design tools to detect any variant in the future that may have the potential to cause a pandemic.
We also have a project right now on high-path avian influenza in cattle. As we all know, this virus jumped to cattle last year, which was big news, and also had a huge impact on the cattle industry. So we are doing surveillance to ask, ‘How widespread is this virus in the cattle?’ And then, ‘Is the virus changing over time or not?’ 
Then I’m also working on the turkey reovirus. This is considered an enteric virus, not a respiratory virus, so infections mainly go through the oral-fecal route.
How did you come to confirm the presence of a new virus in the U.S.? 
We received a phone call from North Carolina saying, ‘We have a problem going on, and we are not able to figure out the cause.’ So I received the samples, and then within three days, I confirmed that this is a new virus (for the U.S.). Within three to four months, from North Carolina, this virus had spread to almost all turkey producing states. We were receiving samples from 11 states.
How is metapneumovirus virus different from avian influenza?
Highly pathogenic avian influenza has a huge impact and kills the birds right away. If it’s positive in the flock, we just depopulate. But metapneumovirus is more like a slow poison. It reduces the immunity of the birds, so other bacteria and other viruses also start dominating. We have to manage these secondary bacterial infections, as well as the loss of the birds. We are now working on developing diagnostic tools for the rapid and specific detection of this virus, as well as vaccine development.
Do you know why North Carolina called you specifically?
When I was at the University of Minnesota and working on avian reovirus, we used to work with veterinarians all across the country. I was leading the disease investigation section. When they were not able to get any answer from other labs within three months — three months is a long time —I think they decided finally that they would reach out to me and see if I could figure out what’s going on with this new problem.
How have these emerging diseases changed the way poultry farmers do business?
Before 2023, we had very random outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Depopulation and biosecurity was enough, and there was some support from the government on the indemnity.
USDA launches national testing of milk from dairy farms to track bird flu outbreak

But now we have more, fairly regular outbreaks. That’s what happened last year. It was devastating, and it was big news with the egg prices, because so many layer farms or layer operations were infected. We’re at the point where we need to be thinking, should we just continue with these standard methods of depopulation and biosecurity measures? Or is there any need for alternative options like vaccines or some other therapeutics? Like in Europe and Asia, some countries started doing some vaccination.
I’m not sure what the future will be here to control these outbreaks, whether that’s vaccination or some novel therapeutic measures. But when it’s jumping from poultry, like to cattle last year, and then also jumping to other wild animals, zoo animals, it looks like it’s getting more localized and increasing its impact, its reach, to the different species, mammalian species, which is concerning for the human population.
Recently, there was an announcement for $100 million in funding named the High Path Poultry Innovation Grand Challenge. The focus was to look for the research applications on novel ideas to control this virus, especially to the egg layer industry, in terms of reducing the egg prices. The submission process was completed in May 2025, so we are still waiting on the decision for our proposal, but I think this funding could help us design better control measures in the future.

(Stock photo by liver Helbig via Getty Images)The new hands-free driving law in South Carolina that takes effect Monday is long overdue.
Thousands of lives have been lost while the legislation failed repeatedly.
The first state to pass a law making it illegal for drivers to hold cellphones when driving was New York in 2001. More than two-thirds of states have followed. (South Carolina became No. 33.)  And all states except Montana have a no-texting-while-driving law.
In 2023, distracted driving resulted in the deaths of 3,275 people, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which reported that “texting is the most alarming distraction.”
According to the National Safety Council, more than 12% of fatal crashes in 2023 due to distracted driving involved cellphone use. That’s a percentage largely unchanged for several years.
In September 2023, the cellphone comparison site WhistleOut graded state cellphone bans across three categories. South Carolina was among five to receive a D grade for not having a handheld ban or young driver cellphone ban.
The new law in South Carolina still allows cellphone use when the driver is stopped at a light. It has already gotten very frustrating for many of us while at lights which have turned green and one of the cars in front of us don’t move for a while — sometime to the point that the light turns red again before we get to the intersection.
With the new hands-free law, will it be any surprise if more drivers get on their phones waiting for the light to change?
Unfortunately, this law does not go nearly far enough to improve the safety on our roads.
Drivers rarely face consequences for breaking other laws. When raining during the day, most drivers have enough sense that when they turn on their windshield wipers, they also turn on their headlights. But some do not. A much larger number of drivers don’t seem to ever use or infrequently use their turn signals when turning or changing lanes.
Those rules of the road are hard to effectively enforce and would require substantially increasing law enforcement on the roads and that, clearly, is not going to happen.
There are some other things government officials can do but will require more effort and money.
For example, the Biden administration had a committee working for about three years on technology that would keep intoxicated drivers from operating a vehicle. But the committee did not meet its 2024 deadline for recommendations.
Another technology being implemented in several other countries is that of vehicle speed control. A device installed in the vehicle can slow a vehicle down if it’s traveling over the posted speed limit.
Imagine if we required that on all vehicles in the United States — if, say on Interstate 20 or Interstate 26, where the posted speed was 60 mph, a vehicle couldn’t travel more than 65 mph.
Accidents and deaths would be reduced, and we might even be able to save millions of dollars in road construction costs with all vehicles driving at a more reasonable speed.
But this approach lacks support.
So, what else, if anything, could been done in South Carolina to make our roads safer?
Vastly increasing the number of law enforcement vehicles on the road could cut down on speeding. But even if that happens, the results would be limited: Stopping a vehicle, going through the license checks, writing a citation, etc. is just so time consuming that only a very small number of vehicles could be cited in an hour.
In addition, cars tend to slow down when they see a law enforcement vehicle and speed up once they are out of sight of that vehicle.
To help resolve this problem, we could equip unmarked law enforcement vehicles with cameras and radar to catch speeders without needing to stop them. When a vehicle is going X mph over the speed limit, the cameras would record the vehicle along with the license tag and vehicle speed for maybe 10 seconds.
The enforcement vehicle’s computer would then locate the address of the vehicle’s owner and generate a citation that included the speed, time, and location of the incident.
This would allow law enforcement vehicles to send 10, 20 or more tickets every hour. Points on the driver’s license could not be assessed since there is no verification of who was driving, but after receiving a speeding ticket or two, I would hope the driver would slow down.
I can only guess how many persons might have lived or survived without severe injuries if we had addressed cellphone use 10 or 20 years ago. We now have great technology available to us if only we would consider using it.
Why are we not doing more to save lives on the road?",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/police-car-lights-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-01 12:57:10.178313
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT has more than 300 ice cream shops. This family has tried them all,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/ct-ice-cream-tour/,"After years of road trips and tastings across Connecticut, the Behuns are bringing their favorite scoops on ""tour"" throughout the state.","Craig Behun keeps a color-coded spreadsheet of every ice cream shop he’s visited. 

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
It describes each shop’s location, ice cream quality and other details, like live animals or unsavory activity in the parking lot. 
After years making the rounds, Behun and his family have selected some of their favorites to share. This summer, they transformed a food truck into a traveling creamery-on-wheels featuring a menu of ice cream flavors from all over the state.
It was no small task. In all, the Behuns visited 323 Connecticut ice cream shops.
It all started 10 years ago, when Michelle and Craig Behun’s older son, Callan, was born. “We used to go to wineries and breweries and stuff, but then we said, it’s irresponsible,” Craig said.
Searching for something to do, they set out to try Connecticut Magazine’s list of the state’s top ten ice cream spots. “Our son loved to sleep in the car, so we took advantage of road trips, and we would just put him in the car and drive,” Michelle said.
Their first stop was Rich Farm in Oxford, a family-owned business that makes ice cream on site. Now the Behuns make an annual anniversary trip there — plus dozens of other trips out for ice cream each year.
They’ve been documenting their adventures on an Instagram account called CT Ice Cream Tour since 2015. The account page is packed with delectable images of hundreds of ice cream stops in Connecticut and beyond.
From the beginning, they had their work cut out. Connecticut is home to 18,000 milking cows across 84 dairy farms, according to Bryan Hurlburt, commissioner of the Department of Agriculture.
Many daily farms deliver milk directly to consumers, or sell through a farm co-operative to a milk processor, which is how it ends up in a grocery store. The milk is also used to make yogurt, cheese, and in one case milk chocolates, Hurlburt said.
But in recent decades, small and mid-sized farms, facing rising costs for equipment and labor, have been under pressure to consolidate. The Department of Agriculture is working with some of those farms to transition from selling milk to the commodity market to developing more specialty products — like ice cream — which could be more profitable.
“What we have in Connecticut, that not every other state has, is a really interested consumer marketplace,” said Hurlburt. It’s about “different ways to take the milk and add value to it that a customer would appreciate and generate additional revenue for the farm,” said Hurlburt.
By Craig Behun’s count, Connecticut is home to about 70 homemade ice cream purveyors, which he reckons makes it the best state for ice cream stores per capita. 
One of these makers, the University of Connecticut’s Dairy Bar — where the Behuns source the vanilla ice cream served from their truck — uses milk made by the cows that graze on campus, supplemented with locally-produced cream.
Students have been taking part in ice cream production at UConn since the early 1900s, and the Dairy Bar store has been open to the public since 1953. It’s an opportunity for students to learn about ice cream production — and for locals and day-trippers to enjoy it.
The Dairy Bar serves around 250,000-300,000 customers a year. Manager Ethan Haggerty said most of those customers aren’t UConn students.
Haggerty said the secret ingredient in UConn’s ice cream is the machinery. Compared to modern production techniques that pasteurize in minutes, UConn’s 1950s-style machines pasteurize the product overnight. That “gives us a really high butter fat content, which is generally your ice cream quality,” Haggerty said.
“It’s impossible to replicate the product,” he said.

While some may call it an obsession, the Behuns describe the deliberate approach they’ve taken to assembling their ice cream menu as thoroughness.
“In order to say, ‘Here are the best,’ you have to have tried them all,” Craig said.
It’s not the only thing the Behuns are obsessed with. 
The family has also ranked every mini-golf course in the state. And last winter they went to a game for every Division I men’s basketball team in Connecticut. This year, they have plans to visit a game for every team in Division II.
One of the Behuns’ family members has visited all of New Hampshire’s covered bridges. Michelle said Craig wasn’t interested in that. “My kids are spoiled,” she said.
After 10 years of ice cream adventures with Callan and his younger brother Ashton, 7, in tow, the Behuns were ready to get in gear and start their own business. They bought a truck from now-shuttered Tipsy Cones, and the family wrapped up refurbishing it in June.
Now the truck is making appearances at events across Connecticut and stocks flavors like peach melba, Graham jam, and Guinness chip. 
It’s a logistical challenge to transport so many flavors from different places while making sure they don’t melt. The Behuns drive all over the state for their pickups, storing the ice cream in a freezer bag in the car, then in chest freezers in their basement.
Michelle said she’s spent countless hours scouring Facebook’s Marketplace looking for chest freezers. The family now owns seven. 
Callan, whose favorite flavors are Twinkie, Cookie Monster and chocolate chip, said he enjoys scooping the tail ends of the large cartons into pint containers for the family’s kitchen freezer. 
The hardest part of reaching your hand into a 3-gallon tub? “You get sticky,” Callan said.
Opening an ice cream truck “was something that we wanted to do maybe down the road, but the opportunity kind of fell in our laps” with the Tipsy Cones truck, Michelle said. 
Craig and Michelle, who are both teachers, said some of their colleagues have provided support to the ice cream operation in exchange for free treats. An art teacher made the flavor signs for the truck, and the vice principal of the boys’ school invited them to vend at a back-to-school movie night earlier in August. 
For now, the Behuns said the priority is attending their kids’ baseball games. But they’ve set up shop at several events this summer and plan to continue through the fall. 
And, of course, baseball games often end with a scoop.
“We are pretty happy people,” Michelle said.
“Everybody’s pretty happy when we’re giving them ice cream,” added Craig.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0724_SR_CTIceCreamTour_069-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 12:57:10.178313
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,1.2M immigrants are gone from the US labor force under Trump,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/immigrants-us-labor-force/,"Preliminary data show a decline of over a million immigrant workers from January to July, according to Census data analyzed by Pew.","It’s tomato season and Lidia is harvesting on farms in California’s Central Valley.
She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.
“The worry is they’ll pull you over when you’re driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”
As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation’s labor force.
More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.
Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.
The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.
“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”
Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.
Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.
“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”
‘Crops did go to waste’
Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.
Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.
“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.
In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).
Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.
Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.
“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.
Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.
“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,” said Lidia. “I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”
From construction to health care
Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.
“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.”
The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.
“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”
Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.
The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local’s president.
“What’s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?” De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren’t in the field to pick our crops? Who’s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25239821427926-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 11:58:26.635466

Many American businesses are bracing for higher costs after President Donald Trump levied wide-ranging tariffs this spring, a move that economists have largely panned. But for workers in southeastern Michigan, the heart of the U.S. automotive industry, the story is a little more complicated. Here, manufacturing is “our lifeblood,” according to Sean Crawford, a skilled trades apprentice at General Motors’ Warren Tech Center in suburban Detroit.
A Trump critic, Crawford is mostly skeptical that tariffs will lead to more or better jobs. But Crawford’s co-workers have generally welcomed tariffs on foreign auto manufacturers, he said. As a third-generation autoworker, he understands the appeal. “They’re just happy something is being done,” he said.
Crawford grew up in Flint, Michigan, where he witnessed the loss of thousands of GM jobs decimate the town’s economy. For generations, manufacturing jobs helped people in the region build stable lives — purchase homes, raise families and end their careers with secure retirement.
Trump tapped into that manufacturing mythos when he vowed to make the country “a manufacturing nation once again” in his inauguration speech. He had repeated this message often on the campaign trail, promising to “create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.”
Yet rather than the promised manufacturing revival, the first eight months of Trump’s second term have brought uncertainty and upheaval. Widespread tariffs stalled hiring and rollbacks of clean energy policies have stymied investment and disrupted the fragile momentum that had been building under President Joe Biden, whose legislative agenda had spurred investment in manufacturing.
The fledgling growth of domestic manufacturing that had created more than 610,000 manufacturing jobs during the Biden administration and laid the groundwork for many more has “basically collapsed,” said Todd Tucker, director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute, a Washington-based, left-leaning think tank.
In fact, Trump was so dissatisfied with the weak July jobs report — which showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector had lost 37,000 jobs over three straight months — that he fired the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in early August, alleging on his social media platform Truth Social that the less-than-stellar job numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
*   *   *
Since the president first announced his sweeping tariffs, the country’s trade policy has been marked by chaos and volatility. The tariffs have been wielded for sharply different purposes, with some intended to protect domestic markets and others aimed at punishing foreign countries for actions Trump doesn’t like. That shifting rationale has deepened the sense of uncertainty, as have the constantly changing tariff rates. In addition, countries around the world have responded to the new trade regime with their own retaliatory tariffs.
“It’s almost impossible to keep up with the new deals, the new tariffs, the tariff cuts and the tariff hikes,” said Tucker. The instability is “the opposite of what companies need to be able to make long-term investments.”
That uncertainty has had a chilling effect on manufacturing. Many companies are pulling back from hiring simply because, amid the impulsive and erratic policymaking of the Trump administration, they don’t know what will happen next.
According to a second-quarter survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, just 55.4% of manufacturers are optimistic about the future of their companies — a 15-percentage-point drop since the first quarter and the lowest rating since the early days of the pandemic. Indeed, 89% of manufacturers surveyed said that operational costs have increased due to tariffs. While economists have criticized the broad reach of Trump’s tariffs, Tucker said that “select, strategic and targeted tariffs” could help some American industries.
Crawford’s union, the United Auto Workers, hopes that the 25% tariff on most foreign automakers will lead to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing and more stable jobs for autoworkers. (Japan, whose automakers hold a significant share of the U.S. market, recently negotiated its tariff rate down to 15% in a deal with the Trump administration.)
“[W]e do not support reckless chaotic tariffs on all countries,” UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in an April op-ed for Jacobin. But auto tariffs, he wrote, are “a first step in ending the free-trade disaster,” adding that “the automakers, the auto market, and corporate America can afford it.”
Crawford is not so sure tariffs are a winning strategy, even tariffs on foreign car makers.  “With the tariffs swinging as wildly as they are … I feel like a lot of [car] companies aren’t on firm footing,” he said. He said it’s possible that his job and workplace could benefit, adding that even one additional shift at a plant could create jobs that would be a boon to the local economy. But he doubts that tariffs will inspire companies to break ground on new facilities. Instead, he reasons that if companies pass off tariff costs onto consumers, demand will decline, and layoffs could follow.
Crawford’s concerns about layoffs have already been borne out. GM’s profit fell by more than $1 billion in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2024, a decline executives attributed in part to tariffs. The company temporarily laid off 200 workers at a factory in Detroit suburb Hamtramck in April (though GM representatives blamed “market dynamics,” not tariffs.) That same month, Stellantis laid off 900 workers following dismal quarterly earnings, and Volvo cut more than 1,000 workers at its Mack Truck plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.
At the same time, tariff pressures led GM to announce in April that the company would increase production at a plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and hire 225-250 temporary workers. But temporary workers earn lower pay than other hourly workers and also receive fewer benefits. Temporary status may not even be temporary; Crawford said he’s known temporary workers that have held “temporary” positions for as many as seven years. And that’s not including the workers hired by third-party agencies to do auto production work for companies like GM.
“Yeah, American manufacturing, rah rah rah,” Crawford said sarcastically. “But are those actually going to be good jobs? Are they going to be unionized jobs? Are they going to be family and community supporting jobs?”
If not, he thinks the rhetoric is just “emotionally exploiting” workers who want the secure and stable work manufacturing once promised.
*   *   *
While it remains to be seen how exactly auto manufacturing will be impacted by tariffs, clean energy manufacturing — which was growing rapidly under the Biden administration — has been hard hit by Trump’s industrial policy. Since the start of 2025, more than $18 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects have been cancelled, according to data from environmental business coalition E2. Those cancellations translate into thousands of jobs that will never materialize.
“We were on the cusp of an economic revolution the likes we haven’t seen in generations,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “Unfortunately, that is now at risk,” he said.
As just one example, more than 1,000 jobs were intended for union sheet metalworkers at a Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. site near Dayton, Ohio, that was set to transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen. Instead, the facility will continue to produce “beautiful coal,” with a goal to “operate fully under AI,” CEO Lourenco Goncalves said in a July earnings call. According to Steel Industry News, the AI operation is meant to increase efficiency for the company by 15%-20%.
“Automation is the name of the game” in many facilities, Babak Hafezi, adjunct professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business and CEO of international consulting firm Hafezi Capital, said in an email. He predicts companies will choose between two strategies if Trump’s trade policy stands: Use exclusively domestic materials alongside automation — in which cases workers are unlikely to benefit — or move production to the cheapest country possible. Either way, workers — and communities that rely on manufacturing — will lose, according to Hafezi.
Crawford believes a stronger labor movement is ultimately what will lead to a resurgence of American manufacturing jobs. It’s hard for workers to bargain for jobs when unions “don’t really have the same dominance in the auto sector like we used to,” he said. He is unsurprised that some manufacturing workers have welcomed tariffs, even if they may mean higher prices and fewer opportunities for other workers.
“People want jobs,” Crawford said. “That’s understandable.”

John Lewis (D-Ga.), on July 17, 2025. (Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)“A republic, if you can keep it.” With these words Benjamin Franklin is said to have described what delegates to the Constitutional Convention created in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787.
It could hardly be described as a democracy. The founders only gave 20% of the population — white men — a direct say in choosing the House of Representatives. Members of the United States Senate would be appointed by state legislatures (until 1913) and the president would be chosen by the Electoral College, an arcane device the founders invented that could override the will of the people as expressed in the popular vote.
It’s been 105 years since the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, and 60 years since the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in elections. Since then, the direct participation of the American people in the decision-making process has broadened and deepened at all levels — city, county, state and federal.
Many have watched the first months of the Trump administration with apprehension and growing concern, as federal programs, agencies and institutions established by act of Congress are defunded, dismantled and abolished, or their missions are redefined. Respected and experienced leaders and experts have been summarily dismissed and replaced without cause or justification.

In the context of this unfolding spectacle, a question is looming on the horizon: “What is the duty of an American citizen to resist arbitrary and capricious, reckless and illegal decisions?”
One rapidly approaching challenge to the rule of law is the U.S. Supreme Court’s consideration of the Trump administration’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to all persons born in the United States, a cornerstone of our Constitution.
My ancestors first came to the shores of America in the 1660s, more than a hundred years before the Revolution, but I am still a descendant of immigrants. Perhaps a line will be crossed if the Supreme Court capitulates, fails to reaffirm the sacred right of citizenship guaranteed to all children who are born here, and denies to some the rights, privileges and obligations which are the birthright of all Americans.
Anti-immigrant fervor is running high, and being exploited for political advantage. That’s nothing new in this country. We’ve seen episodes like this throughout our history. And we’ve seen the injustices perpetrated in its name, toward the Irish, Italians, Eastern Europeans, Jews, Asians, Haitians and many others. The photograph of the father and young son laying face down in the Rio Grande a few years ago is still etched in my memory.
Outsiders are an easy target for hate. It goes without saying that there are wrong-doers in every segment of society. Wholesale disregard for the law at the southern border was totally unacceptable and unsustainable. That said, immigrants have played a vital role in building our country and they make a contribution every day to the quality of life enjoyed by all Americans.
Truth is a subterranean river that flows beneath the glittering surface of things. When we set national policy we need to be in the truth business.
Since our founding, Americans have been the natural enemies of tyrants. This year, we have reflected on America’s indispensable role in defeating Hitler and the Nazis in Europe 80 years ago.
What we’ve been witnessing in Washington since the Jan. 20 inauguration is akin to a Roman Circus devoid of Roman Virtue. If the first months are any indication of what lies ahead, the time will come when men and women of character and integrity will face a moment of truth — when they are compelled by events to decide whether to comply or resist, to be silent or to speak out. Silent obedience and passive acceptance of unjust and illegal acts being perpetrated by our government, acting in our name, is not an option.
The United States of America is not perfect. As a student activist more than a half-century ago I protested racial injustice and the war in Vietnam. Our country has not always lived up to its ideals and principles, but I still believe in our capacity to do good in the world.
America is still a work in progress.  Our future success is not assured. But our fate is not yet sealed. It’s up to us. After almost 250 years, America is still an experiment — an idea — that on its best days has gripped the imagination of the world.  In the right hands it has the potential to be, as Lincoln said, “the last best hope of Earth.”
Whether America will be a great and a good country, under a Constitution that guarantees equal justice under law, built by people from every corner of the world working together to thrive and prosper in their pursuit of happiness, will be decided in the days, months and years ahead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lewis-6287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 10:57:12.793294

Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 
California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Virginia-flooding.jpg,,,2025-09-01 10:57:12.793294

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Peniston is seeking judicial review of a 90-day license suspension, arguing the Iowa Board of Nursing improperly relied on her alleged confessions rather than citing care issues involving specific patients.
State records indicate Peniston — identified in most board records as “Penisten” — was first licensed in Iowa in 2006 as a registered nurse. She is also a licensed advanced practice nurse prescriber in the state of Wisconsin.

According to the Iowa Board of Nursing, Peniston was previously disciplined by the board in 2021, at which time she entered into a settlement agreement to resolve charges of improperly prescribing, dispensing, administering or distributing drugs; prescribing, dispensing, or administering drugs to individuals who are not patients or are outside the licensee’s specialty area; and improper delegation of nursing services.
The board alleged Peniston, “without any formal training for the service, (was) acting as a supervisor to a registered nurse providing Botox and dermal fillers.” Peniston allegedly allowed the nurse to order Botox and dermal fillers under her prescriptive authority, did not see the patients which received Botox or dermal fillers, and did not provide direction to the nurse on the drug’s administration.
The board required Peniston to stop supervising nurses who administered Botox and dermal fillers until she received specified training and 4.6 hours of training in professional accountability and legal liability.
On Aug. 23, 2023, the Board received a complaint concerning intravenous therapy services provided by a company based in Iowa called IV Therapy.
Through its investigation, the board confirmed that Peniston was the medical director for IV Therapy from November 2021 through September 2022, and was also serving as the medical director for at least two other “medical spas” in Iowa and Wisconsin. Peniston had also been running an aesthetics practice, Vivid Life Spa, since November 2021, and served as the medical director of Vivid IV, according to the board.
The board alleges Peniston admitted she did not meet with all of the spas’ Botox and IV patients, either in person or virtually. The board alleges she admitted that she reviewed documentation submitted online by the patients, and then other nurses administered treatments with the use of her guidelines and a set of standing orders that were not patient specific.
Board cites past issues with Botox patients
In December 2024, based on its findings, the board charged Peniston with professional incompetence. After a hearing on the matter, the board concluded Peniston failed to adhere to the standards of practice for advanced registered nurse practitioners.
The board found that while Peniston served as a medical director at multiple businesses that provided Botox injections and IV infusions, she admitted that she didn’t meet with patients in person or virtually to establish a patient-provider relationship, and admitted she did not perform an initial assessment or establish a plan of care as required by state regulations.
“The board is concerned that despite previous discipline related to her failure to meet with Botox patients prior to treatment, (Peniston) has continued to engage in this practice,” the board said in imposing a 90-day license suspension.
The board also ordered that upon reinstatement of her license, Peniston cease and desist from serving as a medical director for a medical spa and that she refrain from overseeing the provision of medical spa services in any facility.
In her newly filed court petition seeking judicial review of the board’s actions, Peniston argues that “not a single patient or case was identified” during her hearing and the board instead relied upon “hearsay and vague and overly general ‘admissions’” that were attributed to her.
“The state’s evidence failed to assert a violation of any single patient or case handled by Nurse Peniston,” the petition alleges. “The state did not introduce a single patient file, nor did the peer reviewer actually review any patient or case.”
The Board of Nursing has yet to file a response to the petition.

(Photo by Dennis Schroeder/NREL)For years, urban Alaska utilities have been studying large-scale wind farms that could help break the state’s dependence on natural gas power — encouraged by the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits from the federal government.
Next summer, however, those tax credits will largely disappear for projects that haven’t started construction, a consequence of the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in July.
Clean energy advocates, and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, had said they hoped that Alaska wind projects could still advance in time to qualify.
But in recent weeks, board members and executives at the cooperatively owned utilities have acknowledged that the timeline now appears too short — which means any large-scale projects will now have to be built without the generous federal subsidies, or wait to see if Congress reestablishes a more favorable tax regime.
Critics say the absence of major new renewable projects will leave the state dependent on imported, liquefied natural gas and could make consumers vulnerable to price spikes.
“There’s an argument to be made that these electric cooperatives, whose boards have a fiduciary responsibility to the member-owners, have really frittered away one of the greatest opportunities they’ve ever had to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars of value to their members,” said Phil Wight, an energy historian and professor at University of Alaska Fairbanks. “At the highest level, I think that’s a fair argument.”
Since Congress approved expanded tax credits in 2022, Alaska has seen no large-scale wind or solar projects begin construction, while other states like Wyoming and Texas have received billions of dollars in clean energy investment.
At a recent meeting, board members at Golden Valley Electric Association, the utility that generates power for Fairbanks area residents and mines, rejected a developer’s bid to advance a large-scale wind farm on a schedule driven by the expiring tax credits. Utility officials said there was still too much uncertainty about final pricing and whether the project could capture the credits.
Meanwhile, officials at Anchorage-based Chugach Electric Association, the state’s largest power utility, say that another large wind project they’ve been studying with the same developer also won’t be ready to start construction in time to qualify for the credits.
Jim Nordlund, a Chugach Electric Association board member, said that if the Anchorage-area project had captured the credits, it was still far from clear that it could have provided power more cheaply than his utility’s existing natural gas plants.
That’s even assuming prices will rise when local fuel supplies dry up and utilities begin importing liquefied natural gas in the next few years, added Nordlund, a self-described clean energy advocate.
The price of renewable power generally, he said, “is really high.”
Alaskans who are frustrated about the pace of wind and solar development shouldn’t blame the urban utilities, Nordlund added. Private companies, not the utilities themselves, have been advancing projects that failed to materialize, he said, and politics also played a big role.
“If you want to blame anybody for this, it would be that big bad bill. That’s what Trump wanted to do, and it worked,” Nordlund said. “It shut down, at least for the time being, our projects.”
But renewable energy boosters say that the urban utilities deserve at least some share of the blame for not advancing projects more urgently while the tax credits were in place.
The utilities could have developed large wind developments themselves, those advocates argue — or they could have done more to create a stable and attractive market for private developers.
“The utilities are uniquely bureaucratic and expensive in their own self-development. And they’re uniquely bureaucratic and obstinate and slow if a private company is developing,” said Ethan Schutt, who formerly managed the energy assets of an Indigenous-owned regional corporation.
Advocates say utility leaders have also failed to endorse, and in some cases outright opposed, legislation proposed multiple times in recent years to establish renewable energy quotas — which they say could have encouraged more private developers to work in the state.
Large-scale power projects “need to be thoughtfully implemented,” Natalie Kiley-Bergen, energy lead at an advocacy organization called Alaska Public Interest Research Group, said in an email.
“Had more progress been made in the last five years — even the last 15 years — to create a competitive market environment with regulatory and economic certainty for these projects, we could have seen responsible project commitments regardless of federal changes,” Kiley-Bergen said. “Not capitalizing on these tax credits is a product of years of moving slowly on the tremendous opportunities to diversify our energy generation.”
A risk of price spikes?
After its initial discovery in the 1950s, Cook Inlet, the offshore and onshore petroleum basin southwest of Anchorage, produced huge quantities of natural gas.
There was enough fuel to generate not just the vast majority of the region’s electric power, but also to supply plants that produced fertilizer and exported gas in liquefied form to Asia.
But those plants have now closed amid Cook Inlet production declines. And for more than a decade, the urban electric utilities have been contending with risk that gas supply won’t be adequate to meet demand.
Generous state tax credits temporarily approved by lawmakers in 2010 helped stimulate new drilling, but only temporarily, and they were subsequently repealed. Three years ago, Cook Inlet’s dominant producer, Hilcorp, warned utilities that they should not expect new long-term commitments of gas when their existing contracts expire in the coming years.
Clean energy advocates say that Alaskans’ dependence on gas-fired power — Chugach Electric Association generates 87% of its power from the fuel — makes residents vulnerable to both supply disruptions and fluctuations in price.
The utilities have responded to the looming local gas shortfall with plans for new infrastructure that could offload imported liquefied natural gas, known as LNG, shipped from Canada or the Gulf of Mexico.
But unlike gas from Cook Inlet, which producers have long sold at a fixed cost, utilities would likely have to buy LNG at rates that swing with the market, similar to the price of oil, according to Antony Scott, an analyst at the Renewable Energy Alaska Project advocacy group who once studied petroleum pricing for Alaska’s state government.
Given the risk of price spikes that could translate into higher electricity prices for consumers, diversifying with new wind and solar development should be a “no-brainer,” Scott said.
“It’s just like an investment portfolio. Do you want to invest only in Tesla?” Scott said. “A rational, prudent investor would have a diversified portfolio.”
Scott’s advocacy group, and others in Alaska, have pushed the utilities to diversify, in part through lobbying for the creation of the renewable energy quotas.
They cite analyses like a study released last year by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which found that new renewables would be cheaper than burning gas in existing plants and, by 2040, could meet up to 80% of demand.
“Ratepayers in Alaska have been saying, for a long time, that we need renewable energy projects here at home, and we need to be capturing energy here at home,” said Alex Petkanas, clean energy and climate program manager at the Alaska Center conservation group. “This is not something that is a surprise — that our local natural gas supply is ending, and we need to replace that with new generation.”
A rejected agreement
Utility staff and board members agree that they need to diversify away from gas, with the chief executive of Matanuska Electric Association saying in 2022 that it was “untenable” to continue generating 85% of power from one type of fuel.
Chugach Electric Association aims to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2040, which would likely require sharp reduction in its use of natural gas. And a Golden Valley Electric Association strategic plan approved last year calls for the utility to finalize agreements with private developers to bring on “large-scale wind resources” at prices that will lower members’ power costs.
None of those utilities have moved to build major wind or solar farms themselves; instead, they’ve looked to private companies to do the construction and sell the power onto the grid.
Just one firm, Longroad Energy, has advanced large-scale wind projects on a timeline that could have qualified for the expiring tax credits. One is outside Anchorage in Chugach Electric Association’s region, and one is outside Fairbanks, in Golden Valley Electric Association’s region.
The Fairbanks area project, known as Shovel Creek Wind, could produce one-third of the power consumed by Golden Valley’s members — and even generate more than 100% of their demand at certain times, depending on the size of the development, said Golden Valley’s chief executive, Travis Million.
But at a July board meeting, Golden Valley’s board members rejected an agreement that Longroad had proposed to keep the project on a timeline to qualify for the credits.
Golden Valley, said Million, still needed more time to finish a study of how much it would have to spend on infrastructure upgrades and its existing fossil fuel plants in order to accommodate power from the new wind project. Utilities must balance swings in power production that stem from the natural variability of wind.
“Without having that step done, there’s just so much uncertainty about the cost. And not knowing what that end result would be to our members, we just could not commit,” Million said in a recent interview. The details of the proposed agreement — including Longroad’s estimated pricing — are confidential under a non-disclosure agreement.
There was additional uncertainty, Million added, about whether the Trump administration, which has been hostile to wind power, would grant the credits even if Shovel Creek advanced on the required timeline.
But Million also acknowledged that the utility could have done more work earlier to speed up the process.
“We should have done a lot of these studies on the front end, to really understand sizing and needs on Golden Valley’s system, before we really started going down this path with trying to find developers,” Million said.
Longroad, through an Anchorage-based consultant, declined to comment. Million said that Golden Valley plans to finish its study and hasn’t ruled out advancing Shovel Creek on a slower timeline than Longroad’s proposal.
The utility is also studying a substantial, if smaller, wind project that could still qualify for the tax credits.
“We have to take control”
In Anchorage, meanwhile, officials with Chugach Electric Association said that Longroad’s work on the nearby Little Mount Susitna wind project slowed as the company focused on advancing Shovel Creek.
The developer, said Chugach board member Nordlund, isn’t ready to make the initial investment in Little Mount Susitna and couldn’t do the continuous work required in order to take advantage of the tax credits — though the utility, he added, hasn’t given up on the project moving forward in the future.
Nordlund ran for the Chugach board in 2023 as an advocate for wind and solar, saying then that “the time to act on renewables is now.”
But he said in a recent interview that there’s “misinformation” circulating that utilities are dismissing proposed wind and solar developments that would generate power more cheaply than natural gas, when that’s not clearly the case.
Chugach has its own non-disclosure agreement with Longroad that Nordlund said bars him from getting specific about prices.
But speaking generally, he added, Alaska is a tough market for private developers, compared to the Lower 48 and foreign countries where they otherwise might invest.
Construction costs in Alaska are higher given the remote setting, harsh environment and lack of contractors competing for business, Nordlund said; the relatively small consumer base also means that developers can’t capture economies of scale.
“I think we need to create a better climate for independent power producers to do business in Alaska,” Nordlund said. The stalled legislation to establish renewable energy quotas could have helped, he added, by giving those private developers more certainty that the utilities were “serious” about bringing on wind and solar projects.
“More could have been done,” he said.
Nonetheless, Nordlund said he thinks the inherently “conservative” culture of Alaska’s utilities is changing, with executives increasingly open to accommodating wind and solar power.
Chugach officials say the utility is still pursuing renewables and remains open to proposals from developers — though they are now refocusing on more modest projects that they can advance in-house, at least in the early stages. Viable projects could then, potentially, be handed off to private developers.
At meetings in recent weeks, board and staff members have discussed a small-scale solar farm that Chugach is studying at the site of one of its existing gas power plants on the far side of Cook Inlet.
They’ve also heard a presentation from a consultant who is examining potential sites for new hydroelectric development, though those projects would face a lengthy permitting process.
“We now have to take control and get in the lead,” Dustin Highers, Chugach’s vice president for corporate programs, said at a recent board meeting.
But some experts like Wight, the energy historian, remain skeptical that those efforts will end up displacing very much gas, with the exception of the smaller wind project in the Fairbanks area that he said could still “make a real difference.”
Pursuing smaller projects with better coordination between regions could be a better strategy, Wight said. But failing that, he said he expects utilities to largely continue their dependence on natural gas — whether through imported LNG, or through a proposed pipeline project from Alaska’s North Slope that’s struggled to secure commitments from investors.
“They’re going to dabble a little bit in renewables here and there, and then they’re just going to hope for cheap gas,” Wight said. “As a state, we’ve been so oil- and gas-dependent for so long that I do think there’s a cultural barrier there, to bring in the new folks who want to think differently.”

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Earlier this year, Wit Tuttell and his colleagues at North Carolina’s Visit NC tourism office were carefully watching a key metric in their monthly surveys: how many tourists weren’t coming to the mountains because they thought they weren’t accessible.
North Carolina had for months been blasting out marketing under a campaign designed to bring business back to the area after Hurricane Helene. “The best way for us to get back is for you to come back,” ads pleaded to potential visitors.
Finally, a survey showed less than 10% of people sharing that sentiment — a key watermark. Visit NC pivoted and launched a new campaign: “Rediscover the Unforgettable.”
“We want people to remember what a great experience going to the North Carolina mountains was,” Tuttell told NC Newsline in an interview. “We want them to feel like they can rediscover that. Now is the time they can go back out there.”
In the first full year since the deadliest storm in North Carolina history, tourism has been overall “sluggish,” Tuttell said. He estimated that to date, 2025 spending was “about on par” or “down anywhere from 1-3%” from 2024.
That’s not solely because of the Helene recovery or a slowdown in visitors to the mountains. But those concerns have added yet another layer to a complex tourism landscape, increasingly driven by social media chatter and an uncertain economic future.
North Carolina’s tourism office has responded with almost $14 million in custom advertising campaigns over the past year. They’ve relied on data to adjust “delicate” messaging, luring visitors back while tapping a network of influencers to boost the region across social channels.
Now, even in a “softening” market for leisure travel, Tuttell said, North Carolina as a whole is “faring better than other destinations.”

 How VisitNC has pitched the mountains in the year since Helene

Just weeks after Helene flooded western North Carolina, some storefronts and communities — if they were able — opened back up for business. It wasn’t a choice so much as a necessity, in a region so heavily driven by tourism.
Visit NC’s first post-Helene tourism campaign was a cautious one, urging visitors to return and spend money in communities that needed it. But they were careful “not to overpromise.”
“It wasn’t going to be the typical mountain vacation,” Tuttell said. “People felt that they wanted to help, but they didn’t want to interfere. So we had to get the message across that going there wasn’t going to interfere.”
Those early months of advertising were targeted as much at in-state residents as visitors from across the country. That was by design: The state wanted to remind North Carolinians of their fondness for the region — and that their neighbors needed their help.
“We sort of played on their heartstrings with the first few messages,” Tuttell said. “Knowing that people love this area, and have an affinity toward it.”
After about six months, they pivoted to “Rediscover the Unforgettable” and blasted out images of Asheville’s breweries and restaurants, cycling and rafting in the Smokies and wineries in the High Country. The idea, Tuttell said, was to shift away from a recovery-focused message to a more inspirational one.
When all is said and done, the state is hoping to be able to use their current campaign for the Piedmont and the coast: “For Real, Visit North Carolina.”
“Elsewhere, kids are watching reels on a phone,” a narrator says in one ad for the campaign, as a young girl casts a line into the water at the Outer Banks.

Visit NC’s western marketing has been paid for almost entirely through money allocated by the legislature across multiple hurricane relief packages. That allowed the agency to shift money for their “inspirational campaign” to the Piedmont and the coast.
In 2024, 71 counties saw increased visitor spending from the year before, the Department of Commerce announced Wednesday. Among the counties that saw the biggest boosts: those neighboring Helene-impacted counties, where hundreds of workers and volunteers aiding in disaster relief stayed for weeks to months.

 Social media tourism — and its pitfalls for western NC

Earlier this summer, tourism officials met with a group of influencers and social media personalities in Asheville.
Ahead of “leaf season,” they’re hoping a steady clip of posts on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms will help spur more trips, from both returning and new visitors. Visit NC has formally contracted with a few creators through its advertising agency, while others are considered more informal partners.
But they’ll all be competing with a deluge of other posts and chatter, that Tuttell says have made selling a dominant tourism-focused message harder than ever.
“In the past, what we worried about was the Weather Channel sending a team out and Jim Cantore scaring people away on your TV screens,” said Tuttell, referencing the now-retired meteorologist who reported from the field during various hurricanes and disasters. “What we really saw with this storm is that there were 1,000 different people on their phones, posting videos to social networks, that had the most influence on people and visitation.”
The state saw a dip in sentiment about visiting the mountains around the six-month anniversary of Helene. Tuttell believes that was fueled in part by old videos of flooding and destruction that resurfaced online. And he’s expecting a similar dip next month, around the one-year anniversary.
Tourism officials have, however, been able to count on one prominent person to continue boosting the region: Gov. Josh Stein.
Stein has made the recovery and revitalization of the mountains a centerpiece of his first months in office. He’s made frequent visits out to impacted communities, shaking hands with local officials and business owners. And he made an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in June.
“The governor and the First Lady have been the biggest cheerleaders we’ve had for western North Carolina,” Tuttell said. “And boy has it been beneficial.”
Stein’s office has also leaned into more casual, social media-focused promotions.
One post featured a staffer handing him a disposable camera, before clicking through the images he took while on vacation in western North Carolina.
And when Donna Kelce — mother of the Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and soon to be mother-in-law to Taylor Swift — posted that she had visited Biltmore Estate in Asheville, Stein chimed in.
“Western NC is open for business (and a wonderful place for a wedding)!” Stein wrote.

Organizers say the One Mississippi gathering at 100 Men Hall aims to “show the world what real community looks like.”
The Sept. 28 event will have food, live music and indoor and outdoor activities, including  karaoke, storytelling, limbo contests, sack races and tug-o-war.

“We’re calling it ‘where neighbors meet and compete,’ but really it’s where they play together,” said Rachel Dangermond, owner and director of 100 Men Hall.
Bay St. Louis was among the communities hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Organizers of One Mississippi say they want to promote unity and “not wait for a natural disaster to show our neighbors we’re with them.” 
Dangermond said she was inspired by current political and social unrest to unite people across all differences. Though the hall strives to celebrate cultural diversity and inclusivity, One Missississippi is meant to bring in those who don’t normally attend the hall’s concerts or other events.
“We want everyone to feel welcome — we believe that everyone should feel welcome,” she said. “But I think that there is more and more, this division that’s happening in our society, and so a lot of people don’t feel comfortable here. And so we want to have an event that invites everyone in, to do things that everyone can do, that is for everyone.”
100 Men Hall has cultural and historical significance to Bay St. Louis.
Bought in 1922 by the One Hundred Members’ Debating Benevolent Association, the hall became a multipurpose space and a popular stop on the Chitlin Circuit, an informal network of entertainment venues for Black performers. Famous blues, jazz and soul entertainers including Etta James, Big Joe Turner and Ray Charles performed there.

The original One Hundred Members’ Debating Benevolent Association disbanded in 1984, and the hall changed ownership multiple times. Dangermond bought it in 2018, and now runs it as a multipurpose space and cultural center. She also established 100 Women DBA, a nonprofit that supports the 100 Men Hall and provides scholarships and mentorships to local women of color.
“I thought, what we needed to do, most importantly, was to remind everybody in this community about who we are,” Dangermond said.

Dangermond describes Bay St. Louis as a small, artsy town. It  is home to a variety of events, many of which are hosted at 100 Men Hall. 
Honey Parker does marketing and advertising for One Mississippi and will host a story slam, where people can share five-minute anecdotes that fit the theme “Only in Mississippi.”
Parker hopes not only to celebrate those in Bay St. Louis, but also to be an example for other places.

We have such a fantastic community that is across the spectrum,” Parker said. “It’s to celebrate that, it’s to remind each other that, ‘Yeah, we have a heck of a community.’”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29110647/Exterior-photograph-of-100-Men-Hall-in-Bay-St.-Louis-Miss.-Credit-David-Lewis.jpg,,,2025-09-01 09:56:31.267731

Source NM talks to attendees — and politicians —about their glooms.","the 101st burning of Zozobra on Aug. 29, 2025 had a steampunk theme. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)For the 101st iteration of the Burning of Zozobra, organizers took the 50-foot effigy back to the future. Each year leading up to the 100th anniversary celebrated a decade of the annual tradition’s history thematically — from music to Old Man Gloom’s attire. This year, Zozobra went steampunk.
“It was the perfect fit,” Zozobra Event Chairman Ray Sandoval said in an interview several hours before the burn. “This is Zozobra’s turn of the century, and Steampunk is all about the turn of the century — from the 1800s to the 1900s— and the optimism about where technology could take you.” 
Zozobra’s hat and goggles gave the marionette a new look this year, but the big innovation came via his right hand, which this year was robotic and dexterous (Sandoval said the crew troubleshot a potentially offensive finger motion and avoided a “limb malfunction”).
The Santa Fe Kiwanis Club has stewarded Zozobra, originally created in 1924 by Santa Fe artist William “Will” Howard Shuster Jr., since 1964. A large group of volunteers oversees its annual creation, including sewing his outfits. That brings some mental challenges, seamstress Carol McGiffin. She brings a vast background in theater and costuming to the task, but she says sewing Zozobra’s outfits doesn’t fit any mold. “It’s not really costume, and it’s not really set construction and it’s not really set decorating,” she said. “I’ve done all of that, but it’s some kind of weird melding. It’s interesting. I like the way he looks.” (McGiffin said she did not have any gloom to share).
Zozobra’s look may change from year to year, but the event’s fundamental mix of art, community and collective catharsis has never altered. The puppet is filled and surrounded by glooms in myriad forms. This writer has volunteered for many years at the event table at which attendees bring their glooms in physical form — X-rays, bank notes, old photographs — and at which they take pen to paper to write them down. For 2025, Source solicited online glooms in advance of the burning (which we brought to the event for incineration), and we took to the field at the event on Friday to talk with people about what glooms they had come to purge. The answers we received ran from the personal to the political — with the elected officials and political candidates with whom we spoke landing harder on the latter.
For Sandoval, gloom came in the form of public outcry over the removal of 12 Siberian Elms at Fort Marcy Park for the event, which he said opponents mischaracterized as a last-minute undertaking that had actually begun with outreach years ago.
“My gloom is that we don’t talk to each other anymore,” Sandoval said. “We are so buried in our devices that we we’ve lost the ability to think, we’ve lost the ability to communicate, we’ve lost the ability to empathize and we’ve lost the ability to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. That is the one of the most dangerous things, because a society that can’t do that does not function.” He’s sorry, he said, “that I got heck about trees, but this event means the world to me, and these events remind us that we can put our devices down. We can be with ourselves. We can dance. We can have joy with one another. We can commiserate with one another. It reminds us of our own humanity.”










My gloom is that we don't talk to each other anymore.

After dropping off glooms, attendee Grace Wood said she had written down losing her job this year. Adrian Salazar’s gloom: “It’s just the current state of the world,” he said. Sarah Andrews was visiting from California, but knew about Zozobra because she formerly lived in Las Cruces. She wrote down gloom, she said between tears, for the recent lost her sister-in-law, her pain over her brother’s anguish, and the death of her father last year. 
Santa Fe Kiwanis Club President Ned Harris understands the role Zozobra can play in personal grief. His late wife Elizabeth was Zozobra’s official seamstress before her death in 2022, and the year after he burned a packet of the condolence cards he received. This year, he said, his gloom took on a more aspirational form, he said. “Just things that I hope for myself, my community, my state, my country — from the ridiculous to the sublime.”

New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department Deputy Communications Director Jessica Preston said her gloom is “the public health issues that we have in Northern New Mexico, particularly substance use issues. I’m hoping that we can all come together as a city, as a state, as a country, and help support those who are more vulnerable than ourselves,” she said, adding: “I would also say my own personal gloom, of course, is, the challenges that I faced in my own recovery.”
Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, one of the Democratic contenders for the state’s next governor, also cited “the people struggling in New Mexico” as his gloom. “The things that we need to do to make sure that they don’t continue to struggle, whether it’s education or health care and people suffering with illness that aren’t getting medical care.”

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Deputy Director of Communications Jodi McGinnis, who also is a long-time Zozobra volunteer who has worked on the seamstress team the last few years, summed up her gloom succinctly: HR1, the federal legislation otherwise known as the One Big Beautiful Act, which contains cuts to Medicaid and other programs expected to hit New Mexico particularly hard.
“I won’t call it that,” McGinnis Porter said of the “big beautiful bill” moniker. “I call it HR1, the GOP budget bill, and that’s what I put in my gloom box.” 
Santa Fe County Commissioner Justin Greene, who is running to be the next mayor of Santa Fe, also cited the federal government. “Sadly, the gloom comes from outside of Santa Fe,” he said. “Right now we have to deal with stuff on the federal level that we can’t deal with here locally.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, the Democrat who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Santa Fe, also identified the Trump administration as her gloom.

“My gloom was that we elected Trump, because all of the despair and masked men pulling people off the streets and the attack on our education and our beautiful people and culture. But you know what? Santa Fe knows how to deal with that. When he has fears, we choose joy. And when he has division, we choose community and unity, and then when he chooses darkness, we fight it with fire and light,” she said.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, also a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 gubernatorial race, said some of her gloom was the “stress of moving and packing.” As for the political climate: “The gloom  in Washington, DC.— I don’t know if there’s a Zozobra big enough to burn it up,” she said, “but the way that we fight Trump is by working hard right here in New Mexico for the people we love and care about.”

Not everyone brought gloom to burn, though. New Mexico native, retired Army Sergeant and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Leroy A. Petry, upon whom former President Barack Obama bestowed the honor in 2011 for his service in Afghanistan, said he was home to attend the celebration, and was happy to be there with his father and brothers.

“This is a childhood memory of mine,” he said. “I haven’t really been home to see my family in a long time, and it’s just such a happy day for me.” Petry, 46, added that he “let go of all my gloom a long time ago, after I got injured. I lost my hand, I got shot through my legs, I had a heart attack last year. All these challenges and adversity keep coming into my life, but every day that I wake up and I open my eyes, I know I’m blessed with another day. So I don’t carry the gloom around with me.

A handful more agencies are now under orders from the White House to terminate their collective bargaining agreements with federal unions.
In an executive order signed Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump (R) added more agencies and a few agency components to an already extensive list of federal entities slated for collective bargaining cancellations. Trump said the terminations of labor contracts are intended “to enhance the national security of the United States.”
Trump’s initial executive order from March 27 invoked a narrow, rarely used portion of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act that allows a president to suspend collective bargaining for national security purposes. The White House said the additional agencies it’s now directing to cancel collective bargaining agreements all have missions dealing with national security as well.
The agencies that Trump’s existing anti-union orders now cover are NASA; the U.S. Agency for Global Media; the National Weather Service and the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service — both within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Bureau of Reclamation’s hydropower program; and the Patent and Trademark Office’s commissioner of patents office.
Trump said in his executive order that the agencies and agency components newly tacked onto the anti-collective bargaining list all have “as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.” The agencies that Trump deemed no longer eligible for collective bargaining join many others, which the Office of Personnel Management listed out in March 27 guidance.
OPM: Trump’s hiring questions ‘mandatory’ to ask, but optional to answer

The White House did not immediately respond to Federal News Network’s request for clarification on why these specific agencies were not part of the initial March order, or why they are being added to the list at this time.
American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley said the union would have an “immediate response” to Trump’s new executive order and vowed to continue fighting in court for its members.
“This latest executive order is another clear example of retaliation against federal employee union members who have bravely stood up against his anti-worker, anti-American plan to dismantle the federal government,” Kelley said Thursday evening.
“Several agencies including NASA and the National Weather Service have already been hollowed out by reckless DOGE cuts, so for the administration to further disenfranchise the remaining workers in the name of ‘efficiency’ is immoral and abhorrent,” Kelley said.
The new executive order follows months of the Trump administration’s efforts to erode union rights for federal employees, while also overhauling civil service protections more broadly. In a fact sheet issued Thursday, the White House argued that collective bargaining at agencies dealing with national security work “can create delays in agency operations.”
“President Trump is taking action to ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their missions without delay and protect the American people,” the White House wrote. “The President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.”
Federal unions, however, have argued that collective bargaining benefits agency missions, rather than detracting from them. Many have also pointed out that Trump’s orders to cancel collective bargaining across much of the federal workforce swept up many agencies with missions that have nothing to do with national security.
Multiple federal unions, including AFGE, quickly sued the administration over the president’s actions earlier this year. While about half a dozen lawsuits remain ongoing, several agencies have already moved forward with terminating their union contracts after an appeals court decision green-lit agencies to begin implementing Trump’s orders from March.
The departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, among others, recently “de-recognized” many of their federal union chapters, revoked official time and reclaimed office space from union representatives.

Alabama was traditionally one of the South’s more unionized states, due to its long manufacturing heritage. But union membership has declined in the state. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership in Alabama declined from 156,000 workers — about 7.5% of the state’s 2.1 million workers — to 140,000, about 6.6% of the state’s workforce, in 2024.
Holton said the union has between 3,500 and 5,000 members. Its goal, he said, is to fight for the employees of the base to be “normal.”
“They’re not going to have to work double and triple and another job, and they can go spend the time watching their children play ball like everyone else in the world,” Holton said. “To be able to go out and be volunteer coaches, to be able to be someone in our community that is there all the time that are actually contributing. You’re not stuck at work all the time doing things that you don’t want to do.”
He said he is frustrated with lawmakers and politics in the South because the union is at a military base. He said it seems that Democrats are for unions, but against military growth, but Republicans are the opposite.
“What is wrong with not having to work two jobs? What’s wrong with having the ability to retire a pension plan? What is wrong with having safety standards? What is wrong with those things? It doesn’t have to be a left or a right side,” Holton said. “In my mind, it needs to be a decency side. What is decent for human beings, your people, your workers, people that are the backbone of this country?”
Holton said that there would probably be more unionization in the state if people realized that the issues unions usually fight for – fair hours and wages – are faced by their coworkers.
“I think a lot of times people forget we can grow our own allies by starting with … there’s a lot of brilliant people I know right there on the floors beside us,” Holton said. “They are working the same kind of jobs, worrying about the same things: Are they going to pay the rent or are they going to take their baby to the doctor?”
Holton’s goals at IAM are similar to those of Lance Ingwersen, the co-chair of United Campus Workers of Alabama, Local 3821 (CWA) at Jacksonville State University. The campus union launched two years ago, joining chapters at Auburn University and the University of Alabama. Since the launch, Ingwersen and his colleagues have been fighting for a livable wage for JSU’s hourly employees, per the Livable Wage Calculator by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Through that campaign, the campus’ custodial staff – among the lowest paid hourly workers, save for student workers – starting wage has increased about 15% from $9.09 per hour to $10.45 per hour, he said.
“It’s still well below the $15 and then later $17 that we’ve been pushing for those workers,” Ingwersen said. “That’s still the primary focus of our work on campus is just trying to get fairer wages for those hourly workers.”
According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a livable wage in Calhoun County, where JSU is located, for a family of three where both parents are working is $18.53 per hour.
CWA’s biggest challenge, though, is advertising its existence. Under a university policy, Ingwersen said, “Protected Expressive Activities” that are not sponsored by the university can only assemble in two places on campus.
“It’s very murky, so it’s really hard to let people know,” Ingwersen said. “We have to rely on things like social media and other stuff.”
For CWA and IAM, it has become a reminder that you should earn fair pay for the work you do.
“If a man or a woman goes, and they put in a hard day’s work, they deserve the wage that they deserve because they are the reason you are successful,” Holton said of companies.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pro-union-sign-for-Sept-25-2024-story.jpg,,,2025-09-01 08:57:02.318060

Wildfire veterans say an immigration raid last week targeting fire crews in Washington state was an alarming development that could threaten the nation’s wildfire readiness. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state last week and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotas. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid on Wednesday took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota is a good place to be a worker, with higher wages and union density than the nation along with lower unemployment. But there are growing challenges. Housing costs are rapidly increasing, child care is among the most expensive in the country, and an aging workforce threatens economic growth while straining taxpayers tasked with caring for those who need it.
President Trump’s agenda of massive federal cuts, high tariffs and immigration crackdowns has frozen the job market in uncertainty, and Minnesota’s jobless rate reached the highest level in nearly four years this summer.
Here are five charts on the state of labor in Minnesota.
Wages are higher in Minnesota than most other states


Minnesotans earn the highest average hourly wages in the Midwest — and the 8th highest in the country — while enjoying a relatively low cost of living compared to the coasts.
The average Minnesota worker earned $37.58 per hour in 2024, compared to $32.66 nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For most, that’s more than enough to meet the basic cost of living — housing, food, transportation and health care — with money left over to go out to dinner, save for retirement and take a vacation.
According to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development’s cost of living calculator, a single person with no kids needs to earn around $18 an hour while a family of four with one working parent needs to earn around $33 per hour to afford the basics.
Wages have generally matched or outpaced inflation over the past several decades. Although high inflation coming out of the pandemic eroded many workers’ buying power, wage growth has since caught up. Low-wage workers — particularly those in nursing homes and food service — benefited the most from a tight labor market, which has pushed wages up much more quickly than inflation in recent years.
Even so, rising costs for housing and child care are stretching family budgets and souring many workers’ view of the economy. The median income is enough to afford the median-priced home in the state, but rents and home prices have been rising faster than incomes.
Child care is also more expensive in Minnesota than most other states, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute. On average, infant care in Minnesota costs $22,000 per year — about 20% of the median household income.
Minnesotans are working and finding jobs
Minnesotans are working — or looking for work — at some of the highest rates in the country with a labor force participation rate of 68.2% compared to 62% nationally. Unemployment — the share of people looking for work — is also lower than the national average.
The share of adults working rose steadily through the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, as more and more women entered the workforce. Women in Minnesota work at some of the highest rates in the country, though the price of child care and persistent gender pay gap means women are more likely than men to stay at home to care for children or other family members.
The labor force participation rate has not returned to pre-pandemic levels of around 70%, in large part because many older workers retired in the pandemic and never reentered the workforce.
The continual aging of the population foreshadows difficulties in the labor market ahead. Employers will have to raise wages, but they will also need to lean into automation and hope the state can attract more out-of-state migrants or immigrants.
Union membership is high compared to the rest of the country
Minnesota consistently has among the highest rates of union representation in the country owing to its pro-labor tradition and relatively favorable organizing laws. The higher unionization rate contributes to the state’s relatively high median wages.
High union membership doesn’t just benefit union workers. Research shows that as union membership increases in a given industry, so do nonunion wages because of increased pressure on employers to raise pay.
Still, the story of unionization in Minnesota and the nation as a whole has been one of steady decline over the past half century. More than 20% of Minnesota workers were represented by a union in 1990 compared to less than 15% today.
Union leaders blame the decline on federal laws hostile to organizing and a lack of meaningful enforcement against unfair labor practices. While unions have been enjoying a surge in popularity since the pandemic, enthusiasm alone has yet to change the long-term decline of union membership.
Income inequality persists


By some measures, income inequality got worse in the pandemic years, with the top 10% of earners taking home 37% of Minnesota’s total income in 2023, up from 35% in 2020. Meanwhile, the bottom 10% of earners take home a meager 1.9% of the state’s income, a figure that has stayed more or less the same for the past decade.
Minnesota’s Gini coefficient — a metric of inequality that ranges from 0, representing exact equality, to 1, representing one person making all the money — has also gotten slightly higher in recent years but remains the same or lower than our neighboring states.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis has yet to publish state-level data on income distribution for 2024 and 2025, so we’ll have to wait to see whether high wage growth for lower-income workers will help address inequality in Minnesota.
Education, health services and construction jobs are growing
Despite a slowdown in jobs recently — with over four thousand jobs lost in July — Minnesota has seen a 1.1% increase in jobs over the past year, a little more than the nationwide 0.9%.
The highest job growth is in education, health services and construction. Elementary and secondary school employment growth is especially strong, with an 8% increase in jobs since last year. Meanwhile, the financial and information sectors have seen a loss in jobs, with the state’s telecommunications sector losing nearly 5% of its jobs, in line with national trends of layoffs at telecom companies from organizational restructuring and possibly AI automation.
Government job growth has also slowed down from last year, especially at the federal level, as Trump slimmed the federal workforce through mass buyoffs and layoffs. Minnesota’s federal workforce saw a sharp downturn in the month of April — a loss of 500 jobs — coinciding with the timing of a second wave of buyout offers from the administration.
“We may now be seeing results of mass federal layoffs and funding interruptions, erratic tariffs and shrinking immigration,” said Matt Varilek, the Commissioner of Minnesota’s Department of Employment and Economic Development, in a recent press release.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230001-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How are CT schools funded? What to know about the ECS formula,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/ct-education-cost-sharing-formula-ecs/,"Critics say the Education Cost Sharing grant, which represents CT's chief operating assistance for schools, has lagged inflation for years.","Connecticut children are now back to school and state government is making an unprecedented investment in their education this year — at first glance.
But while the Education Cost Sharing grant, the formula that represents the state’s chief operating assistance for local school districts, will dedicate almost $2.5 billion to local districts this fiscal year, more than 10% of the General Fund, critics say the program has lagged inflation for years, causing huge disparities in school funding between wealthy and poor communities to worsen. 
Here’s what you need to know about a problem that has befuddled legislators, governors and courts for decades.
How does the ECS formula work?
Though it never has created parity in school funding, the ECS formula is designed to move Connecticut closer toward equality.
And it begins with a “foundation” level, a basic assumption that it costs about $11,525 to educate one student in Connecticut.
From there, the formula adjusts this per pupil expenditure based on how many students a district serves from low-income households. It particularly focuses on pupils who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals or who speak English as a second language.
It also considers a city or town’s wealth in two ways, looking at the value of its taxable property as well as the income of its residents.
Hoping to encourage cooperation and efficiency savings, the state also provides a bonus to towns that send students to regional school districts.
Has the state always had the ECS formula?
Historically, Connecticut left cities and towns to rely chiefly on their local property taxpayers to fund K-12 education. And while the state developed some of the richest communities, and some of the poorest, in the nation, its approach to school funding remained unchanged. 
But the Connecticut Supreme Court, in its 1977 landmark ruling in Horton v. Meskill, found that dysfunctional funding system violated the right to an education guaranteed in the state Constitution. Justices also concluded, however, that creating a more equitable approach was the legislature’s job.
Anticipating this ruling, the legislature had acted in 1975 to create the first weighted state grant system, the Guaranteed Tax Base formula. It was modified into the Education Cost Sharing system in 1988, as legislators merged that program with an ongoing effort to boost teachers’ salaries statewide.
Neither the GTB nor ECS legislation guarantee that all districts would enjoy equal funding — through a combination of local property tax dollars and increasing state grants. And Connecticut never has achieved such parity.
What factors have impacted the ECS formula?
Connecticut’s pension debt often has gotten in the way of equal education funding.
Governors and legislatures dating back to the late 1930s failed to save adequately for these benefits, leaving the state billions in debt. By the 1990s, mandatory pension contributions began surging significantly, gobbling up resources that could have gone for education and other programs.
That wouldn’t stabilize until 2017, when officials began refinancing that pension debt, stretching out payment plans and pushing some debt onto future generations of taxpayers.
Lawmakers took two more key steps that same year: crafting new budget caps to increase surpluses, which would be used to pay down pension debt even faster; and ordering a multi-year plan to beef up the ECS.
But pensions got a much bigger slice of the budget pie.
Since 2017, surpluses have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year. The ECS program is up about $450 million from eight years ago, and critics say the growth is far too modest to compensate for decades of stagnant funding.
Has the ECS formula kept up with inflation?
No.
The School and State Finance Project, a Connecticut-based education policy group, estimates the ECS system would distribute an extra $99 million this fiscal year were the foundation level alone adjusted to reflect inflation.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign in March attacking Gov. Ned Lamont — a big defender of existing savings programs. CCM estimates ECS grants, adjusted for inflation, have declined by more than $400 million since Lamont took office in 2019.
“Local leaders are being asked to do more with less, and the state’s leadership needs to be honest about the challenges our communities face,” CCM Executive Director and CEO Joe DeLong said. “It’s time for real solutions that provide stable, predictable and sufficient funding for our cities and towns, not just political talking points.”
Lamont countered that he’s tried to grow both education and general government aid to municipalities while still whittling down tens of billions of dollars in pension debt that he inherited.
“My budgets prioritized significant municipal aid investments because that funding is about more than ensuring our unique towns and cities are incredible places to live, but because that funding supports our children’s education and gives them the best opportunity at the starting line in life,” Lamont said in March.
What is ‘hold harmless’ and how does it impact ECS? 
And as state officials try to balance municipal aid and pension obligations, a third issue also clouds the future of the ECS program.
Will Connecticut have to begin cutting education grants for some communities to increase them for others?
For decades, legislators and governors largely have resisted this option, even if the ECS formula called for a district to take a cut because of great wealth, declining student enrollment or a mix of factors.
This “hold harmless” approach — ensuring no district received less state funds one year than the prior year — was tested this past spring.
Lamont recommended that legislators stick to the formula they had adopted, boosting the program by more than $80 million in 2025-26 — but allowing more than 80 communities to receive less funds and collectively lose slightly less than $10 million.
But state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, asked lawmakers to keep “hold harmless” alive for now, arguing the ECS formula is flawed and would otherwise punish some many poor, rural towns in her district in New London County.
Many rural poor communities marked by high unemployment, public assistance caseloads and local property tax rates have declining student populations. But, Osten noted, most are midsized to large geographically. That means even if their schools lose some students, they can’t easily cut costs by merging classes or closing schools.
 “That’s saying those communities don’t count,” Osten said.
Legislators ultimately opted to spare those 80-plus districts from ECS cuts for another two fiscal years, but are expected to resume the “hold harmless” debate soon.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0521_SR_TeacherArrests_091-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

The agency recently issued new guidance on COVID-19 that advocates fear will lower vaccinations, though officials insist anyone who wants the vaccine can still get it. (Photo courtesy FDA)Five years after COVID-19 hit the United States, officials can largely anticipate how the virus will operate and, with available vaccines, antivirals and at-home tests, the natural seasonal rise in cases is more manageable than at the peak of the pandemic.
But public health advocates and researchers worry that recent “mixed messaging” from the federal level on who should get the new batch of COVID-19 vaccines may disrupt that progress.
“Mixed messaging results in people being confused. It will increase vaccine hesitancy and will undermine our nation’s ability to adequately protect ourselves from COVID,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “We’re seeing some confusion. I think part of the confusion is not knowing what the precise recommendations are.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved an updated COVID-19 vaccination for seniors and those with health issues that suppress their immune system – a change from previous vaccine guidance that recommended the shot for everyone older than 6 months.
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a follow-up social media post that the latest FDA approval is not “limiting availability” of the vaccine to anyone, and those who want it could still get it.
That said, it will likely be harder to get a COVID-19 shot if it’s not widely recommended, as insurance carriers may not cover the cost of the vaccine. Those who want the shot may need to go through additional administrative hurdles to get it.
“There’s a great deal of confusion and a lack of clarity about the vaccinations,” Benjamin said. “Their (FDA) communication has been so confusing that people aren’t sure quite how to get it … I don’t personally think they are following the science in their recommendations.”
Five years later, COVID-19 cases in Maryland top 1.5 million, health department reports

Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, says the new recommendations are not based on any changes in the COVID-19 virus.
“What’s changed is the political will to utilize vaccines. We have a secretary of Health and Human Services who has clearly not supported vaccines in the past,” Pekosz said of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted vaccine skeptic.
“What you’re seeing with the government recommendations now are exactly that kind of attitude,” Pekosz said.
Top medical societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, are pushing back on federal COVID recommendations. On Aug. 19, the AAP recommended that “all young children ages 6-23 months get vaccinated against COVID-19, along with older children in certain risk groups.”
“Whenever people are confused about an issue or they don’t think they understand it, the default is to not do something,” Pekosz said. “And in this case … people will not be getting the vaccine simply because they are not sure if they should or shouldn’t because of the mixed messaging.”
He noted that COVID-19 cases in Maryland are starting to rise, but other places are seeing faster increases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that COVID-19 infections were “growing or likely growing” in 31 states. That included Maryland, where the CDC reported that the number of people in emergency rooms who were diagnosed with COVID-19 remained low, but that the numbers were likely growing.
Pekosz says that while COVID-19 in 2025 is milder than it was in the early pandemic days, it is “still a severe disease,” and worries that lower vaccination rates will provide less protection for those more susceptible to severe disease – older people, children and those with weaker immune systems.
In Maryland, there had been 1,521,314 reported cases of COVID-19 through last week, according to the most recent data from the Maryland Department of Health. There were at least 18,507 deaths in the same period, the department said.

– Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who studies respiratory illnesses


Just last week, there were 1,317 active COVID-19 cases in Maryland. But weekly cases have been on a steady rise since mid-summer, when there were just 390 reported COVID-19 cases during the first week of July.
That said, fatalities attributed to COVID-19 are low. There were only three COVID-related deaths last week, according to the state health department. Since July 1, there have been 27 deaths attributed to the virus.
Pekosz said that even though the new guidelines specifically say “high risk” populations should have access to vaccines, limiting its availability to others could still end up lowering protection for the high-risk groups.
“More cases in healthy individuals will spill over into the high-risk groups,” Pekosz says. “More-vulnerable populations do not respond as well to the COVID vaccine. So while the vaccine works, it doesn’t work as well. When you vaccinate the whole population you start to generate these layers of protections.”
Pekosz expects that fewer people will get the vaccine this year due to the confusion.
He and other public health advocates await further guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine this year. Meanwhile, Pekosz recommends that Marylanders prepare for the seasonal rise in cases by picking up some at-home COVID tests. But he still says the COVID vaccine is effective and safe.
“The vaccine is efficacious, I would much rather get the vaccine than get COVID. And that is now being taken off the table for a large number of people,” he said.

I think the average general public would see it as reasonable behavior to have this unnecessary practice stopped.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Barbara Felitti: The issue of hunting over bait piles in Vermont.","This commentary is by Barbara Felitti, of Huntington.


“Blasphemy” and “sacrilegious” is how a Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department biologist described the agency’s proposed rule change to allow hunters to use a rifle or shotgun to kill antlerless deer as a means of controlling the deer population. 
The comments by Nick Fortin were an acknowledgement that, until now, existing hunting rules and cultural norms restricted killing antlerless female deer to the use of bow and arrow or muzzleloader. 
The palpable angst on the part of Fish & Wildlife about the ethics of hunting antlerless deer with rifles is at great odds with their position at a House Environment Committee hearing in February of this year against a bill, H.132, which would prohibit the use of bait as an attractant when hunting furbearing wildlife. Despite repeated questions from legislators, Fish & Wildlife would not offer an opinion about the ethics of baiting which is seen by some hunters as unsportsmanlike for providing an unfair advantage over game.
Another reason for prohibiting hunting over bait piles is public safety. Emotional testimony was presented to the committee from people who lost their dog after it was attracted to and shot over a bait pile. Despite this, the response from Fish & Wildlife’s interim commissioner was that the issue is “nuanced” and the onus to address it should not be put solely on people who use bait piles.
To be clear, Fish & Wildlife acknowledged that they do not know how many furbearers are killed over bait piles every year or how many hunters use bait piles as there are no reporting requirements for the practice. Without this information, there is no meaningful way to assess the legitimacy and ethics of using bait piles as a hunting practice. Fish & Wildlife also failed to answer a question about how important hunting over bait piles is to managing wildlife populations such as coyotes.
Nonetheless, Fish & Wildlife sees it as more important to allow use of an unspecified number of bait piles by an unknown number of hunters rather than address the known safety issue of bait piles causing the death of people’s dogs. Fish & Wildlife expressed no problem with continuing to allow people to shoot from their homes out at a bait pile in the daytime or nighttime. 
Fish & Wildlife staff claim to “try to deal with the issue of safety and what normal people would, average people would, consider reasonable behavior on the part of the hunting community.” I think the average general public would see it as reasonable behavior to have this unnecessary practice stopped.
In 2022, Vermont passed the wanton waste bill, which bans the intentional killing of wildlife without a useful purpose. It resulted in bans on practices such as animal killing contests. It banned this form of hunting not because there was a conservation issue, but because there was a social values issue that indiscriminate killing of wildlife was offensive to the general public.  
Baiting is similarly offensive and unnecessary. At a minimum, Fish & Wildlife could have declined to support the bill or at least not oppose it. Instead, they put their support behind an unknown number of hunters who use bait piles at the expense of safety to the general public and their pets.
Once again, Fish & Wildlife is showing itself to be oblivious to the general public on wildlife issues. 
Back in 1984, the name was changed from the Department of Fish & Game to the Department of Fish & Wildlife. Perhaps it is time to revert back to “Fish & Game” so we are honest about whose interests are being served.

(Photo by edb3_16/Getty Images)A $1.5 billion project to bury a 1-foot-thick and 100-mile-long high voltage power transmission line under the Columbia River turned down fast-tracked federal permitting approval offered by a Trump administration executive order earlier this summer.
Although the Cascade Renewable Transmission System project will move through a slower federal permitting process, it has to wait for permits from Oregon and Washington anyway. But this track may avoid alienating the two blue states.
“We chose to go with the standard process,” said Chris Hocker, the project’s lead and a senior vice president for PowerBridge, the project’s parent company.
“We felt that simply asking for this expedited approval wouldn’t necessarily have any impact on what the states would be doing in terms of their review authority,” he added. “And so we saw very little advantage, and we thought it might undermine the coordinated effort.”
Hocker said PowerBridge also picked the standard federal permitting process because of the complexity of the project, which will bury a transmission line 10 to 15 feet under a giant river between two states, and will require tribal consultation.
A Reuters news analysis last week said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers invoked President Donald Trump’s order declaring a national energy emergency to expedite the project.
But Kerry Solan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Portland District, said in an email that was wrong and added the project had opted out of the “emergency processing procedures.”
Bypassing bottlenecks
The project aims to beef up power transmission infrastructure between where electricity is generated east of the Cascades and where it’s consumed, which is in population centers along the Interstate 5 corridor. It would also move power past transmission bottlenecks in Portland to an important north-south high voltage transmission route and to data centers on the city’s west side, Hocker said.
The project comes at a time when power planners say the region is in desperate need of power and power lines to move it. The region has less available power as clean energy laws in Washington and Oregon increasingly block fossil-fuel-generated electricity. Meanwhile, power demand is expected to potentially double in coming decades because of growing consumption from data centers, as well as home and vehicle electrification.
“More transmission is absolutely needed, whether it’s our project or anybody else’s project,” Hocker said.
Not without a fight
While the Cascade Renewable Transmission project between The Dalles and the Vancouver-Portland area has come at an opportune time, that doesn’t mean it has a clear path to approval.
“Columbia Riverkeeper does have major concerns about this project — specifically, the short-term and long-term environmental impacts of dredging a giant trench through the river and the impacts to aquatic species,” said Teryn Yazdani, a staff attorney for the organization.
Yazdani also fears the project would set a precedent, eventually turning the river — which is already pushed to its limits by power infrastructure — into a utility highway.
The proposed transmission project also stands to harm tribes’ treaty-protected fishing rights and sovereignty, said Julie Carter, a lawyer and longtime policy analyst for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission.
“It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” she said. “They want to dig into critical habitat — habitat that’s needed for … salmon and steelhead, for Pacific lamprey.”
Carter said she worries in particular about lamprey, a species Native nations in the Columbia Basin have worked hard to save. So little is known about lamprey that the project could dig its channel right into the middle of their migration route.
Carter said PowerBridge hasn’t released enough specifics about the project for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission to fully understand its impacts.
“There’s so many questions for us that we’re just scratching our heads,” Carter said.
Permitting march
The Corps echoed that sentiment earlier this year when it said the project’s permitting applications didn’t have enough information.
But Hocker said PowerBridge has since provided the Corps more details and the federal agency has started consulting with regional Native nations about the proposed project.
“It’s really up to the Corps to determine the next steps, but I expect that they will need to delve further into the environmental impacts of the project,” he said.
Solan of the Corps said the agency currently considers the application closed.
“We are working with the applicant to obtain additional information necessary for us to move forward with a thorough review and evaluation,” she said.
On the state permitting front, the project expects to submit siting applications to Washington and Oregon “in the next month or so,” Hocker said.
“It’s been the product of a lot of work and a lot of studies in an attempt to answer the many questions that arise for a project like this, particularly one that has never been considered in the region,” he said.
If all goes well, Hocker said the process will take a couple more years before the project can break ground.

(Photo from the Indiana Historical Society)Everyone loves a parade, as the old adage goes, and in 1886 the Knights of Labor certainly hoped this would prove true when they planned the first Labor Day celebration in Indianapolis. 
With one of the nation’s largest concentrations of union members, the city was ripe to embrace the relatively new tradition of Labor Day parades which had begun four years earlier in New York. But the city’s first attempt at a march that would continue off and on for the next 139 years was less than auspicious.
Originally set for the first Monday in September, the event was moved to September 19 to accommodate the speakers’ schedules. But the turnout was lower than expected due to heavy rainfall, and because the rescheduled date fell on a Sunday, local pastors condemned the event from the pulpit.
The celebration the following year initially looked more promising after Mayor Caleb Denny issued a proclamation asking businesses to close so their employees could watch the parade. But attitudes toward the event turned sour when most of the honorary marshalls turned out to be lawyers and politicians, leaving the actual working men and women to trail behind.
Despite these early bumps in the parade route, the popularity of Labor Day continued to grow, and in 1891 the legislature made Labor Day a state holiday, to be celebrated each year on the first Monday in September. Congress followed suit three years later. With the official recognition of Labor Day as a time for America to recognize the contributions made by its workers, Indiana began planning a day-long celebration that would kick off with a parade and end with an actual bang.

Thousands of spectators lined the streets on September 3, 1894 to watch union members decked out in the uniforms of their trades march from downtown to Lincoln Park at 16th Street and Central. Picnics, speeches and a band concert followed. And then, as dusk fell, everyone flocked to a makeshift arena to watch a performance of the Last Days of Pompeii.
Have we forgotten the true meaning of Labor Day?

Although on its face a play about a volcano that wiped out an entire city would seem to have little to do with a celebration of America’s workers, the performance was nonetheless a hit. Local dancers who had trained at the Statehouse swept across a stage that fronted a manmade lake and a replica of Pompeii with Mount Vesuvius looming in the background. As the performance drew to a close, the volcano belched black smoke and the buildings crumpled in flames, endangering a few spectators who were sitting too close to the stage. 
Then, to the audience’s delight, a dazzling display of fireworks was launched into the night sky, creating a variety of shapes that included an elephant and the American flag. 
In the ensuing years, Labor Day parades continued to grow in popularity as Indianapolis cemented its position as the Labor Capital of America. The city’s central location and easy access by railroad attracted the national headquarters of at least 12 labor unions and was the base of operations for several legendary labor leaders.
In 1922, some 7,500 union workers marched through the streets in what organizers called the largest Labor Day parade ever held in Indianapolis. But the following year, the parade was rained out, and for the next 14 years, Labor Day would come and go without any official celebrations due in part to anti-labor sentiment and the Great Depression.
The parade tradition was briefly revived in the late 1930s, only to be disappear again during WWII when factories needed to remain open. Then in 1949, the Indianapolis News declared that Labor Day parades were a thing of the past, a remnant of the time when workers marched through the streets to call attention to the struggles of labor. 
Indeed. By 1951 the only Labor Day parade in Indy was Sear’s Parade of Values, featuring deep discounts on refrigerators and mattresses.
In 1982, the city’s first Labor Day parade in 40 years filled the streets with marchers from 100 different labor organizations. Seven years later, the parade that initially scorned the inclusion of politicians welcomed Gov. Evan Bayh as its grand marshall. Then in 2012, the parade finally reached the end of its route when it was replaced with the Indianapolis Labor Fest.
But 130 miles north of Indianapolis, the news of the death of the Labor Day parade apparently failed to reach the small town of Lowell. Now in its 106th year, the Lowell event is the longest continuously running Labor Day parade in Indiana.

They designed a self-driving rescue vehicle to help. (Photo provided by Clemson University.A group of Clemson University engineering students watched the nonstop news last September as Helene tore a path of death and destruction through the Carolinas and Tennessee. 
The raging floodwaters that isolated the storm’s victims prompted them to question: What if a team of medics could have driven into mountain towns and far-flung homesteads with a Humvee loaded with supplies? And what if they could have sent the vehicle back on its own to transport injured and rescued passengers?
That was the inspiration behind the latest research project conducted by students in the Upstate university’s Deep Orange program.
A team of 17 students equipped a self-driving vehicle that could be deployed by search and rescue teams.

“This is really important, because in a rescue situation, you obviously want to get to people as quickly as possible. And if you have any injured people, you want to get them out of harm’s way as quickly as possible,” said automotive engineering professor Rob Prucka. “So that’s the kind of work that we’re trying to do.”
Prucka is the director of the Deep Orange program, which has an ongoing, autonomous vehicle research partnership with the U.S. Army.
The project, completed this past spring, marks the 16th iteration of Deep Orange, in which industry leaders give each cohort of students a problem to solve during the course of their studies.
That’s why the vehicle was dubbed Deep Orange 16.
“Deep Orange pushes us to think like real-world engineers,” said team leader Rohit Godse, who graduated in August with a master’s degree in automotive engineering. “We are not just learning theory, but solving complex, high-stakes problems that prepare us to lead in the industry from day one.”
“We’re trying to produce engineers that will be valuable to the auto industry the day they leave Clemson,” Prucka added.

The program also seeks to test technological advancements that automakers or the military may one day use — in this case, a rescue vehicle controlled by software that could be used in combat or stateside during a natural disaster.
One thing Prucka said the team heard over and over from first responders they interviewed is many never know the situation they’re walking into until they get there. They have maybe half the information they need. And it may or may not be correct. So, they need a vehicle that’s ready for anything.
“And maybe the car itself could be an extra helping hand,” Prucka said.
One of the new capabilities the team added to the off-road vehicle included camera systems for looking ahead and sensors for scanning the ground. The vehicle could then use its computing systems to analyze those images and readings on the fly and automatically adjust its suspension accordingly to create a smoother ride.
Those same camera and sensor systems also map the route in, so the vehicle can travel back out without someone controlling it from the driver’s seat.
And in off-road situations, visibility becomes an added challenge.
“If you crest a hill, you can’t usually see over the hill,” Prucka said. “If you’re in a really rocky train, you can’t always tell what exactly a tire is going to run over.”
A 360-degree view from the cameras reduces the number of blind spots operators might have.

Finally, while less high tech, students designed a stretcher-loading mechanism for the back of the vehicle to lift injured passengers.
“On the surface it looks simple in a way,” Prucka said. “But it’s intentional because the soldiers all said this thing needs to work every time. It can’t be complicated. But it does help some challenges that they have actually loading patients into the vehicle, especially, when they’re under distress.”
“Our students are not only driving innovation — they’re helping to save lives by improving how we respond to emergencies in the most challenging environments,” Prucka added.
Deep Orange 16 will remain at Clemson as a prototype.
Future classes will continue to test and improve the technology that could eventually be used in rescue operations.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DO16-Hero-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

Second-grade teacher Demetria Richardson spends so much on school supplies she has a designated credit card to cover classroom expenses. Just don’t tell her husband what the balance is, she said. Usually, the 26-year veteran educator in Richmond, Virginia, spends about $500 on back-to-school items. Over the past month, she has already topped that — and she’s not done shopping.
Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that lets individuals fund public school classroom projects, helps Richardson cover some of the costs on items like dry erase markers, pencils and printer ink. The school supply-stuffed backpacks that local churches distribute to families before the school year also help, Richardson said. Yet, none of this assistance stretches far enough to prevent teachers like her from dipping into their own wallets to serve students.
While covering the cost of classroom supplies is a challenge educators face annually, the burden on them has grown as the price of many learning materials has jumped by 20 percent in roughly five years.
“By the end of September,” Richardson estimated, the total on her credit card for school is “probably going to be close to $1,200.”
President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods — and the supply chain disruptions that resulted — have partly been blamed for driving up the cost of school supplies. His freeze of over $6 billion in education funding on July 1, which he reversed before the end of that month, added to the problem by preventing schools, including Title I schools with large populations of economically disadvantaged students, from stocking classrooms with learning materials well ahead of the academic year.



This story was originally reported by Nadra Nittle of The 19th*.			


“It’s hard to understand that teachers have to buy all these supplies for themselves, for their classrooms and for students,” said Emma García, principal researcher for the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit that conducts research to improve education policy and practice. “I don’t think there’s any other profession in which the professional has to shoulder the supplies or the materials. But for teachers, it’s taken for granted that they will be there, that they are going to do the work no matter what.”
Research indicates that virtually no educators are spared from spending their own money on their classrooms, according to García. Teachers at high-poverty schools told The 19th that, in addition to Trump’s tariffs and funding freeze, other factors have contributed to them paying more for goods. They pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, when they saw prices start to rise and a cultural and economic shift in which students returned to class with few to no supplies, a trend they say persists today.
“This year has definitely been a huge challenge because typically the schools would be able to give us some of the basics, like a stapler, pencils, paper,” said Emmanuela Louis, who teaches English Language Arts for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. School officials “haven’t been able to give us anything, so it’s like we have to rely heavily on DonorsChoose to even get resources for the kids to start the school year. It pretty much puts the most vulnerable kids at risk.”
Through it all, teachers have served as the safety net children can count on when the system breaks down. Educators have taken on debt, found extra work and gone without much-needed personal items to prepare their classrooms — and their students — for another school year.
The personal sacrifices behind classroom supplies
For Richardson, shelling out hundreds of dollars of her own money on school supplies means she won’t be able to buy the $150 pair of stylish Vionic orthopedic shoes that make it easier for her to stand all day.
“People think that we don’t like to look nice, too,” Richardson said. “We want to get a new back-to-school outfit, too, or a pair of shoes. But when it comes to our students, our students come first, and we go on the back burner.”
Louis knows the feeling: Some years she has barely been able to afford back-to-school footwear and apparel herself. During others, she has gone without these items entirely because she had funneled so much money into her classroom at Jose De Diego Middle School in Miami. Although her district provides her with a $300 school supply stipend, a purchase as mundane as copy paper devours those funds instantly, she said.
No more school textbook bills for Indiana parents — but what other fees can still be charged?

“Three hundred dollars doesn’t go far at all,” said Louis, who has taught for 16 years. “When you’re thinking of supplies — folders and things like that — they’re not cheap. You’re buying at least three folders per student just to keep their items organized. Paper is also a necessity to copy things for them. We do have laptops, which kind of helps, but they don’t always go home with them, so they definitely need tangible items in their hands to write and copy things down.”
Altogether, Louis estimates that during any given school year, she spends about $2,500 to $3,000 on her classroom and students. And that doesn’t include the money the mother of two spends on supplies for her own children, a third-grader and a ninth-grader.
Richardson’s classroom expenditures aren’t far behind, as she has spent as much as $2,000 outfitting her classroom at Henry L. Marsh III Elementary in Richmond throughout the school year. That’s well above the average educators spend on supplies, DonorsChoose has found, backing up previous research that revealed teachers at high-needs schools have more out-of-pocket expenses.
“We ran a teacher survey earlier this spring, and we noticed that teachers are spending, on average, $655 of their own money on school supplies for their students and for their classroom,” said Kristina “Steen” Joye Lyles, vice president of equity and impact at DonorsChoose. “That’s an increase from what teachers reported last year, which was $610.”
Without DonorsChoose, Lyles said, teachers reported that they’d be spending over $1,400 of their own money on school supplies annually. “So, this is a trend that we’re watching closely.”
García said paying for school supplies compounds financial pressures for teachers, who earn lower salaries compared with professionals in other careers that require college or graduate degrees. Moreover, teachers often take on student loan debt just to enter the field. Given this, any out-of-pocket costs are “going to be more burdensome for a teacher than for a non-teacher” covering work-related expenses, García contends. And the $300 deduction for classroom expenditures educators can claim on federal income tax returns hardly levels the playing field.
Richardson has felt obligated to subsidize her students’ needs with her own money because she teaches at a Title I school where nearly every pupil qualifies for free or reduced lunch. Some years, most of her classroom expenses have gone toward snacks for students.
“Some parents send their own snacks, but we do have a lot of kids whose parents don’t, so we hate to see them sitting there needing that extra boost of energy but not having it,” she said. “You’re talking about snacks for maybe 20 kids, five times a week. That does add up.”
Also adding up is the rising cost of school supplies. This year, Richardson has paid more for crayons, glue sticks, composition books, folders and other materials than she remembers paying in recent years.
“I used to get folders for 50 cents apiece,” she said. “Now they’re almost 95 cents a folder. We used to be able to get boxes of crayons, but we can’t get them in bulk at the dollar store anymore. They said supply is low. Now, they’re like almost $2 for a 16-count box.”
Louis can no longer afford to give each of her 125 students a small box of crayons, along with a kit filled with rulers, index cards and highlighters. This year, she said, groups of four students will have to share these school supply kits. Sharing them means that her students can’t take the kits home to complete their schoolwork.



				Indiana educators are eligible for a $100 tax credit for classroom supplies. 			


Since her students are required to wear uniforms consisting of polo shirts and navy or khaki pants, Louis has also spent her own money to make sure her sixth graders, many of whom come from migrant families who can’t afford more than one uniform, have multiple sets of these clothing items.
“The uniforms have gone up tremendously,” she said. “It used to cost $6 or $7 for a shirt. Now they’re between $9 to $12.”
As classes resumed in Richmond, Richardson had already spent $200 on composition books and $400 on durable headphones for her students that wouldn’t break like the cheap ones she had in her classroom last school year. New whiteboards and dry erase markers were also on her list.
A mother of four — the youngest of which is a college senior in need of her own supplies — Richardson said she’s fortunate enough to have children who pitch in to help her obtain learning materials.
“They always say, ‘Hey, Mom, I picked up some crayons for you,’ or ‘Mom, I picked up some pencils. Mom, you always said the kids never have scissors,’” Richardon said. “I’m so blessed that they do look out for me.”
The empty backpack: a post COVID reality
Reflecting on the start of her teaching career, which coincided with the turn of the 21st century, Richardson noticed a stark difference compared with today in how parents respond to the annual supply list her school sends out.
“Earlier in my career, parents would send everything on the school supply list, and then they would send extras just in case,” she said. “If your tissue box supply ran low, you could reach out and they would replenish it.”
Today, however, students will get free bookbags from community events and bring nothing more than the bag and the supplies in it — usually one notebook, one pack of paper, one box of crayons — to school with them, Richardson said.
“If we’re lucky, that’s what they have,” she said.
Out of 125 students, Louis said that she expects “maybe not even 20 percent” to show up to school with the supplies they need. That’s about 25 students.
The COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point, ushering in mass job losses and supply chain disruptions that made it difficult for families to pay for essentials like rent and food, let alone school supplies. When students returned to class after remote learning, many stopped bringing the items on supply lists, teachers told The 19th.
“So we tried to minimize what was on the list to be just the necessities,” Richardson said.
At her high-poverty school, most students show up with half the supplies on the back-to-school list, while about a quarter arrive completely empty-handed, she said. Some parents question why students need items like resealable plastic baggies, dry-erase markers or hand sanitizer, so they don’t purchase them. Others just haven’t been able to find items on the supply list, like the clear or mesh book bags required since July 2024 by Richmond Public Schools.
To supplement her income and easily provide her students with the appropriate learning materials, Richardson has in the past taken on extra work — teaching summer school and working as a tutor and facilitator. Doing so, she said, gave her “extra money all year round to offset what I spend in my classroom.” A DonorsChoose survey revealed that nearly half of teachers report having a second job.

“So, again, we’re just seeing this heightened level of teachers going above and beyond to be able to stay afloat during a time when things are getting really expensive,” Lyles said.
Jodi Hanauer, an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) teacher at Juniata Park Academy in Philadelphia, has previously picked up more work, which, in part, helped her buy school supplies.
“I took on a part-time job just to pay the bills for several years,” the 22-year educator said. “I was an online ESOL teacher at night and during the weekends. I was teaching kids and adults English in countries like China, Japan and [places like] Hong Kong.”
The extra income she earned then marked the rare time buying school supplies, for which Hanauer pays between $500 to $1,000 annually, didn’t hurt financially. Like Louis, her school district provides her with a small stipend to cover learning materials, but the $200 doesn’t begin to compensate for the expenditures she makes working at a high-poverty school.
Title I funds from the federal government help schools with economically disadvantaged students to cover supply costs.  But Trump’s funding freeze in July held up Title I funding, delaying schools from getting their supply orders processed well before the new academic year.
“We haven’t been able to receive the order for this school year yet, so we’re hoping that will get cleared up soon,” Richardson said.
A stopgap, not a solution
DonorsChoose helps teachers like Richardson avoid financial collapse.
She’s currently seeking donations for basic school supplies like pencils and ink for the classroom printer. She’d also like clay to help her students do classroom projects that develop their fine motor skills.
But DonorsChoose, Richardson said, is not a permanent solution to the long-standing pattern of teachers covering school supplies.
“It takes a while for the projects to be funded and then the materials to be shipped to us,” she said. “If we need poster boards for our students to do a history project, and we need them in the classroom on Friday, I have to go out and purchase 18 poster boards to make sure that all of my students have one.”
For Hanauer, DonorsChoose is no guarantee she will get all the school supplies she needs. She currently has a campaign to give prizes — which have previously included fidget spinners and high-end pens, pencils and erasers — to students who make positive behavioral choices.
“Putting up a DonorsChoose project is like a dream,” she said. “You are dreaming of getting things, and it’s great if that happens, but if you absolutely need something now or in one week, then you’re going to have to come up with the money yourself.”
For 12 years, Louis has used DonorsChoose to subsidize her classroom expenses. Since many of her students are English learners, it’s imperative that her classroom be a print-rich environment. But educational posters can cost $35 apiece, an expense that can quickly balloon. Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose has helped her cut down on these costs. She’s also used the site to fund field trips. She’s currently crowdfunding for a file cabinet and poster machine ink that can cost up to $500.
Although teachers make countless sacrifices to kick off the school year and maintain their classrooms as the months unfold, Louis knows that the public is largely unaware of how much educators personally contribute to school supply lists. Every item in a classroom, she said, has been designed with one goal in mind: facilitating student learning.
“So, please be gentle with teachers,” she asked, urging families to provide any learning materials they’re capable of buying. Teachers who pour money into their classrooms, she said,  do so “out of the kindness of our heart, because we really enjoy what we do.”

(Getty Images)When organic wheat farmer Joel Huesby was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s in southeast Washington, many teens sought jobs in the region’s vegetable canneries. He, his wife, his sister-in-law and many friends all worked in a cannery and then each June joined other teens around Walla Walla picking strawberries. 
“It was kind of like a rite of passage,” said Huesby. But while he enjoys reminiscing, he also acknowledges that it would be impractical for today’s farmers to depend on teens and other amateurs to pick their crops.
It was nearly as impractical back in the 1960s when Congress canceled the guest worker program to make room for more American workers in agriculture. The temporary worker program was established during World War I as a solution to labor shortages. The program closed in 1922 but was brought back in 1942, with a focus on Mexican farmworkers spending part of the year in the United States. 
It continued to evolve until 1964, when foreign workers made up nearly half the American farm workforce. At that time, Congress shuttered the program and encouraged American youth to be patriotic and work in the fields. And those American teens were about as enthusiastic for agricultural work as the farmers were about hiring them.
“That’s not today’s agriculture,” says Huesby. “You need the people to come onto the big farms … and basically follow the seasons north. That’s a completely different world.”
American agriculture has changed a lot since the mid-20th century. And the challenges farmers face today are different as well. The list is long. In addition to ongoing labor issues, there are stagnant commodity prices, rising equipment and transportation costs, tariffs, unevenly distributed government subsidies and federal programs that stop and start government distribution of surplus crops.
People following politics closely may be focused on the ways Trump administration policies on immigration and tariffs are making life more difficult for farmers. But Washington growers say the main challenges they face go back a lot further than the 2024 election.
‘Our growers are running out of time’
Huesby, who identifies as conservative politically, says American farmers can’t succeed without guest workers and immigrants. He says Americans who grew up in this country are not raised for agricultural jobs. 
“They don’t have the work ethic. They’re soft. They don’t have the muscle memory,” he said. Huesby doesn’t hire seasonal workers for his small organic wheat farm, but his neighbors do and they talk. 
They worry about what might happen to the current guest worker program and whether farmworkers from Mexico and Central America will continue to come to the United States for seasonal work if they think they could be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a church or the grocery store, even though they are in this country legally.
Washington fruit growers lived with those fears this summer when, thanks to great weather, they saw one of the best cherry crops they’ve had in years. 
Mark Powers, president of the Northwest Horticultural Council, said the organization, which works with tree fruit growers, is concerned about the news coming out of the other Washington. But the industry’s No. 1 issue is labor and as it has been for years, he said.
While trade and tariffs both get more attention from the public, labor and regulatory issues have been haunting cherry, apple and pear growers for more than a decade.
“Growers focus on growing excellent fruit. That’s their day job. But increasingly, growers have to wear a lot of different hats,” Powers said. 
Those include regulatory compliance, managing guest workers, OSHA and food safety. Escalation in wages and compliance issues at both the federal and state levels apply most of the pressure. Remember those old movies and books that make farming seem like an easygoing, idyllic life? I’m not sure if it ever was, but Powers assures me it certainly isn’t today. 
“Every year, the anxiety, the concerns, and now in some cases fear, ratchets up,” Powers said. He adds: There’s no sign on the horizon that rising costs will level off.
He notes that Washington farmworker wages have gone up at least 48% since 2017, but a glance at state income statistics shows that is true for all wages in the state, not just farm wages. While this is a challenge for all employers, most have increased their prices to keep up with rising costs. But Powers and others maintain that isn’t as simple with food and commodity prices. 
Apple prices, for example, have not increased 48% since 2017. The Federal Research Bank of St. Louis tracks consumer and commodity prices, and they report that apple prices have risen about 20% during that same time period, with some ups and downs depending on apple varieties and other circumstances like the weather. Just for comparison, the cost to rent an apartment in Seattle went up more than 90% during the past decade. 
“People can manage around that to a certain degree for a limited amount of time. Our growers are running out of time,” Powers said. 
Domestic labor shortages are adding complexity and cost. More fruit growers are now depending on the H-2A visa program, also known as the guest worker program, for seasonal farmworkers. 
Between 2017 and 2024, the number of H-2A workers brought into Washington state increased from approximately 18,800 workers to roughly 36,000. That increases farm labor costs – because farmers have to provide housing and transportation for these guest workers – and total labor expenses are getting out of reach for small family farms, Powers said. 
The program may also be making it harder for farmers to attract local workers since they do not have to provide housing for non-migrant labor and there’s a higher hourly wage required for H-2A workers – $19.82, versus the state minimum wage of $16.66. These disparities are also leading to dissatisfaction among the local workers, according to farm labor advocates.
‘If it had been up to the Northwest, we would have had a solution’
The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides money to farmers to keep them in business despite price and expense fluctuations, but the system is considered imperfect by some and unfair by others. 
Huesby, the wheat farmer, is not a big fan of farm subsidies. He calls them “subsidized crop insurance,” and notes that 10% of farms get 80% of the subsidies. Part of the reason for the disparity is how complex the government programs are. Only farms that afford someone to do all the extra paperwork can get their hands on this money, he says, noting, “I’m a farmer of the soil. I’m not a farmer of computer programs.”
It doesn’t matter your politics, Huesby says. Both conservative and liberal farmers have something to say about U.S. agriculture subsidies, which most lawmakers are reluctant to cut or reform because farm lobbies in Washington, D.C., are so strong. Huesby, who is not shy about expressing his political views, says this is one of the reasons he thinks congressmen should not turn public service into a lifetime career. 
Powers believes both immigration reform and agriculture policy reform could provide some relief. He says both state leaders and central Washington’s representative in Congress, Rep. Dan Newhouse, are working toward solutions.
“If it had been up to the Northwest, we would have had a solution,” Powers said, noting this is a big country with diverse opinions on both topics and that’s one reason why these reforms are taking so long.
Newhouse has proposed several bills to protect American farms and is working with a bipartisan coalition on a proposal to modernize the guest worker program, to provide a steady immigrant workforce for American farms. Washington state lawmakers have been working with agriculture industry leaders to find a way to pay farmworkers a good wage while keeping farmers in business and their crops harvested.
A coalition of farmers and farmworkers are also working together on these challenges. Save Family Farming, based in Everson, Washington, reported earlier this summer during the cherry harvest that the federal immigration crackdown was leaving some farms without the labor they needed to harvest their fruit. 
While local workers were worried about being targeted by ICE agents, some migrant workers were also staying away, said Erik Zavala, director of field staff at Wenatchee-based Blue Bird, Inc., a cooperative of small family farms. They heard on social media that farmworkers were warning the migrants to avoid Washington because ICE was conducting raids at orchards. 
No actual raids were reported by Washington farmers, but the fear was enough to keep workers away.
Fear is a major factor in many of the threats affecting Pacific Northwest agriculture. For example, Washington fruit growers export 25-30% of their crop and the threat of rising tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s trade wars have added to farmers’ uncertainty. Tariffs may eventually affect equipment costs and parts to repair equipment – one more thing to worry about.
Growers have started to leave the industry, Powers said.
According to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service’s Census of Agriculture, Washington tree farms actively producing a crop decreased by 15 percent between 2017 and 2022. But Powers said that number has gone down since then. The USDA reports the number of Oregon apple farms decreased by 26.6 percent, pear farms by 27 percent, and sweet cherry farms by 28.9 percent between 2017 and 2022.
Huesby wraps up all the challenges facing farmers into six words: “You can’t do business with instability.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/palouse-combine-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

Texts, emails and audio obtained via public records requests provide further insight into the conflict between Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and Glover’s select board.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How a dirt road became a small-town spectacle involving Vermont’s lieutenant governor.","GLOVER — To an outsider, Rodgers Road seems like one of hundreds of unremarkable dirt roads in Vermont. The road, which stretches for over a mile, is surrounded by towering green trees and sprawling farmland. It passes by a cemetery holding the gravestones of families that have called this small Northeast Kingdom town home for generations.But the road is also at the center of an increasingly personal, yearslong ownership dispute between Vermont’s Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and the town of Glover’s leadership and employees. The town considers all of Rodgers Road to be a town highway — Town Highway 48, specifically. Meanwhile, Rodgers says a three-quarter mile portion along which he lives and farms is actually private and belongs to him. 
Rodgers Road — named after the lieutenant governor’s family, who have owned the property for close to two centuries — makes an almost 90 degree turn, creating a wonky square with the equally rural Andersonville Road and Daniels Pond Road. Both of those roads are Class 3, meaning that under Vermont law they must be maintained year-round. That classification continues past the intersection onto Rodgers Road for roughly one-third of a mile. The remainder of Rodgers Road is considered Class 4, which doesn’t require year-round maintenance. This is the contentious section, currently the subject of a lawsuit that Rodgers filed against the town last month.  
Rodgers says his family has always owned the road section. Glover, on the other hand, says the town has always owned the section. The legal dispute started in 2023. 
That was about a year before Rodgers announced his decision to run for the state’s second highest office and 18 months since he had last represented the region in the state Legislature. Elected in 2002 as a state representative for Glover and surrounding towns, Rodgers later also served as a state senator, in both offices as a Democrat. He changed parties before accepting the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in 2024. 
On June 12, 2023, according to public records obtained by VTDigger, Rodgers emailed then-Glover Selectboard member Leanne Harple — now herself serving as the town’s state representative — requesting that no work be done on the Class 4 section of Rodgers Road, until the question of ownership is answered. 
Earlier that day, Rodgers had stopped Mike Pray, a member of the Glover road crew, from putting in a new culvert on that section of the road. 
“I would ask that until this legal issue has been resolved that No town action is taken on the class for [sic] section of the road,” Rodgers wrote in the email, obtained via the public records request.
Rodgers went on to say he was considering closing the road to through traffic once his right to do so was affirmed. “I could close the road and make the town higher [sic] a legal team to find evidence of their right of way if I decided to go that direction,” he wrote. “I would rather not.”
“My intention is that if my legal team is correct that I will eventually close the road to car and truck traffic but would leave it open to all pedestrian bicycle ATV in UTV used as a Trail,” Rodgers added.When Harple forwarded Rodgers’ email to Pray and other Glover officials — asking if work could pause until the legal issue had been resolved — Pray shared his version of events.“I was greeted with John [Rodgers] walking up to me in the excavator calling me a moron, and was told if I do any work on the Class 4 … that cops would be called,” Pray wrote. 
Later in the email thread, then-selectboard member David Simmons said he didn’t see a reason to give up the road. 
“Calling Mike a Fucking moron is nothing more than him being a bully,” he wrote.
The disagreement was just starting to heat up.

Town records and road crew
A few weeks later, on July 17, 2023, Rodgers found himself in front of the Glover Selectboard, arguing his case.
“I asked the town about giving [Rodger’s Road] up, they didn’t seem like they were going to negotiate,” Rodgers said at the meeting, according to audio obtained by VTDigger. “So I got a hold of a lawyer and a researcher. And from our preliminary research, there is no record of layout, no record of dedication and acceptance, two major hurdles for the town.”
In response, Nick Ecker-Racz, a former selectboard member who gained extensive knowledge about Glover roads and their history helping put together various maps for town use, disagreed, stating Rodgers’ researcher was “mistaken.” 
After some polite chatter, Rodgers brought up the conflict that had occurred between himself and Pray on June 12. Rodgers also accused Scott Pray, another member of the Glover road crew, of “coming at” him with a grader, and stated the town had made a “huge mistake” hiring the Prays to the road crew. 
The meeting then devolved into an argument between Rodgers and the road crew. 

Following the meeting, Glover Selectboard members sent Rodgers a letter stating: “Last night’s Select Board meeting was uncomfortable and upsetting … Somehow, we need to find a way to de-escalate the tension that exists now between you and our town employees.”A key theme in the Rodgers Road dispute has been the strained relationship between Rodgers and Glover’s road crew, particularly  Scott and Mike Pray — who are father and son, respectively. Their clashes often got personal. 
Rodgers and his wife, Brenda Rodgers, both accused Glover road crew members of trying to run them off of the road multiple times according to letters written by the couple to the Glover selectboard. The letters were written following a request by Harple, who asked the couple via email on July 18 to write down their experiences with the road crew.Brenda’s letter recounted a time she was driving home from work on July 13, 2023, and “had to almost come to a complete stop as the grader came slightly over the middle of the road onto my side,” she wrote. “I was sure he was going to hit me. I was scared for my life and hope nothing like that ever happens again. I feel unsafe driving these town roads.”John’s letter accused the Prays of trying to run him off the road on the same day. Rodgers also accused Scott Pray of attempting to run him off the road in spring 2023 while the latter was doing maintenance on Parker Road.“I came around the sharp corner and met Scott on the grader,” John Rodgers wrote. “At first he made a quick steer to the right to give the approaching vehicle more room but when he saw that it was me he made a quick steer back toward me and continue[d] to crowd me off the road.”
Mike and Scott Pray responded with their own letters, denying the Rodgers’ accusations.“I have no recollection of ever swerving at anyone ever while operating the grader,” Scott Pray wrote. “As far as Brenda’s accusation I truly do not know what she drives or what she looks like.” 
Mike Pray wrote that he had “no recollection of myself, or any town employees swerving, veering or trying to run John Rodgers, Brenda Rodgers or anyone else [off the road] while maintaining and performing our duties, or for any other reason in the Town of Glover.”
On Dec. 5, 2023, after the road crew had plowed his road later than he expected following a snow storm, Rodgers wrote about the escalating frustration he felt with the road crew in an email to selectboard members Harple and Phil Young.“My family has nearly 200 years of service to this town and a reputation for being honest, hard-working people that help everybody out,” he wrote. “I have over 20 years of public service serving this town and this area. To have these lowlifes discriminating against me, is a serious slap in the face.”

A complex controversy
Between January 2024 and April 2025, the road dispute cooled off from its prior fever pitch. During that time, Rodgers ran for lieutenant governor and won the race against a seated incumbent, a rarity in Vermont politics. He was formally sworn into that office in January 2025 after a vote by the full Legislature, required because neither candidate had won a majority in the fall race. 
But a number of actions in the spring — including a select board meeting and stories run by WCAX, one of Vermont’s local television news stations — brought the issue to the attention of Vermonters, some of them just getting to know their new lieutenant governor.
At a May 8 select board meeting, Rodgers, who joined via Zoom, again threatened legal action against the town and said he would shut the road to through traffic, according to reporting by WCAX.
“The reason I would like to be able to negotiate something that the town could support is because if we don’t, then we’re both gonna spend a ton more money on lawyers,” Rodgers said at that meeting according to audio obtained by VTDigger. “If I win, I’m going to shut the road down completely. There’ll be no access. If you win, you’re going to spend a whole bunch of money on lawyers and then have to spend money fixing up the road and maintaining it forever.”

At least one select board member sympathized with the lieutenant governor’s position. 
In a Facebook comment on the WCAX story, select board member Anne Eldridge defended Rodgers against others commenters who accused him of taking advantage of his statewide office to make a land grab against the town.“Regardless of my position, I’m still just one voter and citizen in this town. I consider John a friend, and am absolutely sympathetic to his, and his family’s, concerns,” Eldridge wrote. 
The television segment “indeed showed a very limited view of a complex and long-standing controversy,” she said in the social media post. “I don’t personally agree with the comments saying this is any kind of abuse of power – he has every right to make his case as a resident, and we have an obligation to hear out and address the concerns of our constituents.”At the May 8 meeting, select board members discussed getting input from others living on Rodgers Road. In response, some Glover residents began organizing a petition to keep all of Rodgers Road a town highway.Twelve Glover residents, most of whom live or own property on or near the road, signed the petition. Two notable names on the list were Jim and Nancy Rodgers — John Rodgers’ uncle and aunt, who lived in Rodgers’ current home for decades until they sold it to him in 2019. The couple still live on the road, in a home nearby. Prior to the sale, Rodgers lived on a road next to Rodgers Road.In a May 19 letter to the Glover Select Board, resident Elizabeth Nelson argued that if the Class 4 section of the road “ceases to be a public through highway, it will make access for agricultural or residential use impossible to my property. It will also significantly affect my property value.”Nella and James Coe, two longtime Glover residents who run an architecture firm and whose property touches Rodgers Road, were lead circulators of the petition.“Currently, a corner of our property adjoins Rodgers Road. If it was all privatized, we’d lose access,” James Coe told VTDigger.

The petition was presented at a May 22 select board meeting, attended by over 40 people.
Jim Rodgers, John Rodgers’ uncle, came to the meeting to voice his opposition at the idea of his nephew owning the road.“We’re against it. We’re living on a Class 4 road, and we would be land-locked if that was shut off,” Jim Rodgers said. “To put it bluntly, it’s silly. It’s plain stupid. That’s my opinion.”At the meeting, the select board unanimously voted to officially keep all of Rodgers Road part of Town Highway 48, allowing the road crew to continue to work on and maintain the road.“Now, the war begins,” one select board member said moments after the vote.
On June 4, select board member Glenn Gage emailed Mike Pray, alleging that when Gage went to visit Rodgers Road to check on the work the road crew did, the lieutenant governor was “confrontational about what was going on, mainly about WCAX being involved. He says it was an inside job that got this story leaked. I assured him that it was not, but he has made his mind up over that part.”On June 11, John and Brenda Rodgers filed suit against the town, requesting a preliminary injunction to prevent Glover from performing planned work on the disputed section of Rodgers Road. They also asked the court to determine who owns the Class 4 section of the road. A hearing for the case is scheduled for October.
To bolster the lawsuit, the lieutenant governor hired a surveyor, who in an affidavit stated that there has never been a record that establishes the town’s ownership of the disputed section of Rodgers Road.Ecker-Racz, the former select board member, disputed that conclusion, providing VTDigger with a 19th-century document that he says shows maintenance work was done on the road by a town road worker before it was owned by the Rodgers family. 
James Ehlers, Rodgers’ chief of staff, declined to comment on the Rodgers Road dispute because the matter was making its way through the court, and referred all questions to the lieutenant governor’s legal representation.“We assert that the Town never lawfully established the disputed section of Rodgers Road as a legal town highway,” Michael Tarrant, one of Rodgers’ lawyers told VTDigger this week. “We believe that a segment that runs through their property has always been and remains their private property.”Tarrant also rebuked the idea of Rodgers shuttering the road to public access.“If we prevail in this case, the result would not be that the Rodgers will have ‘taken back’ or ‘privatized’ this disputed segment,” Tarrant wrote. “Rather, the Court would confirm that this portion of the road never belonged to the Town to begin with — and public access has and will remain within the discretion of the Rodgers.”
The Coes, who are co-chairs of the Glover Planning Commission, said the lawsuit has put a strain on town resources.“We are on the planning commission, and we have had to stop pursuing some projects because this is happening,” Nella said. “Anything that is raised, that we’d like to do, we are being told … there is no money and it’s not an option to even ask for it, because that would just cause stress to the town.”Despite the friction the road dispute has caused between Rodgers and town officials, Nella said it has also had a surprisingly positive effect on Glover residents.“Its kind of brought people together. It’s been cool in that way,” she said. “… I’m sorry to say this, but they’re kind of laughing about it.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. On this Labor Day, as the Trump administration systematically attacks workers and undercuts labor rights, it is not enough for the labor movement to oppose what is happening. 
While resistance is essential, we must also chart a path forward — one that clearly articulates what we stand for and the future we are building. A future where all workers — working people of all identities, backgrounds, education, ability, size, expression and status — feel safety, security and solidarity from their union and labor movement.
Local union members recently created an agenda called “Our Shared Vision for Workers’ Rights and Economic Justice” that is the result of listening to workers who understand firsthand what working people need to thrive. 
Working people are clear on what a just economy looks like. With this agenda, we have concrete steps to achieve it. Our shared vision rejects the false choice between economic growth and worker rights, recognizing that strong workers and strong communities are the foundation of a strong economy.
The vision addresses urgent realities facing workers today. Despite increased productivity year after year, working people are not sharing in the fruits of their labor. Workers across essential services burn out at unprecedented rates due to understaffing. These are symptoms of an economic system that prioritizes short-term profits over human dignity.
We call on employers to support workers and labor rights
Our agenda calls on employers to take concrete action to support their employees. Even as the federal administration takes extreme steps to strip workers of their labor rights, employers have the ability and the obligation to respect workers’ right to organize without interference and to bargain in good faith. We are demanding employers honor workers’ right to respect picket lines without disciplinary action. When labor laws are stacked against workers, striking workers need to be able to access their collective power.
We are demanding safe staffing ratios in essential institutions so workers do not have to choose between providing quality services and their own well-being. We are calling for workplaces free from immigration enforcement intimidation. We call on employers to provide workers with accessible comprehensive health care including gender-affirming care, expanded diversity and equity initiatives, and robust protection of organizing rights.
But we are not just asking — we are acting. The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO is committed to mobilizing the labor movement to support efforts to bargain these provisions into union contracts.
Government policies should support economic justice
We are calling for a minimum wage that is actually a living wage — one that allows working people to support their families.
America’s crumbling infrastructure represents both crisis and opportunity, creating good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced while building reliable systems communities depend on. Our country needs massive investment in job-creating infrastructure programs that hire local union workers. 
We need reasonable caps limiting CEO pay to sensible multiples of median worker wages. When CEOs earn hundreds of times more than their workers, it reflects priorities that value shareholder profits over people who actually do the work and create value.
Our vision includes guaranteeing universal paid time off, providing unemployment insurance for striking workers, requiring prevailing wage and labor peace agreements on publicly-funded projects, transitioning to a single-payer health care system, fully funding public education and protecting due process in immigration.
At a time when many people feel disconnected from politics, public leaders seeking labor’s support must demonstrate commitment to this comprehensive vision for economic and racial justice for all working people. 
This vision represents more than policy proposals — it is a framework for building a society that values the humanity, dignity and contributions of all working people. While the current administration is attacking the foundations of worker rights, we refuse to only play defense. In this critical moment, we are stepping forward with a comprehensive vision that benefits not just union members, but all working families.
We can create communities where families thrive and feel safe, where workers have power and voice, and where prosperity is shared by all who contribute to our collective success. 
This Labor Day, as we celebrate the contributions and dignity of working people, we offer more than recognition — we offer a path forward. This is our shared vision, this is our call to action, and this is our Labor Day commitment to building the future that we all deserve.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1127927-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-01 07:56:30.471085

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 28, 2025.
It started with a pair of ripped ski pants.
During the pandemic, Kate Harvey and her family were living in Connecticut but, like many southern New Englanders, looked north to get outdoors during the isolation. She was skiing with her son in southern Vermont when her pants ripped on the lift. They were beyond mending, but she followed her son’s youthful interest in taking things apart to see how they work. After dissembling the pants, she used the parts to make small pouches.
“It was just little zip pouches that Teddy would put his money in, and he would bring them to school, and so then his buddies would be like, ‘Oh, those are so cool.’ And then their moms would ask about them,” Harvey said.
Fast forward a few years and Harvey’s budding BirdieBlue business is partnering with apparel makers like Burton in Burlington and Turtle Fur — located nearby in Morrisville — and others to turn worn out ski jackets and snow pants into boutique fanny packs and tote bags.
It was clear to Harvey that Vermont would be an ideal place to run such a business, with its proximity to skiing-adjacent and outdoors-focused business communities, and to the material she sought to repurpose. Her husband’s flexible job as head of sales for a medical technology company allowed the family to relocate.
“We decided it’s our happy place. It’s where we wanted to be,” Harvey said. “We were a little bit of the Covid cliche, I guess, but we found that this was just an incredibly supportive community. I almost think that if I hadn’t started this fully in Vermont, there’s no way this would have been successful.”

From a workshop crowded with bags of used cold-weather clothing in an industrial area on Old Creamery Road — along the Morrisville bypass — Harvey and assistant Allegra Sargent wash loads of worn-out jackets and pants before cutting them apart and reassembling them into fanny packs, tote bags and toiletry bags. These bags are sold directly to consumers through the BirdieBlue online retail shop, but they’ve also been proliferating in local retailers in Morrisville and Stowe, and even in places like REI stores in Williston and New Hampshire.
Harvey partnered with designers to first produce the fanny pack ($58), which was the shop’s flagship product, before moving onto the toiletry bag ($58) and totes ($110).
The fanny pack comes in three-panel colorways, and over time Harvey has gauged the popularity of certain color combinations.
Harvey started the business with the pitch that 92 million tons of textile waste is produced globally, and she presumed there would be a market for people who wanted to dispose of their clothing as ethically as possible.
“We started really with thinking, let’s create a program where just any skier — an individual mom who’s got a kid at an outdoor preschool that has totally unusable gear at the end of the season — we can just create a program where you can send us your gear for free, and then you get a discount code, or we can make something out of it for you,” Harvey said.
BirdieBlue will be relaunching the program soon in anticipation of a busy holiday season. The program was also how Harvey got connected with Burton.
“They kind of heard what I was doing, and they were a great case study in the fact that gear companies were looking for something to do with all this gear that was going in the garbage,” Harvey said. “We’re providing an opportunity to be a collaborator, not a competitor, where we’ll take the gear, we’ll create something.”
This has led to an expanded retail presence, but also partnerships with ski patrols at places like Stowe Mountain Resort and Bolton Valley Resort.

This two-women operation is how most of the work gets done. Harvey travels to events in Vermont and beyond to spread the gospel of her upcycled accessories, which are assembled by hand. In July, she received a $25,000 grant from a nonprofit funding women whose businesses address sustainability and the environment. She invested it in a used cutting machine to make the process more efficient.
BirdieBlue went from making a couple bags a week to hundreds of bags a month, scaling with the help of a domestic network of sewing factories. But like many U.S.-based manufacturers who do most of their manufacturing and source most of their materials in the country, it hasn’t been possible to insulate the business entirely from the vagaries of the global economy and the Trump administration’s tariffs, even while limiting the parts she sources from Asian countries.
“U.S. producers are like, ‘Well, wait a minute. China’s now charging this much more. We can match that now,’” Harvey said. “This whole idea of tariffs injecting money into the U.S. economy is total bulls**t, to be honest. Where we need more investment is grants and workforce development and education.”
At the end of the day, Harvey said her path to growth has been not just about how she makes her clothes, but how she tells the story of how and why she makes them that way.
“One thing that I’ve really realized is building the community drives the sales, because it is really about the story,” Harvey said. “I mean, we’re not mass producing. It truly takes time, like a lever is cutting every single jacket by hand, so I think once we get in front of people and they really understand what we’re doing, they buy into the story.”

The new law, which went into effect last week, eliminates what’s commonly known as the “luxury” state sales tax rate of 4.225% on these products and reduces it to 1.225%, the same rate at which necessities such as groceries are taxed. 
After years of bipartisan support for eliminating this luxury tax in Missouri, the new law finally got across the finish line in May as part of a larger bill that repealed the state’s capital gains tax. 
Incontinence products for babies, children and adults are included in the exemption, as are products used during menstruation, including period “cups” and period underwear.
Heading into the 2025 legislative session, Missouri was one of about two dozen states with the inflated tax on diapers still in place and one of 19 states with a luxury tax on period products. This year it joined Alabama in eliminating both.
“Imagine the need for sanitary products being called a luxury,” state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, said during a House committee hearing this spring. “Any of us who has experienced such a luxury once a month would argue strongly against that being the case.” 
Advocates for the elimination of this tax on diapers and period products often cite the exclusion of products such as Viagra, which treats erectile dysfunction, from the luxury tax.
Trish Vincent, director of the Missouri Department of Revenue, said in a statement that the change “provides meaningful relief for Missouri families.”

This year, Missouri had the greatest number of state legislators working to eliminate the diaper tax, with 17 pieces of legislation proposed, according to the National Diaper Bank Network’s legislation tracker. 
In 2024, nearly half of U.S. families with children younger than 4 who were wearing diapers reported experiencing diaper insecurity, according to a study published in May by the National Diaper Bank Network and the marketing research group YouGov. 
Of those experiencing diaper insecurity, 79% of mothers surveyed said they felt stressed or anxious about potentially being unable to afford diapers, which also contributed to feelings of loneliness and fears about the future.
The St. Louis Area Diaper Bank called the new law a “monumental win for families across Missouri.”
An estimated one in four parents experiencing diaper insecurity reported missing an average of five days of school or work a month because they didn’t have enough diapers and therefore couldn’t drop their child off at day care, where parents are typically required to provide their own diapers, according to the network.
Lack of access to period products also contributes to missed school and work for countless American girls and women every year. The Alliance for Period Supplies estimates two in five people struggle to afford period supplies. 
State Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat and a proponent of eliminating the diaper and period product taxes, also filed legislation aimed at requiring public schools to provide free period products to students beginning in fourth grade.

Adaptive bikes are typically custom built with a range of different components and configurations. They can cost up to $25,000, which is where organizations like Green Mountain Adaptive Sports and the Kelly Brush Foundation come in.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Aug. 28, 2025.
Carol Weaver has been riding a specialized mountain bike for most of her life.
She was born with cerebral palsy, a condition that affected all four of her limbs. A few years ago, she suffered a riding accident that left her paralyzed from the chest down.
Most riders would have abandoned the sport at that point, but Weaver doubled down in order to combat creeping feelings of depression. Today she lives near a network of accessible trails in Maine and rides two to three times a week, but it was sometimes difficult for her to find a cycling community and trails that suited her needs.
A few years ago, Weaver began traveling to Stowe for an annual group ride in Cady Hill Forest, a destination for adaptive-ready terrain. This year’s ride, organized in partnership with Green Mountain Adaptive Sports, was held last weekend and featured 24 athletes from all over New England.
“These events are a big deal,” Weaver said. “Getting out on the trail and letting the public see us out there sends an important message that people with disabilities can live active, full lives. It’s good for our mental health. It’s also a good way to see how different riders tackle the trail.”

On Saturday, August 23, a handful of two-wheeled guides led adaptive riders through Cady Hill, and on Sunday, several of them competed in the Race To The Top of Vermont, a foot and cycling race to the top of Mount Mansfield. Weaver took first among the adaptive riders, an annual goal of hers.
Adaptive bikes are typically custom built with a range of different components and configurations. They can cost up to $25,000, but organizations like Green Mountain Adaptive Sports and the Kelly Brush Foundation help riders purchase a bike.
Weaver’s bike was built by ReActive Adaptations, complete with three wheels — two up front and one behind — three sets of shocks and brakes, and hand pedals to move the machine. Her model, the Hammerhead, places riders in a prone position, but models like the Nuke are operated from a recumbent position. Sometimes a bike shop will work on an adaptive bike, but Weaver said she does all her own mechanic work.
It’s a misnomer that adaptive riders require special trails to ride, Weaver said — all they really need is three feet of clearance for the front wheels and relatively even ground. Many trails in Stowe already meet that requirement, but the Stowe Trails Partnership has been working for years to further expand adaptive trails.

Stowe currently has about seven miles of adaptive-ready terrain, most of which are in Cady Hill, according to Kenzie Brunner, director of the Stowe Trails Partnership. Before her current role, she worked for the Vermont Mountain Biking Association, taking annual inventories of adaptive terrain in Vermont. She said Stowe always came out on top.
The town has been expanding terrain since taking an adaptive trail assessment in 2020. Converting an adaptive-ready trail mostly involves widening the trail and features like bridges and berms
Charlies Bypass and Eagle Ridge in Cady Hill saw the biggest renovations, and Brunner said the organization might expand adaptive terrain in the Kirchner Woods over the coming years. Stowe Trails is also building a new adaptive and beginner-friendly trail behind the Village Inn, which should be ready by October.
“We aren’t dumbing down the trail,” Brunner said. “There’s some terrain my adaptive friends will fly over that I won’t even touch.”
Still, Weaver said they appreciated having guides who knew the trails and could call out potential hazards. Jeff Kauffman, a Stowe Trails Partnership member, was one of the guides for the event. He knows the trails like the back of his hand and was happy to facilitate the adaptive group ride.
“It takes a lot of courage to get out there,” Kauffman said, “It was really nice to see able-bodied riders cheer them on last weekend.”

Kennedy Jr. testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building earlier this year in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images).The Make America Healthy Again movement has generated a lot of discussion about public health. But the language MAHA proponents use to describe health and disease has also raised concerns among the disability and chronic illness communities.
I’m a researcher studying the rhetoric of health and medicine – and, specifically, the rhetoric of risk. This means I analyze the language used by public officials, institutions, health care providers and other groups in discussing health risks to decode the underlying beliefs and assumptions that can affect both policy and public sentiment about health issues.
As a scholar of rhetoric and the mother of an autistic child, in the language of MAHA I hear a disregard for the humanity of people with disabilities and a shift from supporting them to blaming them for their needs.
Such language goes all the way up to the MAHA movement’s highest-level leader, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is clearly evident in the report on children’s health published in May 2025 by the MAHA Commission, which was established by President Donald Trump and is led by Kennedy, as well as in the MAHA Commission’s follow-up draft recommendations, leaked on Aug. 15, 2025.
Like many people, I worry that the MAHA Commission’s rhetoric may signal a coming shift in how the federal government views the needs of people with disabilities – and its responsibilities for meeting them.
 Personal choice in health

One key concept for understanding the MAHA movement’s rhetoric, introduced by a prominent sociologist named Ulrich Beck, is what sociologists now call individualization of risk. Beck argued that modern societies and governments frame almost all health risks as being about personal choice and responsibility. That approach obscures how policies made by large institutions – such as governments, for example – constrain the choices that people are able to make.
In other words, governments and other institutions tend to focus on the choices that individuals make to intentionally deflect from their own responsibility for the other risk factors. The consequence, in many cases, is that the institution is off the hook for any responsibility for negative outcomes.
Beck, writing in 1986, pointed to nuclear plants in the Soviet Union as an example. People who lived near them reported health issues that they suspected were caused by radiation. But the government denied the existence of any evidence linking their woes to radiation exposure, implying that lifestyle choices were to blame. Some scholars have identified a similar dynamic in the U.S. today, where the government emphasizes personal responsibility while downplaying the effects of public policy on health outcomes.
 A shift in responsibility

Such a shift in responsibility is evident in how MAHA proponents, including Kennedy, discuss chronic illness and disabilities – in particular, autism.
In its May 2025 report on children’s health, the MAHA Commission describes the administration’s views on chronic diseases in children. The report notes that the increased prevalence in “obesity, diabetes, neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, mental health, autoimmune disorders and allergies” are “preventable trends.” It also frames the “major drivers” of these trends as “the food children are eating, the chemicals they are exposed to, the medications they are taking, and various changes to their lifestyle and behavior, particularly those related to physical activity, sleep and the use of technology.”
Notably, it makes no mention of systemic problems, such as limited access to nutritious food, poor air quality and lack of access to health care, despite strong evidence for the enormous contributions these factors make to children’s health. And regarding neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, it makes no mention of genetics, even though decades of research has found that genetics accounts for most of the risk of developing autism.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with studying the environmental factors that might contribute to autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In fact, many researchers believe that autism is caused by complex interactions between genes and environmental factors. But here’s where Beck’s concept of individualization becomes revealing: While the government is clearly not responsible for the genetic causes of chronic diseases, this narrow focus on lifestyle and environmental factors implies that autism can be prevented if these factors are altered or eliminated.
While this may sound like great news, there are a couple of problems. First, it’s simply not true. Second, the Trump administration and Kennedy have canceled tens of millions of dollars in research funding for autism – including on environmental causes – replacing it with an initiative with an unclear review process. This is an unusual move if the goal is to identify and mitigate environmental risk factors And finally, the government could use this claim to justify removing federally funded support systems that are essential for the well-being of autistic people and their families – and instead focus all its efforts on eliminating processed foods, toxins and vaccines.
People with autism and their families are already carrying a tremendous financial burden, even with the current sources of available support. Cuts to Medicaid and other fundingcould transfer the responsibility for therapies and other needs to individual families, leaving many of them to struggle with paying their medical bills. But it could also threaten the existence of an entire network of health care providers that people with disabilities rely on.
Even more worrisome is the implication that autism is a kind of damage caused by the environment rather than one of many normal variations in human neurological diversity – framing people with autism as a problem that society must solve.
 How language encodes value judgments

Such logic sets off alarm bells for anyone familiar with the history of eugenics, a movement that began with the idea of improving America by making its people healthier and quickly evolved to make judgments about who is and is not fit to participate in society.
Kennedy has espoused this view of autism throughout his career, even recently claiming that people with autism “will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem.”
Even if organic foods and a toxin-free household were the answer to reducing the prevalence of autism, the leaked MAHA Commission strategy report steers clear of recommending government regulation in industries such as food and agriculture, which would be needed to make these options affordable and widely available.
Instead, MAHA’s supposed interventions would remain lifestyle choices – and expensive ones, at that – left for individual families to make for themselves.
 Just asking questions

Kennedy and other MAHA proponents also employ another powerful rhetorical tactic: raising questions about topics that have already reached a scientific consensus. This tactic frames such questions as pursuits of truth, but their purpose is actually to create doubt. This tactic, too, is evident in the MAHA Commission’s reports.
This practice of “just asking questions” while ignoring already established answers is widely referred to as “sealioning.” The tactic, named for a notorious sea lion in an online comic called Wondermark, is considered a form of harassment. Like much of the rhetoric of the anti-vaccine movement, it
serves to undermine public trust in science and medicine. This is partly due to a widespread misunderstanding of scientific research – for example, understanding that scientific disagreement does not necessarily indicate that science as a process is flawed.
MAHA rhetoric thus continues a troubling trend in the anti-vaccine movement of calling all of science and Western medicine into question in order to further a specific agenda, regardless of the risks to public health.
The MAHA Commission’s goals are almost universally appealing – healthier food, healthier kids and a healthier environment for all Americans. But analyzing what is implied, minimized or left out entirely can illuminate a much more complex political and social agenda.

Every year since 1996, the High Road Strategy Center, a University of Wisconsin-Madison nonprofit think tank, produces the report to present information on the state of work and jobs, including who is “winning” and “being left out” of the economy, though future reports may be in trouble. 
Laura Dresser, a co-author of the report and High Road Strategy Center associate director, said in a statement that the 2025 data shows “some real strengths for working Wisconsin owing to the strong recovery from pandemic shutdowns.” 
“Long-standing inequalities are still with us, and federal policy puts substantial clouds on the horizon,” Dresser said. “I’m especially concerned about the administration’s attacks on the integrity of federal economic data.”
 Laura Dresser
Joel Rogers, director of the center and a UW-Madison professor, and Leslie Vasquez, outreach specialist and communications director, are also authors of the report that was released the Friday before Labor Day. 
Dresser’s concern about federal jobs data stems from President Donald Trump’s decision last month to remove Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from her position after a dismal jobs report that showed hiring slowed in July and was weaker in May and June than previously reported. He falsely claimed the reports were rigged as his justification. 
The report warns that the approach being taken by Trump is a “disaster for economic decision making and for public trust.” 
“Good economic decisions require reliable data,” the authors stated in the report. “Without reliable independent data, we cannot understand the economy nor, more narrowly, can the High Road Strategy Center continue confidently producing reports that draw on it. With hopes for continued national commitment to reliable data, and fears about the quality of what politically motivated ‘revisions’ will do, we will anxiously monitor changes in leadership and data at the BLS.”
Wage median reaches high, gaps ongoing 
The report found the median wage for Wisconsin workers — $25.01 per hour — reached a record high for the second year in a row, though the report says this doesn’t represent the full story when it comes to workers’ wages. 
While Wisconsin’s median wage reached a new high, a difference in wages exists among workers based on gender, race and ethnicity. Men’s median wage — $27.05 — in 2024 was more than $4 per hour higher than women’s median of $22.97, a 15% difference. 
When race is considered, the differences become more stark. White men have the highest wages at a median of $28.54 per hour. The median for white women was about 17% less at $23.66 per hour. 
The median wages for workers of color fell considerably below that of white men and women. Black men and women had about the same hourly median wage at $19.93 and $20.29 — 29% less than white men. Hispanic men had a median wage of $18.56 and Hispanic women a median of $17.57.
The report also found that over 800,000 workers — nearly a third of Wisconsin’s workforce — make less than $20 per hour. 
The report says raising the minimum wage would be one way to help close these gaps. Wisconsin’s minimum wage is currently $7.25, a number in line with the federal minimum wage and that has been unchanged since 2009. 
“Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would not only be politically popular but would directly or indirectly raise the wages of 231,800 (or 18%) of women workers, 36,200 (or 25.6%) Black workers, and 50,200 (or 26.6%) Hispanic workers in the state,” the report states. 
In response to the report, Peter Rickman, president and business manager of the Milwaukee Area Service & Hospitality Workers (MASH) Union, also urged Wisconsin lawmakers to make increasing the state’s wages a priority this fall.
“The service and hospitality working class needs comprehensive living wage legislation with a $20 per hour floor, yearly adjustment for inflation, reduction of the tip penalty, and restoration of local control,” Rickman said. “Democrats and Republicans alike tell us that they want to represent the working class. Now is their time to show us by introducing and passing comprehensive living wage legislation.”
Meanwhile, Wisconsin reached a record of 3,058,500 jobs in July, but the state’s overall jobs growth has been weak. 
Wisconsin has added about 1,400 jobs per month in 2025 — growing about half as fast as the national rate. According to the report, the state has 2% more jobs than before the pandemic, while the U.S. overall has seen 5% more jobs. 
Unemployment remains low in Wisconsin with a 3.1% rate in July 2025. Wisconsin also has a 66.4% labor force participation rate, higher than the national average of 62.6%. 
“The jobs and unemployment data are strong, but the economy is cooling off after the rapid recovery from pandemic shutdowns,” the report states. 
It also finds the economic softening mirrors the national environment where analysts have warned of a slow down or even a recession.
Federal policies undermine growth 
Federal policy changes under the Trump administration are contributing to these outlooks, according to the report.
“For workers, the warning signs and the brewing economic storm of tariffs, immigration crackdowns and federal disinvestment are especially concerning,” the report states. “While the current labor market is solid, these substantial disruptions may not only slow our overall economic growth, but also reduce the power of working people, as opportunities become more scarce.”
The report predicts that tariffs, which are taxes on imports to the U.S., will raise the price of goods for American consumers, the Trump administration’s deportation agenda will undermine the country’s economic strength by hobbling jobs growth and federal cuts to social safety nets will hit the state’s low-wage workers hardest. 
“Economists and investors have observed that immigration changes may constrain economic growth even more than the high cost of tariffs. Employers are already complaining about the impact of the raids on their workforce and customers,” the report states. 
According to the report, 320,000 immigrants reside in Wisconsin and generate $23 billion in economic output annually. In 2023, federal data found that immigrants constituted 7% of Wisconsin’s workforce. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in Wisconsin have doubled under the Trump administration, and of late, the administration, which promised to focus on “criminals,” has been shifting towards deporting people with no criminal convictions and no pending criminal charges. 
“Despite considerable economic and cultural contributions, immigrants face persistent barriers to fully participating in the workforce and community life,” the report states. “The current administration’s anti-immigrant policies have increased fear and dampened new immigration, constricting the Wisconsin economy where labor markets are already tight.”
The Trump administration has also approved cuts to federal Medicaid and food assistance programs, which Gov. Tony Evers’ administration estimates could cost Wisconsin over $284 million and puts thousands at risk of losing support.
“The federal budget, enacted this summer, contains hundreds of provisions with disturbing implications for working people. It holds enormous tax breaks for the rich,” the report states, noting that an analysis by the Institute Taxation and Economic Policy Wisconsin found the “annual tax break to Wisconsin’s richest 1% will be $67,000. And the tax break for the bottom fifth of households in the state? Just $70.” 
“All of this, and more, is coming and will hit lower wage working families across the state especially hard,” the report states. 
The upheaval in federal policies also comes as participation in unions in Wisconsin, which the report says helps with improving conditions for workers, are down as a result of state policies. 
From 2011 to 2024, unionization in Wisconsin fell from 14% to 7%. Over the same time period, union coverage nationally only fell two percentage points from 13% to 11%. 
That drop in Wisconsin, the report notes, comes after over a decade of public sector unions being disempowered in Wisconsin by Act 10, the state law signed by former Gov. Scott Walker in 2011 that significantly reduced collective bargaining powers of public sector employees. 
In addition, the Trump administration has targeted unions, ending collective bargaining for a million federal employees — four out of five federal workers represented by unions at over a dozen federal agencies. He has also fired members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the agency tasked with protecting labor rights, for “unduly disfavoring the interests of employers.” 
“Despite federal and state policies that have impeded unionization over the last half century,” the report states, “unions continue to provide workers with the means to improve wages and working conditions in their jobs.”

Most of the world observes International Workers’ Day on May 1 or the first Monday in May each year, but not the United States and Canada. Instead, Americans and Canadians have celebrated Labor Day as a national holiday on the first Monday in September since 1894, 12 years after the first observance of Labor Day in New York City.
The celebrations aren’t the same.
In much of Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the event commonly called May Day honors workers’ political and economic power, often with demonstrations by socialist or workers’ parties and tributes to national labor rights. America’s Labor Day features labor union parades in many places, but for most Americans, it’s less about organized labor and more about barbecues, beach days and back-to-school sales.
Both holidays, however, arose during the same period, in the U.S. nearly 150 years ago, in the midst of an explosive labor uprising in America’s industrial heartland. Their founding united native-born and immigrant workers in an extraordinary alliance to demand an eight-hour workday at a time when American workers toiled an average of 10 or more hours daily, six days a week.
The call for shorter hours was rooted in a big idea: that workers’ days belonged to them, even if employers owned their workplaces and paid for their work. That idea inspired the loftiest goals of a growing labor movement that spanned from Chicago and New York to Stockholm and Saint Petersburg. And the labor activism of the late 1800s still casts a distant light on Labor Day today, carrying a vital message about the struggle for control of workers’ daily lives.
I’m a historian at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I study the history of labor. The fight for shorter hours is no longer a top issue for organized labor in the U.S.. But it was a crusade for the eight-hour day that brought together the diverse coalition of labor groups that created Labor Day and May Day in the 1880s.

Labor Day’s radical roots
Led by socialist-leaning trade unions, Labor Day’s founders included skilled, native-born craft workers defending control over their trades, immigrant laborers seeking relief from daylong drudgery, and revolutionary anarchists who saw the quest for control of the workers’ day as a step toward seizing factories and smashing the state.
They originally chose Sept. 5, 1882, for the first Labor Day to coincide with a general assembly in New York City of what was then the largest and broadest association of American workers, the Knights of Labor. Two years later, labor leaders moved the annual event to the first Monday in September, giving the majority of workers a two-day weekend for the first time.
As Labor Day parades and picnics spread, many American cities and states soon made it an official holiday. But since few employers gave workers the day off in its early years, Labor Day likewise became “a virtual one-day general strike in many cities,” according to historians Michael Kazin and Steven Ross.
American roots of May Day
My students come from working-class, mostly immigrant families, and Chicago’s history of labor conflict is all around our downtown campus in the heart of what were once meatpacking plants, stockyards and crowded immigrant neighborhoods.
My office is about 12 blocks from the spot – surrounded today by upscale office buildings – where the eight-hour movement reached a bloody climax in the battle of Haymarket Square. May Day commemorates that battle.
On May 1, 1886, unions of skilled workers organized by their crafts or trades led a nationwide general strike for the eight-hour day. They were joined by radical socialists, militant anarchists and many members of the Knights of Labor. More than 100,000 workers took part across the country.
The most dramatic demonstrations happened in Chicago, which had become the second-largest city in the U.S. after years of swift growth. Nearly 40,000 striking Chicago workers shut down much of that burgeoning industrial, agricultural and commercial hub. Three days later, a bomb thrown at a rally in Haymarket Square killed seven police officers, sparking a sweeping nationwide crackdown on labor activism.
In 1889, socialist trade unions and workers’ parties, meeting in Paris for the first congress of a new Socialist International, proclaimed May 1 an international workers’ holiday. They were partly following the lead of the new American Federation of Labor, which had called for renewed strikes on the anniversary of the 1886 action.
And they were honoring the memory of the eight labor activists who had been tried and convicted for the Haymarket bombing solely on the basis of their speeches and radical politics, in what was widely viewed as a rigged trial. Four “Haymarket martyrs” had been hanged and a fifth died by suicide before he could be executed.

An earlier labor win
Though May 1 had long been associated with European celebrations of springtime, its modern meaning has deeper American roots that precede the Haymarket tragedy. It was on that date in 1867 that workers in Chicago celebrated an earlier victory.
At the end of the Civil War, campaigns for an eight-hour workday arose in cities across the country, championing a common interpretation of the abolition of slavery: for many workers, emancipation meant that employers purchased only their labor, not their lives.
Employers might monopolize workers’ means of making a living, but not their hours and days.
The movement led to laws declaring an eight-hour day in six states, including Illinois, where the new rule went into effect on May 1, 1867. But employers widely disobeyed or circumvented the laws, and states failed to enforce them while they lasted, so workers continued to struggle for a shorter workday.
Seizing the day
In the 19th century, American workers’ labor came to be measured by how long they worked and how much they were paid. While they were divided by their widely different wages, they were united by the generally uniform hours at each workplace.
The demand for a shorter workday without a pay cut was designed to appeal to all wage earners no matter who they were, where they were from, or what they did for a living.
Labor leaders said shorter hours meant employers would have to hire more people, creating jobs and boosting hourly pay. Spending less time on the job would enable workers to become bigger consumers, spurring economic growth.
Having “eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, and eight hours for what we will,” a popular labor movement refrain, would also leave more time for education, organization and political action.
Most broadly, the fight for shorter hours encapsulated workers’ struggle to control their own time, both on and off the job. That far-reaching struggle included efforts to limit the number of years people spent earning a living by ending child labor and creating pensions for retired workers – a topic I’m currently researching.
Benjamin Franklin famously said, “Time is money,” meaning that time off costs money that workers could be making on the job. But the message of the movement for a shorter workday was that the worth of workers’ lives could not be calculated in dollars and cents.
Diverging holidays
In the Haymarket battle’s aftermath, the alliance of radicals and reformers, factory operatives and skilled artisans, U.S.-born workers and immigrant laborers began to come apart. And as union leaders in the American Federation of Labor parted ways with socialists and anarchists, each side of the divided workers’ movement claimed one of the two labor days as its own, making the holidays appear increasingly opposed and losing sight of their shared foundation in the campaign for a shorter workday.
Conservative politicians and employers hostile to unions began to equate labor organizing with bomb throwing. In response, trade unions seeking acceptance as part of American industry and democracy displayed their allegiance on Labor Day by waving the American flag, singing patriotic songs and portraying themselves as proud, native-born Americans as opposed to foreign workers with subversive ideas.
Many political radicals and the immigrant workers among whom they found much of their following, meanwhile, came to identify more with the international workers’ movement associated with May Day than with American business and politics. They disavowed May Day’s origins among American trade unions, even as many trade unions distanced themselves from the radical roots of Labor Day. By the turn of the century, May Day moved further from the center of American culture, while Labor Day became more mainstream and less militant.

20th-century gains and losses
In the 20th century, labor unions won shorter hours for many of their members across the country. But they detached that demand from the broader agenda of workers’ autonomy and international solidarity.
They gained a landmark achievement with the federal enactment of the eight-hour day and 40-hour workweek for many industries during the 1930s. At that point, economist John Maynard Keynes projected that the rising productivity of labor would enable 21st-century wage earners to work just three hours a day.
Workers’ productivity did keep climbing as Keynes predicted, and their wages rose apace – until the 1970s. But their work hours did not decline, leaving the three-hour day a forgotten vision of what organized labor might achieve.

(Photo by Brian Logan/U.S. Forest Service)The U.S. Department of Agriculture, parent agency of the U.S. Forest Service, announced Wednesday that it is moving ahead with plans to rescind a rule that has restricted logging and construction on millions of acres of federal lands in the American West for more than two decades.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a written statement that the agency intends to open public comments Friday on its proposal to end the so-called “Roadless Rule,” an act that will affect as much as 45 million acres of federal land as well as millions of Americans who live near it.

Opening a public comment period is the first step in repealing the rule. According to Rollins’ statement, members of the public will have until Sept. 19 to offer their opinions on the repeal, a timeframe that opponents of the plan denounced as inadequate.
Roads are a key prerequisite for large-scale logging and mining projects, and the rule — enacted in 2001 at the end of the Clinton administration — has limited the number of development projects on Forest Service land.
Rollins’ announcement was expected. She had announced the Trump administration’s intent at a conference of western governors in June. The first Trump administration also attempted to eliminate the Roadless Rule, but that move was halted by lawsuits, and the Biden administration dropped the effort.

 Environmental groups say rule’s rollback will harm conservation efforts

In Wednesday’s announcement, Rollins said rescinding the roadless rule would allow local land managers to make decisions on development and logging.
“It is vital that we properly manage our federal lands to create healthy, resilient, and productive forests for generations to come. We look forward to hearing directly from the people and communities we serve as we work together to implement productive and commonsense policy for forest land management,” she said.
Tree thinning could also reduce wildfire risks, she suggested.
Environmental groups, already prepared for Rollins’ announcement, were quick to denounce it as harmful and out of touch.
“America’s national forests give us clean air, water, wildlife, and the freedom for all to enjoy the outdoors,” said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society, in a prepared statement, “but now they are the latest target in this administration’s unpopular push to give away our lands to drill, mine, and log. Gutting the Roadless Rule — which has protected our forests for 25 years — would be the single largest rollback of conservation protections in our nation’s history.”
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, and forests in Colorado and Idaho have already been exempted from it under state-specific guidelines.
 How would Alaska be affected?

Ninety-six percent of the Forest Service’s inventoried roadless areas are located in 12 Western states, and no state is more affected than Alaska, which has almost a third of the 45 million acres affected by the pending change.
Alaska is home to the Tongass National Forest, a West Virginia-sized stretch of islands and waterways in the Southeast Alaska panhandle that make up the largest surviving temperate rainforest in the world.

Until the 1980s, the area was also home to a vast logging program and pulp wood mills that employed thousands of people.
“Across Southeast Alaska, we see the irreparable damage from so many decades of unsustainable clear-cut logging in the scarred landscapes and decimated fish and wildlife habitats — we cannot and will not go back to that, and we know that’s what public comment will show once again,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a statement released Wednesday.
Some Alaska Native tribes in the region support keeping the rule in place, as do some tourism businesses.
“Rescinding the Roadless Rule will devastate our community just as we are beginning to heal from clear-cut logging of the past. It’s clear the people making these decisions in Washington, D.C., don’t care about how it will harm those of us who live here and have lived here for thousands of years,” said President Joel Jackson of the Organized Village of Kake, which has repeatedly intervened in lawsuits seeking to defend the rule.
“We are the people of the forest and salmon people — our lives and our voices should count — this process makes it clear they won’t,” Jackson said.
 Industry leaders, Republicans support repeal of ‘Roadless Rule’

Repealing the Roadless Rule also has powerful support in the region. Local electric utilities have advocated a repeal in order to ease the construction of clean hydroelectric power plants. The Alaska Forest Association, representing the logging industry, supports it, as do mining proponents.
Ten members of the U.S. House’s Committee on Natural Resources were in Anchorage on Wednesday as part of a weeklong tour of the state.
U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, said he believes the Roadless Rule “has really handicapped us in a number of areas,” including in firefighting.
In July, a wildfire swept through parts of Grand Canyon National Park, destroying a historic lodge and dozens of other structures.
Gosar said he believes the federal government needs to take a new approach on federal land in order to thin trees and reduce wildfire risks.
In Utah, which has 4 million acres of inventoried roadless land, Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy said she frequently hears from constituents upset about restrictions on the public use of federal land and supports the repeal.
“One of the complaints my constituents have frequently is that the federal government manages a lot of our resources but isn’t always great at listening to the people who live among the resources. … This Roadless Rule decision is a direct result of complaints from people who live with the Roadless Rule and the unintended consequences it’s having on economies and on resources,” she said.

U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle is a Democrat from Oregon also traveling with the committee. Her state has almost 2 million acres of inventoried roadless area, much of it in her district, but she said she would like to see a more balanced approach than the one being offered by the Trump administration.
“We have to protect our federal lands. We have to make sure that the public has access to our public land, and we have to make sure that we aren’t just wholesale taking out the protections that we worked really, really hard for, because we owe it to the people of this country to protect those lands that truly are theirs,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, is the top Democratic member of the resources committee, and wasn’t on the trip to Alaska.
In an emailed statement, he said Rollins “is steamrolling ahead with Trump’s plan to deliver America’s last wild forests to corporate polluters.”
“Democrats will fight this reckless scheme and stand with Tribes, hunters, anglers, and families who rely on these forests — not corporations looking to cash in,” he said.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)In July North Carolina won bragging rights as the Top State for Business in 2025, according to CNBC. But what’s best for business may not always be best for those carrying out the work.
To coincide with the Labor Day holiday, Oxfam America released the Best States to Work Index (BSWI), and the Tar Heel state is far from the top.
Patricia Stottlemyer, senior domestic policy adviser at Oxfam America, notes that North Carolina came in 52nd in its new analysis that examines labor policies in all 50 states as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico.
A key reason is that North Carolina lawmakers have not raised the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for 16 years.
“That minimum wage has been in place since 2009,” Stottlemyer told NC Newsline. “What that means in North Carolina is that the state minimum wage only covers 18% of what it would [need] to support a family of four. It’s woefully inadequate when it comes to enabling families to support themselves.”
By comparison, Virginia leads the Southeast region in compensation with a minimum wage of $12.41 per hour.
Stottlemyer said it’s a common misconception that when states support workers, that means bad things for the economy.
“That’s just not true. Our index actually looks at several metrics of community well-being, including economic measures and finds that there’s a strong positive correlation between states that have a healthy and robust labor policy landscape.”
In CNBC’s annual business ranking, North Carolina received its lowest marks for quality of life (earning a C-) and cost of living (earning a C+) – an acknowledgement of the rising cost of living in the state.
Beyond compensation, Oxfam underscores that North Carolina lacks critical workplace protections.
North Carolina does not provide a heat safety standard for outdoor workers, nor does it provide specific protection for warehouse workers, according to Oxfam.
The Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability recognizes heat as an escalating crisis with a need for governance to protect workers from heat-related illness.
Workers would also benefit from fixed and fair scheduling. Unpredictable hours can be especially problematic for those whose duties include providing care for children, the elderly, or family members with disabilities.
Leave time is another factor.
“There’s no guarantee that workers have access to paid family and medical leave or paid sick leave,” notes Stottlemyer.
North Carolina is also held back in this year’s index for its “right-to-work” laws. The state ranks at the bottom with South Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas, Texas and Utah for having no support for workers organizing, whether by public or private employees.
In Oxfam’s companion report on the best states for working women, North Carolina is just edged out of the last spot by Mississippi. Again, a lack of paid family leave for working women causes the state’s ranking to bottom out.
“Black mothers in particular are disproportionately likely to be heads of their households and breadwinners. So, if they have access to paid leave, they’re able to stay in the workforce and juggle their caregiving responsibilities as well,” explained Stottlemyer.
State access to paid sick days was a key recommendation in a new report released last week by the N.C. Department of Administration’s Council for Women and Youth Involvement.
This report, “Investing in Economic Opportunity for Women in North Carolina,” found that while the gender wage gap for women has improved over the last seven years, fewer mothers are in the workforce compared to fathers. And North Carolina women working full-time spent 20 to 26% of their annual income on infant childcare.
The cost of childcare posed the greatest burden for Latina and Native American women in North Carolina, based on their earnings.
“Today’s findings reflect the disparities and discrimination women in North Carolina and across the country continue to face, especially women of color,” said Jesseca Boyer, vice president for policy and strategic initiatives at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR).
And there is a ripple effect for the next generation.
North Carolina ranks lowest nationally in preschool enrollment for 3-year-olds, and second lowest among Southeastern state for the enrollment of 4-year-olds in preschool.
Oxfam and the Institute for Women’s Policy Research come to the same conclusion in their respective reports: North Carolina would greatly benefit from raising the minimum wage, indexed  to the cost of living, and by enacting legislation to require employers to provide workers with paid time off for short-term illness or to care for the health of a loved one.

Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State UniversityDecades ago, I was a nonunion journalist whose standard of living depended heavily on the bargaining prowess of the United Auto Workers union.
I worked for a group of Michigan daily newspapers located in a few cities where General Motors was the top employer or among the top three. My wages, cost of living increases and benefits were closely linked to financial packages won by the UAW for its then hundreds of thousands of factory workers at what was called the Big Three automakers.
Michigan economists and policymakers closely watched national UAW contract negotiations, typically held every three or four years, to assess how those contracts would impact the state’s economy. So went the UAW and the automakers, so went Michigan in those days.
A record 26% percent of Michigan workers belonged to a labor union in 1989. Today it’s just over half that at 13.4% The UAW and the rest of organized labor no longer have the power they once did to boost the state’s overall prosperity.
The UAW celebrated its 90th birthday on Aug. 26, appropriately just a few days before Labor Day. It was an event largely devoid of media coverage, an indicator of the shrunken role the union plays in steering the state and national economy.
UAW membership has fallen from a peak of 1.7 million in 1979 to about 375,000 last year, according to its annual report filed with the Labor Department. That largely reflects a similar decline in the number of factory jobs at domestic automakers, which are now known as the Detroit Three, no longer the Big Three.
Only about 150,000 UAW members work at GM, Ford and Stellantis. Most are employed at universities, hospitals, state governments and nonprofits.
A battle-hardened nonagenarian, the UAW faces existential threats from a variety of forces. They include increased factory automation, President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade policies, the auto industry’s choppy transition to electric vehicles, the growth of nonunion automakers in the South and discord at Solidarity House, the UAW’s headquarters in Detroit.
The past couple of years gave hope of a turnaround for the union’s prospects. Fiery UAW President Shawn Fain negotiated record labor contracts with the Detroit Three in 2023. President Joe Biden, promising to be the most pro-labor president in U.S. history, walked a picket line with striking UAW workers at GM, something no other U.S. president had done.

Then came Trump. The new president quickly slapped punishing tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum coming from Canada, Mexico and other countries in attempt to drive more auto production to the U.S.
It was a move that Fain, who harbored a simmering anger about free trade with Canada and Mexico, supported. But the UAW has since become miffed about Trump’s trade agreement with Japan, which lowered auto tariffs from an initial 25% assessed by the president to 15%.
The UAW said it was “deeply angered” by the deal, which it claimed could give imported cars and trucks from nonunion Japanese automakers a cost advantage over U.S.-built vehicles by the Detroit Three.
What’s more, Trump’s tariffs are costing U.S. automakers billions of dollars, likely taking a big chunk out of this year’s profit-sharing checks for UAW workers.

And so far, the tariffs haven’t led to any new auto manufacturing jobs. Instead, there were 10,600 fewer motor vehicle and parts jobs in July than there were last December.
The UAW also is fighting to unionize workers at Detroit Three electric vehicle battery plants, some of which are being built with foreign joint-venture partners.
It appears to have won an organizing drive this month at the BlueOval SK battery plant, a joint-venture between Ford and South Korea-based SK On in Kentucky. But the company is challenging 41 ballots that could change the outcome.
The loss of a union election at the plant—co-owned by Ford, no less—would be a staggering blow to the UAW’s Southern organizing strategy.
Meanwhile, Fain is trying to hang on to his job. A court-appointed monitor in June found the UAW leader engaged in Trump-like retaliatory tactics against the union’s secretary-treasurer. A few union locals are seeking an internal trial for Fain on alleged financial and other misconduct.

But for all the talk of auto jobs moving to Mexico and China, a boom in factory automation could be the biggest threat to the UAW becoming a centenarian.
Hyundai’s new nonunion, highly automated assembly plant in Georgia features robot dogs that work with humans in building vehicles. The robots aren’t paid, don’t get benefits or go on strike.
The South Korean automaker has about two human workers for every robot in the plant. The industry average is seven workers per robot, according to the Wall Street Journal, so there is a lot of room for automakers to robotize their factories.
But existential threats are nothing new for the UAW. For its 90th birthday, the UAW released a highlight video showcasing its hard-won accomplishments that included organizing Detroit automakers, creating the middle class and advancing civil rights.
The fight continues.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Lower Platte South Natural Resources District moved to hire its assistant general manager for the job left vacant by the recent resignation of general manager Mike Sousek.
On Aug. 20, the NRD board voted to negotiate a contract with Assistant General Manager David Potter to become the next GM. The vote came after the board rejected a proposal to appoint a committee to conduct an outside search for candidates.
Potter, who has worked nine years for the NRD, said Friday that a contract was still under negotiation. It could be voted on at the NRD board’s next meeting in September.
In July, Sousek resigned the $178,000-a-year job a month after being placed on suspension with pay.
There has been no public comment on why Sousek was disciplined or why he resigned. But his exit came a couple weeks after the settlement of a lawsuit filed by a female NRD employee who maintained that she had been bypassed for the NRD’s top job because she was a woman. The job went to Sousek.
McKenzie Barry, who had worked for the Lower Platte South NRD for 22 years, filed the gender discrimination lawsuit, claiming, among other things, that two members of the committee interviewing candidates told her that the NRD wasn’t ready to hire a female for the top job.
Sousek, who had served as general manager the past two years, did not immediately return a phone call left Friday seeking comment.
Bob Anderson, the chairman of the Lower Platte South NRD Board, said Friday that there was strong support from the board to pursue a contract with Potter rather than pursue a national search for candidates.
Potter had served as an elected member of the Lower Platte South NRD Board prior to his hiring as assistant general manager. A resident of Valparaiso, he is also a former member of the Butler County Board.
The Lower Platte South NRD covers six counties in southeast Nebraska. It operates nine wildlife management areas and maintains 50 miles of recreational trails, and works with landowners to reduce erosion and manage groundwater use.
Most recently, it has been engaged in talks with Cass County to find an alternate path for a recreation trail linking Lincoln and Omaha. The talks came after the Cass County Board declined in May to affirm a route for the trail that had been approved by the five-member board prior to the November elections. Those elections changed the membership of the board.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0065-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-01 06:56:38.750626

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)Implementation of a new state law requiring Ten Commandments displays in public school classrooms varies across Arkansas as some district superintendents await the results of a lawsuit challenging the legislation.
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks blocked four Northwest Arkansas districts involved in the lawsuit — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale — from enforcing Act 573 on Aug. 4, hours before the law was set to take effect.
Brooks also issued a temporary restraining order against the Conway School District Thursday and ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from Conway schools by 5 p.m. Friday.
Judge orders Central Arkansas district to remove Ten Commandments displays

The Arkansas Advocate last week emailed the state’s public school districts to see whether any had received monetary or poster donations. According to the law, posters must be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions. Displays that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
Of the 45 districts (43 traditional and two charter school districts) not involved in the ongoing litigation that responded to the Advocate’s survey by Friday, 39 said they had not received donations and five said they had — Farmington, Harrison, Lafayette County, Omaha and Rogers. 
The Batesville School District did not specify in its response whether the district had received donations, but communications coordinator Candace Morrow said the district was monitoring the ongoing litigation and guidance from the Arkansas Department of Education.
“Any future decisions will be made carefully, always with the best interests and safety of our students at the center,” Morrow said. 
The Brookland School District had not received donations, according to superintendent George Kennedy, who noted building principals have reported parents asking about the displays. However, no offers to purchase the posters have been made, Kennedy said.
Superintendent Lee Smith said the Mena School District also hadn’t received funds, but was contacted by a local congregation, Cherry Hill Baptist Church, about doing so. The district is awaiting a decision by the court, he said.
“We will comply with the law when/if the court rules in favor of the law requirement and the funds are provided to us,” Smith wrote in an email. 
The Harrison School District received 150 posters, but they have not yet been hung up, according to superintendent Stewart Pratt, who noted the district was in its third week of school. The task is on their to-do list, he said. 
Meanwhile, the Lafayette County School District reported being in the process of hanging up its donated posters, and the Omaha School District was making preparations to do the same. 
“We had our 10 Commandment posters donated this past week, and we are in the process of flattening them out, laminat[ing] them and then get em up!” superintendent John McCleary wrote in an email. 
The Rogers School District reported receiving some donated posters while the Farmington School District reported receiving 210. Both Northwest Arkansas districts said they were awaiting further legal clarification about next steps. 
“We have not hung any posters,” Farmington superintendent Jon Laffoon said in an email. “We are awaiting further clarity following the recent preliminary injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on August 4, as well as the Attorney General’s appeal.”
Legal proceedings
Seven families with religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed a federal lawsuit in June that argues the law is unconstitutional because it violates their religious freedom rights. Supporters of the legislation and lawyers for the state have argued the tenets are a historical document that influenced the country’s founders in the creation of the nation’s laws and legal system.
Brooks disagreed and issued a preliminary injunction in early August that blocked the law from being applied at the four Northwest Arkansas school districts named as defendants in the case. 
On Aug. 22, Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a notice of appeal and plaintiffs’ attorneys asked the court’s permission to add the Conway School District as a defendant and two families from the district as plaintiffs in the ongoing lawsuit. The Conway School District hung Ten Commandments displays in its schools, according to court filings.
Christian groups, Arkansas lawmakers defend Ten Commandments law

Brooks granted permission to add the new parties to the case Wednesday. Attorneys filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on behalf of two Conway district families, which Brooks granted Thursday.
Following Brooks’ preliminary injunction on Aug. 4, the ACLU of Arkansas warned districts not to implement the law. Backers of the legislation responded by encouraging people to donate to the campaign to place Ten Commandments displays in schools. Some followed the latter’s advice in Pine Bluff where ministers donated posters to the local school district, according to The Pine Bluff Commercial.
The Fayetteville School District reported receiving hundreds of donated posters prior to Brooks’ injunction, according to court filings. A Springdale School District spokesperson told the Advocate last week that his district had not received any donations. A Siloam Springs District spokesperson said they don’t comment on pending litigation. Bentonville, the other district named in the original lawsuit, did not respond to the Advocate’s questions about donations by publication. 
Laws similar to Arkansas’ are being challenged in neighboring states. A federal appeals court blocked a Louisiana law in June. Meanwhile, a federal judge temporarily blocked a Texas law from taking full effect in nearly a dozen districts in August.

More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.

Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.










Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids.


– Craig Greenberg, mayor of Louisville 


Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct. 22.

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public opinion in Idaho strongly opposes the sale of public lands, with a recent poll showing 96% of registered voters believe public lands should remain public, a sentiment shared across both Democratic and Republican parties. This opposition stems from concerns about losing access, damaging the natural infrastructure that supports the economy, and harming wildlife, with the public actively holding elected officials accountable on the issue.
New poll finds 96% Idaho voters say public lands should remain in public hands

U.S. Sen. Jim Risch , R-Idaho, has stated, after reviewing the Senate Energy and Natural Resources reconciliation language: I do not support the proposed provision to sell public lands.
U.S. Sens. Risch and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, have made statements opposing the sale of more than three million acres of public land as part of the federal budget reconciliation bill. The land-sale provision was stripped from the House version of the spending bill thanks to opposition from legislators including U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho.
Simpson supports efforts to preserve Idaho’s public lands from being sold or transferred and to maintain multiple-use access for recreation, grazing, and ranching, opposing federal rules he believes undermine the “multiple use” mandate and advocating for bills that keep these lands in public hands. He cosponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act to ban the sale or transfer of most public lands and is a vice-chairman of the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus.
Idaho state legislators from both parties celebrated the death of a federal proposal that would have made millions of acres of public lands, including in Idaho, available to be sold off. On June 30, 43 Republican Idaho state legislators signed a letter thanking Simpson, Crapo and Risch for protecting access to public lands during the recent federal budget reconciliation process.
In July 2025, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, voted against the Public Lands in Public Hands Act and a related amendment to block the sale of federal lands in Nevada and Utah. This was the only “no” vote from Idaho’s congressional delegation.
He was not included in a thank you letter from Idaho Republican lawmakers for protecting public lands.
“Public lands and access to those lands are a cornerstone of Idaho’s identity,” the letter states. “Thanks to your efforts, these amazing spaces will remain in public hands. By ensuring access to hunting, fishing, grazing, and outdoor recreation, Idaho will continue to look like the Idaho we all know and love.”
We, the Idaho public need to initiate a process to elect a new 1st District representative who will wholeheartedly keep Idaho public lands and access as a cornerstone of Idaho’s identity.  Furthermore, elect a 1st District representative who opposes the sale of Idaho lands and keep Idaho’s amazing spaces in public hands.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.
Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

With vintage war planes hanging overhead from the ceiling, Sanford L. Jones Sr. of Richmond peered out at an audience of about 300, mostly tourists. With him were Emily Drake of Pennsylvania and Lewis Harned of Wisconsin, ready for a discussion to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
The deadliest conflict in history — causing the deaths of 70 million to 85 million people, more than half of them civilians — officially came to an end on Sept. 2, 1945. Terms of surrender were signed by Japanese officials aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay and accepted by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
On the museum stage in New Orleans, veteran Drake, a stenographer with the Women’s Army Corps during the war, was the first to take her seat. She was joined by Jones and Harned, a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in the war and a longtime U.S. Armed Forces doctor.

Before host Peter Crean started the panel discussion, Drake softly made a comment to Jones that her microphone picked up and broadcast to the crowd.
“I’m nervous,” she said. Jones immediately replied, “Well, I am, too.”
Smatterings of laughter could be heard in the audience, then applause. It was a gesture praising three veterans who bravely offered so much during the war and now were a bit nervous before a friendly crowd. Their humility was on display.
“Well, Emily,” added Jones. “We are here because not many of us are left.”
According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as of January 2025, fewer than 66,000 U.S. World War II veterans remain alive out of the 16.4 million Americans who served during the war. This number represents less than 1% of the total who served. By 2034, only about 1,000 are projected to still be with us.
Museum official Crean said at the commemoration ceremony that the life of each of the three people on stage was emblematic of the strength and bravery of the men and women who served in World War II.
Here is the story of one of them, Kentuckian Sanford Logan Jones Sr.
From Lost Creek to San Giovanni and back to Lost Creek

Jones was a U.S. Army Air Forces gunner on B-24 Liberators in the European theater. He received a recommendation of valor for his 35 combat missions “in air battles of great intensity.”
On Sept. 22, Jones will turn 100. He was born near Lost Creek in Eastern Kentucky’s Perry County. “It was a very isolated and rural place with no running water, no electricity, no phone,” he said. 
Lost Creek, 10 miles long and mainly in Breathitt County, is a tributary of Troublesome Creek which flows into the North Fork of the Kentucky River. Many homes in the watershed were destroyed in a flash flood in July 2022.
Sanford’s father, Dave Jones, was a coal miner. His mother, Grace Elizabeth Terry, was an elementary school teacher. The couple had two girls and four boys.
Sanford attended a one-room school in Lost Creek. One teacher served eight grades.  “I still can see that pot-bellied stove in that school,” he said.
He graduated from elementary school in 1940 and then attended a school in Breathitt County through his junior year.
Jones remembered walking to church as a 16-year-old with a friend on Sunday Dec. 7, 1941.

“We were walking back home from church later that afternoon and saw a crowd at a house,” he said.  “We stopped by to see what was going on and we found people listening to a Philco radio, something about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The next day President Roosevelt talked about the day of infamy.
“The people had serious faces. I thought this will probably mean I’m going to war.”
In November 1943, before he finished high school, Jones got a draft notice from the Army in Hazard. That led him to training in a series of Army bases.  
“I especially remember the marching songs I learned,” he said. “Left, right, left, right. One, two, three, four. You had a good home and you left it.”
In Biloxi, Mississippi, young Jones was assigned to a gunnery school. He was soon ready for combat. On Oct. 16, 1944, he landed at San Giovanni Airfield in Italy to join the U.S. Army 15th Air Forces, 304th Bombardment Wing, 455th Bombardment Group.
A month later, he flew his first combat mission. It was to Munich, Germany. “My responsibility on that mission was to release bundles of aluminum foil from the plane to deflect radar to keep anyone from spotting us. In other missions, I was a turret gunner.”

 A turret is a revolving armored structure in aircraft that houses one or more guns and can be rotated to aim the weapons in different directions. The operator is often in a cramped, dangerous position. Jones stood 5 feet, 8 inches and weighed 137 pounds.
Jones’ combat missions were over Germany, Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia.  Memories of enemy flak aimed at his plane will not be forgotten.
Was he ever scared?
“Fear is one of the most powerful emotional responses,” he said. “I just did my job but the fear was there. I always felt I was going to come back home.”
The first 100 runs of the 455th Bombardment Group were the most dangerous, Jones said. “About 75% of them were never completed.”
 A commendation for Jones’ bravery in the skies over Europe.
On May 8, 1945, after 35 combat missions, Jones was sent to Naples, Italy. On May 25, he landed in Florida and was assigned to a parts division. 
On Oct. 20, 1945, Jones got his discharge papers as a staff sergeant. He rode a bus from Florida to Lexington. He then caught a bus service that put him about five miles from his Lost Creek home.  
Jones arrived on foot and unannounced. “I can’t tell you the minute-by-minute reunion with my family but I know there were a lot of smiles.”
Sanford Jones was back home. The world was trying to heal after a horrific war, and he found Lost Creek was still an isolated place.
Beyond Lost Creek

“It was a little bit awkward at first being home. It was different from the military world I left. I wanted to do something with myself and I knew that education was the way,” said Jones.
He secured his high school diploma from Robinson High School in Perry County.  He then successfully applied to the Eastern Kentucky State College (now Eastern Kentucky University) under the federal GI bill and earned a science degree.
At the University of Kentucky, he not only got a master’s degree in science but met the love of his life.
“At UK’s Student Center one day in the summer of 1954, I saw a group square dancing. I don’t think they do much of that today at UK. I saw a certain girl. I liked what I saw. I introduced myself and she started looking at me. I asked her to dance. We did. I then thought I would never see her again. So I asked her out for a date the next night. She was working on her master’s in elementary education. She accepted.”
On Aug. 18, 1956, Sanford Jones and June Elizabeth Daugherty of Louisville were married at Crescent Hill Methodist Church in Louisville. She had been teaching the last six years at Brandeis Elementary School in Louisville.

After he finished his doctorate at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, the couple moved to Richmond in 1961 where he became a professor at Eastern Kentucky University. For 13 years, he served as chair of the school’s Department of Biological Sciences. He retired June 30, 1992. 
They have three children: Sanford Logan Jones Jr., a psychiatrist in Cincinnati; Henry Mason Jones, a teleradiologist in Rancho Mirage, Calif., and Catherine Elizabeth Jones, an architect in Manhattan in New York City.
Sanford’s wife died March 23, 2019. She was almost 91. Besides raising a family, she taught a Sunday school class at a local Methodist church and was active in the League of Women Voters.
“She had a bad fall and fracture. We had about 63 years together. I appreciate all of them,” said Jones. 
During their marriage, they visited the island of Capri in Italy, known for its picturesque scenery. That’s where young Jones was stationed for “rest and relaxation” breaks from his combat missions in World War II a world ago.
He says today his life has been “one of wonderful connections.”
In recent years, his namesake son has taken him to World War II museums and reunions. Earlier this year, he was invited to be a panelist at the grand National WWII museum in New Orleans with two other veterans to share stories that highlighted the bravery and humility of veterans in the global conflict that ended 80 years ago.
“I couldn’t turn that down, though I was a little nervous,” he said.

Most Mexicans who call Imperial home hail from the northern state of Chihuahua, where the band is also from. (Bob Alberts/Flatwater Free Press)IMPERIAL, Nebraska — In a dusty show barn, kids march out their prize-winning swine as an auctioneer sings out competing bids.
Outside, shrieks pierce this hot August night as families spin in loops on lit-up carnival rides. Vendors sell giant chocolate ice creams and funnel cakes, corn dogs and lemonades.
Every year, the Chase County Fair & Expo draws 10,000 people to this county of 3,764. They come for the classic small-town rite of summer. And they come for the fair’s annual concerts.
This year, the county fair did something new. For the first time, fair organizers hired a Mexican band to perform, figuring that made practical sense in a community whose Latino population has grown sixfold since 2000. The announcement brought buzz and excitement on social media.
But in the hours leading up to the Thursday night concert, only 300 tickets had sold, low for the grandstand that can hold 3,500. Many local Latino residents had decided to stay home, afraid of what could happen.

“The rumor was that this was bait,” Imperial resident Cynthia Almanza said while waiting for the concert to start. “That ICE was going to show up.”
The local rumor mill also alleged that the county sheriff had been the one to make that call.
Versions of this story burned through Imperial and surrounding towns this summer, Almanza and other residents told the Flatwater Free Press.
The Chase County sheriff was upset the fair had booked a Mexican band, residents said. He had called the feds, they said. They even said the fair had planned the concert as a trap. The suspicion grew so strong that one Imperial police officer went so far as to ask Immigration and Customs Enforcement: Did the sheriff contact you?
Chase County Sheriff Kevin Mueller said in an emailed statement it was a “false and harmful rumor” that he “made a racist comment” during a fair board meeting discussing security needs for the concert.
But it was true that he called ICE, he said in an email Thursday evening.
“I did place a call to ICE,” Mueller wrote. “About a week later, someone returned my call … by that time, I had already determined that we had sufficient security in place through the Fair Board and the State Patrol.”
The idea that ICE agents could show up at the fair took root in people’s minds. Almanza had friends who skipped the show. “It terrified lots of people,” she said.
“It made me question if I should even be here,” said Judith Beltran, another concertgoer, who heard the story of the potential ICE raid shortly after arriving for the concert from Denver. “Just because of the chaos … I don’t want to be in the middle of it.”
In the eight months of immigration crackdowns under the Trump administration, fear of ICE raids has penetrated many aspects of immigrant life in Nebraska. Rumors of raids and government vehicle sightings flood Facebook groups and WhatsApp chats.
Some families are retreating from public life, including some who have legal status, advocates say. It’s keeping kids from attending school, they say, and parents from going to work.
In Imperial, it left some wondering: Is the county fair safe?
A Latino band
The Chase County Fair Board approached Rodolfo Aragon in April with a question: Would he join the committee to help book a Latino band? The board was trying to make the annual event more inclusive, Aragon said, and wanted “to thank people for being a part of the community.”
Aragon moved to the area 21 years ago to work for the feedlot Imperial Beef. He encouraged his brother to join him. They’re one of the many families from Chihuahua, Mexico, that found a home here, drawn by feedlot jobs or farm work at the potato grower Frenchman Valley Produce.

In 2000, only 5% of Imperial’s residents were Latino, according to census data. Now, nearly a third of the city’s residents are.
“The whole community has really shifted in the last two to three decades,” said Tyler Pribbeno, an Imperial native and the city administrator. “Imperial has sustained its population … we would have been much smaller, probably the size of Grant, if we didn’t have all these people coming in and choosing to live and work and play here.”
The fair board first suggested a smaller act to draw this ever-growing Latino crowd, maybe a show that didn’t play at the main grandstand, maybe a local band.
But the newly recruited Aragon and the concert committee wanted to go bigger. After all, Johnny Cash played the Chase County Fair. So did Alice Cooper.
“We didn’t want the Hispanic pick to be any different,” Aragon said. “Let’s pick someone from Chihuahua, everyone’s going to be drawn to that.”
In May, they hit what they thought was the Mexican music jackpot, hiring La Fiera de Ojinaga, an accordion-driven norteño band from northern Mexico with more than 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify and hundreds of millions of streams.
Then, Aragon started hearing a rumor. White residents were telling their Latino friends: You might not want to be at that concert. People in the country legally worried about attending, scared that they could get detained because of the color of their skin, Aragon said.

The most out-there version of the rumor he heard: That the fair board had planned the concert as a trap.
“We can’t control fear. We can only control what we can control,” said Ryan Stromberger, president of the fair board. “It’s unfortunate that they felt that way, I don’t know how we can control that, though … Obviously we had no ill intentions, otherwise we wouldn’t have booked it.”
Rumors roll
Much of this fear appeared to stem from the May fair board meeting, when the board convened weeks before fair leaders planned to announce the last-minute concert addition.
City police and the Sheriff’s Office attended to discuss concert security. They appeared to single out the Mexican concert as a specific worry.
The law enforcement officers “voiced concerns about disturbances during Thursday’s night concert,” meeting minutes read. “They want to know about security precautions for concert nights.”
The discussion lasted about 20 minutes, according to meeting minutes. There is no audio recording of that meeting. Fair board members deferred questions to Stromberger, who said discussion focused mostly on whether law enforcement agencies had the budget and manpower to accommodate an extra concert night.
But that discussion continued among law enforcement officers outside the meeting room, said Chris Bustillos, the Imperial police sergeant. After that meeting, the rumors started to spiral, several Imperial residents said in interviews.
Mueller, the county sheriff, said in an email that any rumors that he “made a racist comment during a fair board meeting” were false.
“We had concerns that an extra night would place additional strain on our resources,” he wrote. “Apparently, one member took offense to my comments and began spreading a false and harmful rumor about me … this allegation is baseless, damaging, and driven by personal agendas — not facts.”
Bustillos said he decided to fact-check the rumors himself.
“I believe our sheriff for Chase County contacted someone either in your office or on the hotline about a Hispanic concert we will be having for our Chase County Expo Fair,” he wrote to the North Platte ICE office in an email obtained by the Flatwater Free Press through a records request. “I was just hoping to find out if that is something you or anyone in the ICE office will be attending? Again, I was just informed our sheriff contacted you. I have no idea if he really did or if that’s something you do.”
Replying via email, a Department of Homeland Security agent replied that the office had “received a call regarding the concerts.”
Bustillos said he and the DHS agent then spoke by phone. The agent told him that yes, the Sheriff’s Office had contacted the ICE office, Bustillos said in an interview. No, the ICE agents weren’t planning to come to the fair.
Mueller didn’t return a phone call Thursday seeking additional comment. Instead, he had a Sheriff’s Office employee send the Flatwater Free Press his emailed statement. He had previously not returned two other phone calls and an email seeking comment, instead communicating via another emailed statement.
Calling ICE had “nothing to do with the false allegation that I made racist comments,” Mueller wrote. “My focus throughout has been solely on ensuring the safety and security of the fair, nothing more.”
An ICE spokesperson declined to discuss any interaction with the sheriff.
“Pushing something out about ICE speaking to a sheriff or other law enforcement officers, with whom we partner with on a daily basis, will do nothing but fear monger,” spokesperson Tanya Roman wrote in an email. “There is no reason why anyone not breaking the law should have any concerns about one law enforcement agency speaking to another.”
Knowing your rights
On a Sunday afternoon two weeks before the fair, about 20 people gathered in an Imperial United Methodist Church sanctuary. The day’s lecture: Knowing your rights if stopped by ICE.
After hearing the fair rumors, Jo Leyland felt moved to act. The retired city administrator started calling nonprofits, hoping to get a pamphlet she could hand out to people about immigration rights. Instead, staff members from Nebraska Appleseed, a nonprofit that advocates for immigrant rights, offered to make the nearly four-hour drive from Lincoln to Imperial.
“I wanted to educate people, both with brown and white faces, about what could be done if the worst thing happened and ICE did show up,” Leyland said.
After the presentation at the church, Leyland took Know Your Rights cards from an Appleseed rep to pass out at the fair. The city took pamphlets to keep at the library and city offices. By the end of the session, all the paper handouts had been taken.
Appleseed has held worker’s rights safety trainings for years, said Ruby Méndez López, a community organizer with the nonprofit. But since January, the nonprofit has held about 20 Know Your Rights meetings across the state, educating immigrants and Americans on what they can and can’t do during a crackdown.
People are desperate for this information, Méndez López said, and grateful to get it. But getting people to attend Know Your Rights sessions can be a challenge.
“If we publicly post Know Your Rights information, people get really nervous about showing up,” Méndez López said. “People start to think it’s a trap put on by whoever is planning it.”
At the Imperial meeting, most of the attendees were white. Méndez López tried to set up a smaller Know Your Rights session with migrant workers in town. People were too scared to come, she said. The fear of going out in public has come and gone in waves through 2025, Méndez López said.
It was strong at the start of the year, when President Donald Trump took office. It peaked again after the immigration raid at Glenn Valley in Omaha, when ICE detained about 75 people. In the aftermath, rumors of potential ICE raids in towns like Lexington and Grand Island flooded social media. No other large raid has yet happened.
“People were just not showing up to work,” Méndez López said. “When there’s rumors that are unverified, it disrupts people’s lives entirely … it’s hard to know what to believe.”
How it went
On Thursday night at the fair, excitement over the concert mixed with unease and uncertainty. At a large booth on the midway, young members of the Lions Club shouted out bingo numbers — in English and Spanish.

Further down the midway, a cutout of Donald and Melania Trump advertised a booth selling MAGA hats and T-shirts, thermoses proclaiming “Don’t Tread on Me” and “I voted for the felon.”
No immigration authorities showed up that night. And fewer concertgoers than usual showed up, too — roughly 500 people ended up buying tickets to see La Fiera de Ojinaga, Stromberger said, far fewer than the combined 6,000 attendees at the Friday and Saturday country acts.
But the hundreds of mostly Latino fans who did attend came dressed in their best cowboy hats, jeans and boots. Some, like Almanza, never thought they would see a day when one of their favorite Mexican bands played their small-town American fair.
As the band played, couples paired off and whirled their way around the empty back half of the venue, stepping in time with the band’s bouncy drumbeat in the glowing light of the stage. The notes of an accordion and saxophone rang out into the crowd.
And when the band shouted out their home state of Chihuahua, whoops and cheers erupted from the crowd.
Behind the crowd, a lit-up Ferris wheel looped kids into the sky. Vendors handed out cotton candy and fried Oreos. For a moment, it felt like another night at the fair.

Founded in 1869 in Philadelphia, the Knights “tried to teach the American wage-earner that he was a wage-earner first and a bricklayer, carpenter, miner, shoemaker, after; that he was a wage-earner first and a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, white, black, Democrat, Republican, after,” historian Norman J. Ware wrote in “The Labor Movement in the United States 1860-1895: A Study in Democracy.” I’d add “teacher” to the list of jobs.
“The Knights operated as both a trade union federation and a political movement,” wrote historian Jonathan Garlock. “Envisioning a ‘Cooperative Commonwealth’ in which producer cooperatives and nationalized railroads would replace monopolistic capitalism, the Knights launched dozens of local and state labor parties and hundreds of worker-owned cooperatives.”
Knights belonged to Local Assemblies which numbered in the thousands. Each assembly “represented members in their work places, bargaining with employers, threatening and conducting strikes,” Garlock added. “Inclusivity was the other hallmark of the KOL (especially in comparison to the American Federation of Labor unions that followed). The Knights included African American workers and counted 246 local assemblies organized by women workers.”
The main goal of the Knights and other 19th century unions was the eight-hour workday. They also called for the abolition of child labor. But the Knights argued that men and women who did the same job should get the same pay.
The Knights’ motto was, “That is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all.” The union peaked at almost a million members in the late 1880s, before fading away and all but disappearing by the turn of the 20th century.
The union spread nationwide, and even worldwide, with Local Assemblies in Canada, Great Britain and Australia. According to The Kentucky Encyclopedia, 177 assemblies operated in Kentucky — in Louisville, Covington Lexington, Frankfort and even in small towns like Fulton. I treasure a copy of The Toiler, the Fulton Knights’ newspaper.
On Nov. 25, 1894, Lexington area Knights celebrated their union’s 25th birthday at the Opera House, enjoying “a gratifying success in every feature,” according to the Kentucky Leader of Nov. 26. (A ball followed at Jackson Hall with Saxton’s Band providing the dance music.)
Success was often elusive for unions as the country rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. Well-heeled capitalists helped whip up anti-labor hysteria by demonizing unions as “un-Christian” and “un-American,” even communist.
Most employers, notably in industry, stubbornly, even violently, resisted unions, with help from friendly local and state officials. Judges routinely issued injunctions to stop strikes. Police, sheriff’s deputies and even National Guard troops were almost always available for strikebreaking duty.
Union-busting was bipartisan. Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes dispatched federal troops to break the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, sent U.S. soldiers to crush the Pullman Strike in 1894.
To protect its members against getting fired by anti-union bosses, the Knights had started as a secret organization. The Knights dropped its veil of secrecy in 1879 and deleted “Noble and Holy Order” from its original name.
Afterwards, the union enjoyed rapid growth.
Featured speakers at the 25th birthday celebration included local Democratic Congressman W.C.P. Breckinridge, a Confederate veteran, and Dr. W.T. Bolling, a Lexington pastor.
Breckinridge acknowledged that the federal government had the power to abolish child labor, outlaw the company store system and pass laws to make workplaces sanitary. But he rebuked those who looked to federal “legislation as the great panacea or cure all of the nineteenth century,” the Lexington paper said.
Bolling advised workers that if they would “be true, be patient, honest and diligent” and vote “the time will come when the host of labor may sing as sung Israel when freed from the bondage of Egypt.”
The Leader didn’t report the Knights’ reaction to the politician or the pastor. But based on the preamble to the union’s 1878 “Declaration of Principles” they might have been disappointed. The preamble warned that “the alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will invariably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.”
Thus, it was “imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth. This much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction, ‘In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.’”
A footnote: Not everybody was welcome to join the Knights, explained a Nov. 25 Leader story about the upcoming anniversary observance. The banned list included “stock-holders, bankers, lawyers, professional gamblers, and those who, in any way, derive their living from the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors.”

(Photo courtesy of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, Miami Field Office)More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.
The New Hampshire legislature passed two anti-sanctuary bills earlier this year that, with Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s signature, became law and go into effect in January. Republican lawmakers have tried repeatedly since 2006 to pass legislature that would prohibit “sanctuary city” policies. This year they were finally able to get enough Democratic votes in the House, with Democratic lawmakers saying the amended version lessened its impact and was preferable to a stricter alternative.
Gov. Ayotte signs two anti-sanctuary city bills into law

Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

(Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Youngkin touts Va.’s $4.7 billion cash cushion, downplays Medicaid, federal workforce changes

Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
Federal cuts hit coastal flooding, dam projects

“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.
In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

During the 2024 election campaign, the Republican Party’s historically fraught relationship with organized labor appeared to be changing. Several influential Republicans reached out to unions, seeking to cement the loyalties of the growing ranks of working-class Americans who have been backing Donald Trump’s presidential runs and voting for other members of his party.
During Trump’s first bid for the White house, the percentage of votes in households where at least one person belongs to a union fell to its lowest level in decades. In 2021, Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator at the time, wrote a USA Today op-ed supporting a unionization drive at an Amazon facility. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, walked a United Auto Workers picket line in 2023 in solidarity with striking workers.
As the 2024 GOP presidential nominee, Trump spotlighted International Brotherhood of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien with a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention – rewarding the union for staying neutral in that campaign after endorsing Joe Biden four years earlier.
Yet O’Brien shocked many in the convention crowd by lambasting longtime GOP coalition partners such as the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable for hurting American workers.
Once in office, Trump continued to signal some degree of solidarity with the blue-collar voters who backed him. He chose former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Teamsters ally, to be his second-term labor secretary.
I’m a sociologist who has been researching the U.S. labor movement for over two decades. Given conservatives’ long-standing antipathy toward unions, I was curious whether the GOP’s greater engagement with labor portended any kind of change in its policies.
Fumbled at the starting line
The GOP’s various outreach efforts during the 2024 campaign led University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, a scholar of declining labor power, to write, “Is a pro-labor Republican Party possible?”
More than six months into Trump’s second term, I would say that based on the evidence thus far the answer to Posner’s question is a resounding no.
In late March 2025, Trump issued an executive order stripping hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their collective bargaining rights.
Overnight, twice as many federal employees lost their union protections as there are members of the United Auto Workers union, making the action “the largest and most aggressive single act of union-busting in U.S. history,” according to Georgetown University labor historian Joseph McCartin.
While affected unions have challenged that action and similar subsequent ones in court, the Trump administration is moving onto other agencies. In August, over 400,000 federal employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs and Environmental Protection Agency saw their union contracts terminated and their collective bargaining rights dissolved.
Everett Kelley, the American Federation of Government Employees president, described the attacks on federal workers as a “setback for fundamental rights in America.”
Tariffs, other policies aren’t helping
The Trump administration has pitched its erratic tariff policies as a boon to U.S.manufacturing, including in the automotive industry, once the foundation of the U.S. labor movement.

In reality, U.S. car producers are struggling to keep up with rising tariff-related costs of raw materials and parts. The number of factory jobs has fallen to the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, a supporter of targeted tariffs to buttress the domestic auto industry, criticized the administration’s trade policy in April 2025, saying, “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”
Other administration actions cast as relief for struggling workers are unlikely to deliver as advertised. The “no tax on tips” provision in Trump’s huge tax-and-spending package excludes the nearly 40% of tipped workers whose earnings fall below the federal income tax threshold. Tipped workers make up a tiny share of the low-wage workforce.
Culinary Workers Local 226, a powerful Nevada union representing many tipped workers in Las Vegas and Reno, supported the provision. Yet it blasted the overall package, calling it a “big, horrible bill” for its windfalls to the rich instead of the working class.
Removing the watchdogs
The National Labor Relations Board is responsible for ensuring management and labor adhere to provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. Passed in 1935, that law established workers’ fundamental rights to collective bargaining. The board is responsible for conducting union elections, investigating allegations of unfair labor practices and outright abuses by employers, and enforcing court orders when employers or unions are found to have broken labor laws.
Presidents regularly use vacancies to tilt the ideological balance of the board to a more or less labor-friendly position. Trump, however, went further.
Soon after he was sworn in for a second term, Trump fired the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel along with board member Gwynne Wilcox, who was only halfway through her five-year term. Wilcox’s dismissal was unprecedented and violated the National Labor Relations Act provision on board personnel changes.
Wilcox’s removal left the body without a quorum, preventing it from responding to appeals or requests for review and allowing employers accused of violating workers’ rights to delay any settlement. The Trump administration has left those important NLRB jobs vacant for months, although it has nominated two management-friendly replacements, both of whom awaited Senate approval in mid-August.
In the meantime, the agency is unable to hear labor disputes.
Disempowering the NLRB is a long-standing Republican tactic, suggesting more continuity with past GOP attacks on labor than a new era of partnership.
Hawley standing out
To be sure, Republicans don’t all agree with one another on the importance of supporting workers and labor rights. One who has stood out so far is Hawley. The relatively pro-labor Republican senator’s stance led him to partner with Sen. Corey Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to co-sponsor the Faster Labor Contracts Act.
This new bill would force employers to negotiate a contract in a reasonable time frame with employees once they have voted in favor of forming a union.
Hawley also joined with Democrats to reintroduce a bill that would ban dangerous work speed requirements in warehouses. Hawley said, when summarizing his efforts on behalf of working people, “It’s time we deliver for them.”
The Missouri senator is not completely alone. Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Roger Marshall of Kansas, both Republicans, have backed some labor-friendly legislation in the spring and summer of this year.
GOP leaders in Congress are not moving those bills forward so far, likely in part due to pushback from Republicans and their allies outside Congress.
And there are limits to Hawley’s labor friendliness. He voted for Trump’s tax-and-spending package, despite publicly airing his misgivings about the harm it may cause his blue-collar constituents.
Meanwhile, his past partners in the more labor-friendly wing of the GOP now occupy prominent administration posts. Yet they have largely fallen silent on union issues — except, in Rubio’s case, to oversee the firing of well over 1,000 State Department employees, many of them members of the American Foreign Service Association union.
Trump labor approach echoes Reagan’s style
Another GOP presidential administration courted segments of the labor movement to divide a key Democratic constituency, only to take actions that weakened unions.
In 1980, for example, Ronald Reagan sought and won the endorsement of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. A year later, he fired 13,000 striking members of that union.
The Teamsters union also backed Reagan – twice. It endorsed him in 1980 after he pledged during the 1980 campaign not to pursue anti-labor policies. Although he broke his promise, personal outreach from Vice President George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the 1984 election earned him the Teamsters endorsement a second time.
What seems clear in my view is that whenever the GOP has tried to cast itself as a labor-friendly political party, it has emphasized symbolism over substance, favoring using rhetoric embracing workers who belong to unions versus taking actions to strengthen labor rights.

And then, in late August, a new pledge by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to remove most — but not all — of those counter-tariffs by Sept. 1.
The trade policies between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have careened in recent months, sending businesses into uncertainty as President Donald Trump pushes through aggressive and evolving negotiating tactics.
In New Hampshire, they appear to be having an impact. By June 2025, exports to Canada for the year were 42.6% lower than at the same point in 2024, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Foreign Trade Bureau.
But this fall, lawmakers and state officials are hoping to push past the chaos and make a simple pitch: The Granite State is still open for business.
Over multiple days in early September, New Hampshire leaders will carry out a trade mission with Canadian and American businesses to try to strengthen cross border ties. The efforts will culminate in Quebec City, when Gov. Kelly Ayotte will participate in what has been billed as an “intimate reception” for politicians and business leaders at a Hilton hotel.
Plans for the trade mission, which are still under development, include a Sept. 8 bus tour to Nova Scotia — by way of Littleton — with business leaders from both countries, according to Sen. Tim McGough, a Merrimack Republican and the chairman of the New Hampshire Canadian Trade Council. That will be followed by a journey to Quebec ahead of the event with the governor,
“We’re pretty happy to have a good contingent of significant business leaders joining us on the bus,” said McGough during a council meeting Monday.
“They’re a captive audience,” he added, speaking of the Canadian business representatives. “And they’re looking forward to the captive audience too.”

The effort comes as New Hampshire’s economy has shown signs it has been affected by the trade war between Washington and Ottawa.
Canada is still New Hampshire’s No. 2 export country, bolstered in large part by sales of aircraft and spacecraft parts from companies such as Marmon Aerospace & Defense and GE Aviation. The state also sends machinery and fabricated metal products, according to a 2019 fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Commerce. But while in the full 2024 calendar year, the Granite State sent $1.2 billion worth of products over the northern border, it had only sent about $400 million by June of this year.
In contrast, exports to New Hampshire’s leading export country, Germany, were 3.2% higher in June 2025 than in June 2024. And exports to Mexico, the state’s third highest importer, were up 14.9% in June.
Overall, New Hampshire’s exports to all countries, which totaled $7.1 billion in all of 2024, were down 4.19% in June.
 Uncertain times

The state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs is watching those numbers.
The department cannot be certain the drop in exports to Canada was caused by the tariffs; it could be supply chain changes that are unrelated, said Adam Boltik, program manager of the department’s Office of International Commerce.
“But with something like a 40% drop, that does make you look,” he said in an interview.
To help businesses keep up with the changing conditions, the BEA has regularly posted the latest tariffs on a page on its website. But Boltik said companies must make their own decisions over what to do with that information.
“We are here to be a resource,” he said. That can mean helping businesses affected by the tariffs to find “mitigating measures” such as alternative sources for their materials. The department can also help companies look for new markets to sell their products if the Canadian tariffs are hurting their business, he said.
The department is limited in what it knows. While some top line economic figures exist, much of the BEA’s understanding comes from anecdotes. “When companies will come to me and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got this coming in from Country X and all of a sudden, there’s a tariff on it. What happens?’” In many cases, there is no way to collect the aggregate data needed to better understand those anecdotes, he added.
Carney’s announcement that Canada would be lifting many of its retaliatory tariffs is good news for many New Hampshire businesses, Boltik said. Still, there is a new worry. On Friday, Trump’s executive order ending the “de minimus” tariff exception for U.S. imports will take effect. That change will mean that goods coming into the U.S. worth $800 or less, which were previously exempt from tariffs, will suddenly be subject to the taxes.
That, Boltik fears, could lead Canada to retaliate by imposing tariffs on small-dollar imports from the U.S. as well.
“There may be enough of an outcry from those Canadian producers and small businesses that Canada does something,” he said.
 An enduring relationship

René Sylvestre, Québec’s delegate to New England, is optimistic the longstanding ties between the two geographic reasons can survive the tumult.
“Our economies are so intertwined that we’re still looking to do business and work with companies and folk in New England,” he said in an interview.
Despite the tariffs, Sylvestre said he hasn’t seen major changes in operations by Québécois companies, partly because the supply chains are so established. That includes aerospace companies.
One source of that optimism: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, passed during the first Trump term as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement protects a swath of products from tariffs, including agriculture, automobile products, textiles, machinery, and digital products.
“Pretty much most of our products are under the USMCA,” Sylvestre said.
That agreement did not stop the Trump administration from adding 25% tariffs to automobiles, steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, which the White House has said is allowed by security exceptions.
Sylvestre said trade missions such as the one in September are intended to reassure businesses.And the idea has precedent: In April, soon after the tariff standoff kicked off, a delegation of Canadian businesses visited Portsmouth for a similar trade mission.
 Tourism decline

If businesses are staying the course, tourism is a different story. The number of tourists visiting New Hampshire from Canada has dropped around 30% this year, BEA Commissioner Taylor Caswell said earlier this month.
Animosity toward the United States, in addition to economic anxieties and fears about having trouble at the U.S. border have helped to contribute to the drop in tourism, Sylvestre said.
Before the trade war, there was “a kind of unconditional trust and love” between the countries,” he said. Now, feelings are unsettled.
“It’s really a perfect storm,” he said.
During Monday’s meeting, some said they have seen the effect of the drop in tourism. Janet Wall, a Madbury Democrat, noted that the Seacoast usually sees a late-summer burst of tourism from Canadians. This year, she said, beachside parking lots are not full, and business owners say there has been a “huge decline” in Canadian visitors.
McGough had a different take. Browsing the parking lots of the Merrimack Outlets this year, he has seen plenty of Québec license plates, he said.
The dip in tourism comes after New Hampshire and Canada were only just rebounding from the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the land border between the two countries was largely closed. In February 2024, Canadian Consul General for New England Bernadette Jordan paid a visit to the New Hampshire House to tout that turnaround.
“Whether it’s tourism, whether it’s trade, whether it’s people visiting families: We can’t impede that,” Jordan said in an interview with the Bulletin then. “But we still have to make sure that what we’re doing is still working. It does seem to be working.”
Today, under very different circumstances, Slyvestre hopes that that relationship will endure.
“I see this as one corridor,” he said. “Even though it’s two countries, there are so many things that we’re doing together.”

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read. 


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as 'The Job Chick' on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

There are two major narratives floating around. The “techno-optimist” view is that AI will free humans from boring tasks and create new jobs, while the “techno-pessimist” view is that AI will lead to widespread unemployment.
As a sociologist who studies job insecurity, I’m among the pessimists. And that’s not just because of AI itself. It’s about something deeper – what scholars call “American exceptionalism.” While people commonly use this phrase to refer to anything that makes the U.S. unique, I use it narrowly to refer to the country’s approach to work and social welfare, which is quite different from the systems in other rich countries.
I suspect AI will “turbocharge” American exceptionalism in ways that make workers more afraid of losing their jobs. When fused with organizations’ adoption of new types of AI, workers’ fears may soon become reality, if they haven’t already.
 An ‘exceptional’ system for American workers

Let’s start with what makes the U.S. different, especially from other rich countries.
The U.S. has relatively low levels of unionization, an “at-will” employment system, a modest welfare state, and a two-party system that lacks a social democratic tradition. Many wealthy countries boast higher unionization rates, stricter protections against being fired, and – particularly in Europe – more robust welfare states.
In other words, even before AI came into the picture, American workers were facing a system stacked against them.
This tendency grew more pronounced starting in the late 1970s, with Democrats and Republicans alike pursuing reforms such as stripping regulations and rolling back the welfare state. Between 1983 and 2022, unionization rates fell by more than 50%; they remain low today. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton pledged to “end welfare as we know it” and followed with a law slashing support programs. Meanwhile, U.S. workers’ inflation-adjusted wages have stagnated and income inequality has risen since the 1970s.
The current Trump administration has taken these “exceptional” traits even further. From firing the head of the National Labor Relations Board to his executive order undermining federal employee unions, Trump has usurped the power of regulatory agencies and workers themselves. And more cuts to the welfare state are coming now that Trump’s domestic policy bill has been signed into law, including reductions in food aid and health insurance.
One telling example is the Trump administration’s mass firing of federal workers. While they are making their way through the courts, these efforts are notable for targeting government positions that have long been thought to be the most secure jobs.
As a sociologist, I think it’s fair to say that the U.S. is even more “exceptional” than it was just a year ago. This trend lays the foundation for U.S. workers to fear losing their jobs, for employers to cut workers loose, and for people to struggle making ends meet.
 American exceptionalism, meet AI

To understand what’s happening, it helps to look at the different kinds of artificial intelligence, which generally refers to machines such as computers that can perform tasks comparably to humans.
One type is predictive AI, which is what powers your streaming and social media recommendations. The second type is generative AI, which is used to create seemingly novel content. ChatGPT and other large language models fall in this category. The third type, agentic AI, cannot only predict and plan outcomes but also can act autonomously to achieve those outcomes. Self-driving cars are perhaps the most well-known example.
Companies are increasingly using generative AI to boost productivity. According to Stanford University’s 2025 AI index report, generative AI has already surpassed human performance on a range of tasks, including visual reasoning and answering competition-level math and Ph.D.-level science questions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has warned that generative AI will affect jobs across a range of industries.
I think agentic AI will have dramatic implications for the workforce. Companies are already beginning to use it for customer service in industries from finance to travel. As if on cue, OpenAI recently released ChatGPT agent, which it says can handle “complex tasks from start to finish.”
When you combine technological advancements – such as the current transition to generative AI and the likely broader agentic AI transition – with turbocharged American exceptionalism, you get a formula for job insecurity and displacement.
 How AI might affect the future of job security

Interestingly, despite having fewer protections from firing and a more threadbare unemployment system, American workers are no more afraid of losing their jobs than workers in other rich countries, research shows. These perceptions are generally constant over time, but they spike as a result of certain economic reforms and during recessions.
Among the findings in my own research on free-market-driven economic reforms in Europe, people were most worried about losing their jobs in countries that had ratcheted up such policies within the past five years. That trend has important implications for the United States.
Recent polling shows that about a third of U.S. workers believe AI will hurt their jobs or job opportunities. Business leaders say they expect job losses in the service industries, supply chain management and human resources over the next three years.
There’s no shortage of predictions about AI-driven job gains and losses, but solid data is hard to come by – and don’t even bother asking most companies about AI-related layoffs.
On one hand, business leaders surveyed by McKinsey in 2024 reported high demand for new jobs such as “AI compliance specialist” and “AI ethics specialist,” which are the kinds of new roles that techno-optimists say will be created by AI.
On the other hand, it’s no small irony that AI was reportedly used to facilitate the mass firing of federal workers and may soon replace some Department of Education workers’ jobs.
America’s fusion of limited labor protections and aggressive AI adoption could create the perfect storm for widespread job insecurity. While unions have organized for AI-related job protections, and states are attempting to regulate AI, the U.S.’s path realistically depends less on workers’ and local politicians’ actions than what companies do. And I think companies’ increasing integration of AI will likely hurt American workers more than it helps.
If nothing changes, job insecurity may become the new normal.

Taylor Sisk for KFF Health NewsRebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan’s capital city that she never would have expected.
“It’s a very weird time in our lives,” said Kasen, executive director of the Women’s Center of Greater Lansing.
Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women’s Center staff reported being harassed.
A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by “First Amendment auditors” outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.
In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.
Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward “an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions.”
Researchers at American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, “hate is intersectional.” (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL’s director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of “A Minecraft Movie” prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.
The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.
The team defines extremism as the belief that one’s group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.
Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they’re on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)
Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s deputy director of prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that’s rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?
They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip “all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism” and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.
“We’re not about, ‘How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?’” Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL’s deputy director of regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. “Rather, ‘How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?’”
Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.
The state’s capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.
Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer’s covid lockdown directives.
Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about “how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible.”
The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and “Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry.”
Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.
The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.
Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She’s a proponent of the public health approach. It’s “providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward,” she said. It’s a way to channel energy “and feel like you can actually create change with community.”
Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.
In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” at an American Legion post.
In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book “They She He Me: Free to Be!” Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.
“It’s really important that rural communities not be left behind,” Flanagan said. “They persistently are in America, and then they’re often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges.”
The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children’s Hospital’s Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City’s Citizens Crime Commission.
And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.
Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism’s having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. “It’s just devastating,” he said. “It’s really startling.”
Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, “I would say now it has been completely shattered.” Violent extremists now feel “unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back.”
“We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime,” Simi said.
The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people’s lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.
“If you have a germ out there,” Whitaker said, “and people aren’t aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it’s an actual problem, you won’t enact basic protective behavior.”

In light of an opinion issued Tuesday by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, the American Civil Liberties Union said that eight Ohio counties don’t have legal contracts with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. That being the case, the ACLU of Ohio said, those detainees must be released.
However, one Ohio sheriff’s office said its contract with the feds meets the legal standards Yost laid out. Another said he’ll fix any problems, but he’s not releasing anybody.
For its part, Yost’s office declined to answer questions.
After taking office in January, President Donald Trump swiftly began implementing his policy of mass deportation. It was sold on promises that he would throw out violent criminals, but only 7% of those deported have been convicted of violent crimes.
Meanwhile, stories are accumulating of dodgy cases against beloved asylum seekers. Claims of human rights abuses are mounting. And some economists predict that removing so many from the workforce will make already-high inflation even worse.
Once a strong issue for Trump, by mid-July, just 35% of Americans approved of his handling of immigration, according to a Gallup Poll.
But regardless of the issue’s popularity, Ohio sheriffs have an incentive to take in ICE detainees. They get $125 per-person, per-day, while the feds cover most of their non-food expenses. That revenue has helped fill gaps in their budgets, one Ohio sheriff said.
In an opinion published Tuesday, Yost seemed to raise doubts about the legality of at least some of the arrangements. In response to a query from the Butler County Prosecutor’s Office, the attorney general said county jails could hold ICE detainees longer than 48 hours, and they could provide services such as transport — but only under contracts between the feds and the county commissioners.
“The board of county commissioners may enter into an agreement with federal immigration authorities, on behalf of the sheriff, to detain aliens subject to removal in the county jail,” the opinion said. “The sheriff, however, does not have independent contracting authority for this purpose.” 
At least two of the eight Ohio counties contracting to hold ICE detainees — Butler and Mahoning — are doing so after modifying contracts to hold prisoners on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service. The ACLU of Ohio on Wednesday said that wasn’t sufficient.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Attorney General Yost has made abundantly clear that all county agreements with ICE must be authorized by the board of county commissioners,” Freda Levenson, the group’s legal director, said in a written statement. “County sheriffs cannot bootstrap themselves into having this authority. Striking these agreements means there is no legal authority to hold the immigrants currently incarcerated in our county jails. The people detained under these invalid agreements are being held unconstitutionally and must be released immediately.” 
The attorney general’s office was asked if the ACLU was correct in saying that Yost’s ruling meant that hundreds of detainees were being held in Ohio illegally. It declined to answer.
“Your question is different than the specific question asked by the Butler County Prosecuting Attorney and we offer no answer in response — our office does not issue legal opinions or guidance to nonclients,” Steven Irwin, a spokesman, said in an email. “The opinion issued to the Butler County Prosecuting Attorney addressed a specific, narrow question on a positive power of government. We have nothing more to say at this time.”
The ACLU said eight county sheriffs offices had improper ICE agreements: Those in Butler, Fairfield, Fayette, Geauga, Lake, Portage, Mahoning and Seneca counties.
However, Butler County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Anthony E. Dwyer on Thursday said county commissioners there had signed off on his department’s arrangement with the feds. He sent along the commissioners’ resolution approving the modification of a contract to take in prisoners of the Marshals Service to also allow the jail to take ICE detainees. 
“We got that agreement signed off on by the county commissioners,” Dwyer said in an interview. “The ACLU is a little mistaken about what they’re saying about Butler County.”
He added, “People have regularly come to commissioners meetings and talked about it, so it’s shocking that they’re that far behind that they don’t know that.”
Butler County housed 303 ICE detainees on Thursday. Mahoning County Jail in Northeast Ohio houses around 100 on a normal day. 
Sheriff Jerry Greene was asked whether Yost’s opinion affected the legality of their detention.
“The answer is I don’t know at this point,” he said in an interview Thursday. “I’m not sure if the commissioners would be considered as officially parties to the contract. When we put it together, they were definitely in the know and we informed them every step of the way.”
As for the ACLU’s call to release the detainees, Greene was adamant.
“The answer is absolutely not,” he said. “I am doing this to support the federal government. We have housed federal inmates for years. We’re definitely going to make sure we’re constitutional and following the law… but I’m not releasing anybody. We’ll remedy it as soon as possible.”

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”
Conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ people, long discredited, could make a comeback

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

For years, anti-renewable-energy advocates have opposed solar and wind projects on the grounds that they take up too much land. Now those talking points, popularized by groups linked to the fossil-fuel industry, have made their way into a sweeping new directive from the Trump administration.


On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated that federal leasing decisions factor in ​“capacity density” for solar and wind projects.


His order defines ​“capacity density” as the amount of electricity a proposed facility is expected to produce, as a share of the maximum ​“nameplate” amount, divided by the site’s total acres. An appendix to the order shows that nuclear and combined-cycle gas plants rank highest on this measure, while renewables come in last.


The Interior Department will now have to consider the density measure in environmental reviews. With that in mind, the order questions whether the law allows any federal land use for wind and solar projects, ​“given these projects’ encumbrance on other land uses, as well as their disproportionate land use.”


Only a small portion of solar and wind projects are located on areas owned and managed by the U.S. government, but there is vast potential for development. A January 2025 report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that 1,300 gigawatts of solar and 60 GW of onshore wind could be cost-effectively built on public lands, and that significant deployment in those spaces would be needed to meet grid-decarbonization goals.


It’s unclear whether the order might also block some projects on private property if they require reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act.


The directive is yet another example of the Trump administration’s push to slow the development of solar and wind, which together with batteries will account for more than 90% of new utility-scale energy-capacity additions this year. But more broadly, it illustrates how the administration is elevating fossil-fuel-backed misinformation about land use into federal energy policy.


“This is the latest sign that the Trump administration is really just relying on political talking points to push back on renewable energy that have little or no basis in fact,” said Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that focuses on the fossil-fuel and utility industries.


 The density debate

Before ​“capacity density” became a factor in federal leasing decisions, anti-renewable-energy groups were using the argument to build local opposition to utility-scale clean-power projects across the country.


The battle over a now-approved solar project in central Ohio provides a case in point.


In November 2023, a group called Knox Smart Development held a town-hall meeting to stoke opposition to the proposed 120-megawatt Frasier agrivoltaics project.


Canary Media (then the Energy News Network) confirmed last year that one of the main funders of the group was Tom Rastin, former vice president of Ariel Corp., which makes compressors for the oil and gas industry. Rastin and his wife, Karen Buchwald Wright, who is the company’s board chair, also play large roles in The Empowerment Alliance, a pro-natural-gas group.


Steve Goreham, a policy advisor to conservative think tank The Heartland Institute, was one of the speakers at the 2023 event.


In addition to denying that climate change requires a shift away from fossil fuels, Goreham told people at the Knox County meeting that solar farms require much more land than nuclear, gas, and coal-fired power plants. He also focused on ​“power density” in a 2023 opinion piece for the conservative-leaning Western Journal, warning that ​“environmental devastation” will result from policies that aim to accomplish net-zero carbon emissions. Goreham repeated this land-use argument in a Real Clear Energy post in March.

A Heartland Institute policy brief released this spring also relied on information about the land areas needed for solar and wind energy to conclude that large-scale electricity production from those sources ​“requires substantial ecological damage and impact.” The institute’s funders have included Exxon Mobil, coal-mining company Murray Energy (now American Consolidated Natural Resources), and foundations supported by the Koch brothers.


Another speaker at Knox Smart Development’s town hall, a lobbyist named Mitch Given, had previously represented The Empowerment Alliance in a 2023 presentation to the Ohio legislature’s Business First Caucus. His slides on the ​“nonsense of turning corn fields into solar fields” compared 6,050 acres for an Ohio solar project to just 5 acres for a similar-sized combined-cycle gas power plant.


A 2024 rally against the Frasier agrivoltaics project then brought in Robert Bryce, a former Manhattan Institute fellow who spent an entire chapter of his 2010 book arguing that wind and solar energy are not green because of their land use and power density. The argument is also featured in an anti-solar video he released this month.


The Manhattan Institute has received funding from fossil-fuel interests, such as Exxon Mobil and organizations linked to the Koch brothers. The Checks and Balances Project, a pro-clean-energy watchdog group, has criticized Bryce multiple times for failing to disclose those links. Bryce did not respond to Canary Media’s request for comment for this story.


“Everybody needs to come to this debate with a full picture of who they’re talking to and why they’re saying what they’re saying,” said Ray Locker, executive director for the Checks and Balances Project. Companies in the fossil-fuel industry ​“have a vested interest in preserving their business,” so when they present renewable energy ​“as somehow dirty, then that furthers their interest.”


This month’s Interior Department order is not the only recent federal attack on clean energy based on the land-use argument. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that the agency’s longstanding Rural Energy for America Program would no longer fund large solar projects on ​“prime farmland,” a major shift for a program whose main use case has been helping farmers install solar energy.


 “An absurd metric”

Burgum’s order to the Department of the Interior is ​“really implementing an ideological agenda,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at think tank Energy Innovation. In his view, the mandate’s definition of capacity density is an ​“absurd metric,” with multiple flaws.


Among other things, the capacity-density measurement does not capture the full picture of what it takes to produce electricity from a fossil-fueled or nuclear power plant.


The metric focuses only on the step where electricity is generated. A full life-cycle analysis would consider all stages for producing equipment, obtaining and transporting fuel, and dealing with waste. The Interior Department’s recent order is ​“entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.


The definition of capacity density also fails to account for the fact that renewable projects can coexist with other activities, such as livestock grazing or farming certain crops, noted Matthias Fripp, global policy research director at Energy Innovation.


Additionally, land used for solar or wind energy can produce electricity for decades, he said, unlike fossil fuels, where the industry must ​“keep finding new land” for resource extraction. Researchers made a similar point in a 2016 study in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, which found the land requirements for coal-fired electricity could equal or exceed those for renewable energy within two to 31 years.


Anderson at the Energy and Policy Institute called the rationale for the Interior Department’s order ​“a red-herring argument to focus on just one of the impacts of different energy sources.”


Nowhere does the order address environmental and health concerns about mining for coal or uranium, drilling for oil and gas, or transporting and burning those fuels. Waste disposal, particularly for coal and nuclear plants, also poses a challenge.


Renewables ​“are obviously leaps and bounds ahead of fossil fuels in terms of their net benefits,” Anderson said.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)During the 2024 election campaign, the Republican Party’s historically fraught relationship with organized labor appeared to be changing. Several influential Republicans reached out to unions, seeking to cement the loyalties of the growing ranks of working-class Americans who have been backing Donald Trump’s presidential runs and voting for other members of his party.
During Trump’s first bid for the White house, the percentage of votes in households where at least one person belongs to a union fell to its lowest level in decades. In 2021, Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator at the time, wrote a USA Today op-ed supporting a unionization drive at an Amazon facility. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, walked a United Auto Workers picket line in 2023 in solidarity with striking workers.
As the 2024 GOP presidential nominee, Trump spotlighted International Brotherhood of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien with a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention — rewarding the union for staying neutral in that campaign after endorsing Joe Biden four years earlier.
Yet O’Brien shocked many in the convention crowd by lambasting longtime GOP coalition partners such as the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable for hurting American workers.
Once in office, Trump continued to signal some degree of solidarity with the blue-collar voters who backed him. He chose former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Teamsters ally, to be his second-term labor secretary.
I’m a sociologist who has been researching the U.S. labor movement for over two decades. Given conservatives’ long-standing antipathy toward unions, I was curious whether the GOP’s greater engagement with labor portended any kind of change in its policies.
 
Fumbled at the starting line
The GOP’s various outreach efforts during the 2024 campaign led University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, a scholar of declining labor power, to write, “Is a pro-labor Republican Party possible?”
More than six months into Trump’s second term, I would say that based on the evidence thus far the answer to Posner’s question is a resounding no.
In late March 2025, Trump issued an executive order stripping hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their collective bargaining rights.
Overnight, twice as many federal employees lost their union protections as there are members of the United Auto Workers union, making the action “the largest and most aggressive single act of union-busting in U.S. history,” according to Georgetown University labor historian Joseph McCartin.
While affected unions have challenged that action and similar subsequent ones in court, the Trump administration is moving onto other agencies. In August, over 400,000 federal employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs and Environmental Protection Agency saw their union contracts terminated and their collective bargaining rights dissolved.
Everett Kelley, the American Federation of Government Employees president, described the attacks on federal workers as a “setback for fundamental rights in America.”
 
Tariffs, other policies aren’t helping
The Trump administration has pitched its erratic tariff policies as a boon to U.S.manufacturing, including in the automotive industry, once the foundation of the U.S. labor movement.
In reality, U.S. car producers are struggling to keep up with rising tariff-related costs of raw materials and parts. The number of factory jobs has fallen to the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, a supporter of targeted tariffs to buttress the domestic auto industry, criticized the administration’s trade policy in April 2025, saying, “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”
Other administration actions cast as relief for struggling workers are unlikely to deliver as advertised. The “no tax on tips” provision in Trump’s huge tax-and-spending package excludes the nearly 40% of tipped workers whose earnings fall below the federal income tax threshold. Tipped workers make up a tiny share of the low-wage workforce.
Culinary Workers Local 226, a powerful Nevada union representing many tipped workers in Las Vegas and Reno, supported the provision. Yet it blasted the overall package, calling it a “big, horrible bill” for its windfalls to the rich instead of the working class.
 
Removing the watchdogs
The National Labor Relations Board is responsible for ensuring management and labor adhere to provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. Passed in 1935, that law established workers’ fundamental rights to collective bargaining. The board is responsible for conducting union elections, investigating allegations of unfair labor practices and outright abuses by employers, and enforcing court orders when employers or unions are found to have broken labor laws.
Presidents regularly use vacancies to tilt the ideological balance of the board to a more or less labor-friendly position. Trump, however, went further.
Soon after he was sworn in for a second term, Trump fired the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel along with board member Gwynne Wilcox, who was only halfway through her five-year term. Wilcox’s dismissal was unprecedented and violated the National Labor Relations Act provision on board personnel changes.
Wilcox’s removal left the body without a quorum, preventing it from responding to appeals or requests for review and allowing employers accused of violating workers’ rights to delay any settlement. The Trump administration has left those important NLRB jobs vacant for months, although it has nominated two management-friendly replacements, both of whom awaited Senate approval in mid-August.
In the meantime, the agency is unable to hear labor disputes.
Disempowering the NLRB is a long-standing Republican tactic, suggesting more continuity with past GOP attacks on labor than a new era of partnership
 
Hawley standing out
To be sure, Republicans don’t all agree with one another on the importance of supporting workers and labor rights. One who has stood out so far is Hawley. The relatively pro-labor Republican senator’s stance led him to partner with Sen. Corey Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to co-sponsor the Faster Labor Contracts Act.
This new bill would force employers to negotiate a contract in a reasonable time frame with employees once they have voted in favor of forming a union.
Hawley also joined with Democrats to reintroduce a bill that would ban dangerous work speed requirements in warehouses. Hawley said, when summarizing his efforts on behalf of working people, “It’s time we deliver for them.”
The Missouri senator is not completely alone. Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Roger Marshall of Kansas, both Republicans, have backed some labor-friendly legislation in the spring and summer of this year.
GOP leaders in Congress are not moving those bills forward so far, likely in part due to pushback from Republicans and their allies outside Congress.
And there are limits to Hawley’s labor friendliness. He voted for Trump’s tax-and-spending package, despite publicly airing his misgivings about the harm it may cause his blue-collar constituents.
Meanwhile, his past partners in the more labor-friendly wing of the GOP now occupy prominent administration posts. Yet they have largely fallen silent on union issues — except, in Rubio’s case, to oversee the firing of well over 1,000 State Department employees, many of them members of the American Foreign Service Association union.
 
Trump labor approach echoes Reagan’s style
Another GOP presidential administration courted segments of the labor movement to divide a key Democratic constituency, only to take actions that weakened unions.
In 1980, for example, Ronald Reagan sought and won the endorsement of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. A year later, he fired 13,000 striking members of that union.
The Teamsters union also backed Reagan — twice. It endorsed him in 1980 after he pledged during the 1980 campaign not to pursue anti-labor policies. Although he broke his promise, personal outreach from Vice President George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the 1984 election earned him the Teamsters endorsement a second time.
What seems clear in my view is that whenever the GOP has tried to cast itself as a labor-friendly political party, it has emphasized symbolism over substance, favoring using rhetoric embracing workers who belong to unions versus taking actions to strengthen labor rights.

Outside of racial violence, many of the most notorious massacres in U.S. history happened when government and big business teamed up to use sheriffs offices, the National Guard, federal troops, and/or private security goons to break up organized labor with extreme violence:
The 1892 Homestead Massacre, the 1894 Pullman Strike, the 1897 Lattimer Massacre, the 1903-04 Colorado Labor Wars, the 1914 Ludlow Massacre, the 1937 Memorial Day Massacre, and the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain in West Virginia, which still stands as the largest armed uprising in America since the Civil War. It was also a tremendous defeat for labor, put down by the U.S. Army, and coal workers were unable to really recover their unions until the mid-1930s, deep into the Great Depression.
Perhaps Cleveland-born folk singer and labor activist Utah Phillips put it best:

        “Kids don’t have a little brother working in the coal mine, they don’t have a little sister coughing her lungs out in the looms of the big mill towns of the Northeast. Why? Because we organized; we broke the back of the sweatshops in this country; we have child labor laws. Those were not benevolent gifts from enlightened management. They were fought for, they were bled for, they were died for by working people, by people like us. Kids ought to know that. That’s why I sing these songs. That’s why I tell these stories, dammit. No root, no fruit!”

Take the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 mentioned above. United Mine Workers of America went on strike in Colorado and on April 20, 1914, workers and their families were attacked by the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel & Iron Company camp guards.
The Colorado National Guard encircled the Ludlow camp and used a machine gun on a bluff overlooking the strikers. When strikers ran out of ammunition to fight back and ran away, the National Guard descended on the camp and set tents on fire with kerosene.
More than two dozen people were killed, including miners’ wives and children. Public outcry after the massacre is credited as a contributor to anti-child labor laws and the eight-hour workday.
Then there’s the story of how Labor Day came to be a national holiday in the first place.
In the summer of 1894, Eugene V. Debs organized the American Railway Union’s strike against the Pullman Company.
U.S. President Grover Cleveland obtained an injunction against the striking workers and ordered the U.S. Army in to enforce it, killing 13 people in the process. In an effort to assuage bad feelings after these events, Cleveland declared Labor Day a federal holiday.
On 4th Street in downtown Columbus, Ohio, just south of Town Street, sits a historical marker. At that site, on Dec. 10, 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Union merged with trade unionists of the Knights of Labor to create the American Federation of Labor.
They also elected Samuel Gompers president of the newly formed AFL, a predicate organization to the modern AFL-CIO.
“What does labor want?” Gompers considered.
“We want more schoolhouses and less jails; more books and less arsenals; more learning and less vice; more leisure and less greed; more justice and less revenge; in fact, more of the opportunities to cultivate our better natures, to make manhood more noble, womanhood more beautiful, and childhood more happy and bright.”

Dr. Rana Alissa hears it daily in the clinic.
“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Labor Day, appropriately, does some annual heavy lifting. It’s the calendar demarcation between summer and fall, although the equinox remains three weeks away. The holiday in the past also marked the last day before school started, but those academic calendars in this part of the world are relics. Oh, and that whole wearing white thing? No longer a thing. 
Most importantly, however, Labor Day serves as a reminder of those American workers who built a nation and keep it running every day, whether their collars be blue or white, their work stations be offices, surgery suites, classrooms, firehouses, squadcars, highways, retail stores, restaurants or any of the hundreds of places we toil to keep the nation moving. 
We take the first Monday in September to celebrate, usually with picnics, parades or private gatherings on patios everywhere. The public confabs usually attract politicians: those in office touting their bona fides when it comes to working men and women and those running for office selling the same with a side of name recognition. Both groups join the festivities to give speeches, kiss babies and generally glad-hand over beers, brats and a day away from work.
What better time than Labor Day, then, to break out this space’s periodic imaginary press conference for Nebraska’s congressional delegation and its governor? As usual, we have questions:

Last week two children, 8 and 10, were murdered while attending Mass at their Catholic school in Minneapolis. The shooter opened fire into the church with an AR-15 assault rifle. Aside from thoughts and prayers and the billions of dollars cut from mental health programs since January, what are your ideas to curb mass shootings in the U.S., of which the Minneapolis shooting was the nation’s 286 version of this modern mayhem?


Using whatever statistical reference you choose, crime in Washington D.C. was at a 30-year low when the president deployed troops there because of … well … crime. He’s threatening to do the same in Chicago, Baltimore and elsewhere and has done so in Los Angeles, bringing about much needed discussion from the Posse Comitatus Act to the hollowing out of ongoing community-police partnerships that reduce crime. What would your reaction be to federal troops on the streets of Omaha or Lincoln if the government — without evidence — insisted crime there was out of control?


As a follow up to the troops now roaming the streets of the nation’s capital, does it strike any of you as painfully ironic that those same National Guard units were not called up for hours while a mob ransacked the Capitol building and tried to overturn a free and fair election? 


Nebraska is now home to an immigration detention camp, heralded as “doing our part.” Proclamations assert the facility is about safety rather immigration. Do any of you have real, empirical evidence that immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than we native born do and that fentanyl crosses the border in higher numbers somewhere other than legal checkpoints, because a survey of current data shows that neither is true?


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells us no one is starving in Gaza while during every news cycle we see searing images that reveal he is just plain wrong. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said aid is being sent to Gaza but that Hamas has stolen it, a charge that aid workers on the ground say is misleading, that, even factoring in theft, there simply is not enough aid being allowed into the country to stave off what is now a famine. What is U.S.’s responsibility to the noncombatants and children of Gaza as they face imminent death?


Speaking of responsibilities, what does Congress owe its constituents — in this case Nebraskans — when a branch of the federal government acts beyond its purview or authority? Please respond specifically to a promise of an executive order to do away with mail-in ballots and voting machines, clearly outside the scope of executive power.


What would you think of the federal government simply admitting it made a mistake (as it did in the beginning of this sad saga) when it arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and everyone just moved on?


Finally, do you ever question why (with two of your votes) we’ve turned over the nation’s health and medical efficacy to a vaccine skeptic who, without education, experience or expertise in science, medicine, epidemiology or research, has gutted health research and limited the availability of a vaccine that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives? Asking for 340 million friends.

Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care, and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia, and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York, and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%), and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%), and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.
In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont, and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

The report, “A Snapshot of Michigan’s Workforce,” determined that Michigan had the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the nation at 5.3% as of June 2025, compared to the national average of 4.1%. 
Meanwhile, more than half of Michigan’s counties — 54 out of 83 — reported unemployment rates of 6% or higher, with rural communities hit the hardest.

The report also found that workers’ real earnings are being eroded as wage growth in Michigan is being outpaced by rising costs, with 27% of Michiganders reported to be employed, but under the classification of “asset-limited and income-constrained,” otherwise referred to as ALICE.

“The median wage for Black workers in the state remains significantly lower than white workers, sitting at $20.17, which is 21.6% lower than the median wage of white workers,” the report said. “It is no surprise that as a result, 42% of Black Michiganders find themselves below the ALICE threshold.”
The report notes that the income gap is even slightly larger for Hispanic Michiganders, with median wages about 23% lower than that of white workers.
The report links declining union membership and what it terms as “state-level anti-worker policies” to stagnant wages and reduced protections for employees. 
As a result, it calls for a reversal of laws such as Public Act 98 of 2011, which limits the ability for builder trade unions to negotiate terms of employment, and Public Act 105 of 2015, which limits local governmental bodies from regulating employment terms. 
The league says taken together, the pair of laws have weakened labor protections and hindered local governments’ ability to promote fair labor standards.
The league’s recommendations to strengthen Michigan’s economy and support its workforce include:

Increasing the minimum wage to a living wage and eliminating the sub-minimum tipped wage.
Investing in public transit and K-12 education, and reducing the cost of post-secondary training and college.
Expanding access to affordable child care through increased scholarship reimbursements for providers, which could also help address the ongoing shortage of child care workers.
Making construction and skilled trades jobs more attractive by repealing laws that limit collective bargaining and labor standards.

“While there is an overall job shortage in Michigan, there are some sectors of the state’s workforce where workers are urgently needed. This includes the child care and construction workforce,” Stanton said. “If we want Michigan to be a state where working families can raise young children and support the growing demand for newly built homes, we need to be making the jobs in those industries more desirable for prospective candidates.”
Stanton said that improving compensation and working conditions in these sectors, which she says are often dominated by women and people of color, is essential to building a more equitable and resilient state economy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut can’t afford another $500m on our electric bills,Laura Francis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/01/connecticut-cant-afford-another-500m-on-our-electric-bills/,Why should all Connecticut ratepayers be stuck with the bill for undergrounding lines in Fairfield County?,"As Executive Director of the South Central Connecticut Council of Governments (SCRCOG), I speak often with municipal leaders, business owners, and residents about one of Connecticut’s most pressing concerns: the high cost of electricity.
Energy costs affect everything we care about — attracting jobs, retaining families, and maintaining a livable cost of living. Yet Connecticut’s electric rates are already among the highest in the country, and without careful decisions, they will only climb higher.
From conversations with UI, Eversource, and energy experts, I know the reasons are complex. Utility infrastructure is heavily taxed, with those costs passed directly to consumers. More than half of our power comes from natural gas that must be transported hundreds of miles, adding costs at every step. State policies have also layered more and more programs onto electric bills over time.
These factors aren’t easy to solve, but one thing is clear: we must avoid adding unnecessary costs. That’s why I’m deeply concerned about a proposal under review by the Connecticut Siting Council — the request to bury seven miles of high-voltage transmission lines in Fairfield and part of Bridgeport by a vocal minority of Fairfield County residents and some of their elected officials.
If approved, this project would add approximately $500 million to electric bills statewide.
For years, UI has been rebuilding transmission lines across its service area to replace aging infrastructure and improve reliability. In New Haven, West Haven, Milford, Stratford, and other towns, these upgrades have been completed overhead — the most cost-efficient approach — with little controversy.
But in Fairfield and Bridgeport, a small group of residents, businesses, and nonprofits has been lobbying for an underground solution. While their preference is understandable, it’s important to recognize who would pay for that decision.
Under New England’s rules, the costs of standard overhead transmission projects are shared among all 14 million regional ratepayers. But any additional costs — including underground installation — fall entirely on Connecticut customers. That means residents and businesses across Connecticut – not just Fairfield and Bridgeport, but also in 167 other cities and towns – would be forced to subsidize a project that benefits only two of our state’s communities.
Put simply: Connecticut ratepayers would bear the approximately $500 million burden so a few neighborhoods in Fairfield County could get a gold-plated solution.
You might expect widespread opposition to such an inequitable proposal. Yet surprisingly few elected officials have spoken out. Most of the lawmakers who have weighed in — from both parties — represent Fairfield, Bridgeport, or nearby towns, and many have called an underground option the “only acceptable” outcome.
I understand the pressure they face. Local officials must represent their constituents, and the most vocal voices in their districts are demanding undergrounding. But this is precisely when leaders from across Connecticut must step forward to defend the interests of the broader public.
This isn’t just an energy issue. It’s a matter of fairness, economic competitiveness, and protecting the residents and employers who power Connecticut’s economy.
The Connecticut Siting Council has not yet made its decision on this proposal, though they are expected to in the coming weeks. I urge elected officials, community leaders, and residents across the state to speak up. Contact your legislators. Submit comments to the Siting Council. Raise awareness within your communities. The voices of a vocal minority should not outweigh the needs of the many.
Connecticut families and businesses cannot afford another $500 million on our electric bills. We need thoughtful, disciplined decisions that protect affordability and fairness for everyone — not just a select few.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Speaking to a crowd of more than 200 in a Raleigh town hall, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) denounced President Donald Trump’s treatment of veterans, calling cuts to veterans affairs and the firing of veterans in government “devastating.”
“He doesn’t understand us, he doesn’t understand service, he doesn’t understand sacrifice to this nation and sacrifice before self,” Kelly said. “That’s why you see the attacks on veterans and institutions that support veterans, whether it’s the VA or just the firing of so many veterans in government jobs after their service.”
Kelly, a 24-year U.S. military veteran who began as a naval aviator before his selection as an astronaut in 1996, condemned the president for calling Marines who died in combat “suckers” and “losers” during his first term, comments reported by Trump’s former chief of staff, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general.
“How many veterans are in his family? Zero,” Kelly said. “His family didn’t serve, and I think that’s one of the reasons he feels this way.”
A swing state Senate Democrat with broad popularity — a May survey by Noble Predictive Insights showed him with +15 favorability — Kelly is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, but said he was in North Carolina to support veterans and former Gov. Roy Cooper’s 2026 U.S. Senate bid. He was in Asheville on Saturday and will be in Charlotte on Monday with his wife former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords.
He was joined by state party chair Anderson Clayton in Asheville. For the Raleigh town hall, which was comprised mainly of military veterans and their families, he spoke alongside Attorney General Jeff Jackson, an Army National Guard Major.

Jackson said he was proud his office helped fend off efforts to toss out military and overseas ballots in North Carolina’s 2024 state Supreme Court election, praising “the civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to sticking up for you and defending the Constitution.”
“We’ve got five or six people who you will never meet who spent a straight seven months on this case — no time off, no vacation, not for the holidays, not for birthdays, not for families because this was that important,” he said.
Jackson also touted the N.C. Department of Justice’s support for a challenge to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ cancelation of collective bargaining agreements with government workers’ unions, drawing applause from veterans in the audience.
“This is an attack on working class folks, right? I mean, unions help raise wages and benefits for working class people. That’s why they want to get rid of union participation at the VA and make it harder for people to organize and fight for higher wages and healthcare and those kinds of benefits,” Kelly said.
Kelly staked out a guarded position on relations with China, calling the country a “pure adversary” and telling audience members concerned about rising tensions between the two nations that an invasion of Taiwan would prompt “the hardest decision any president has to make about whether or not we get into a war with China.”
“I think we’ve got to take every step possible to avoid getting in a conflict with another country that has a significant nuclear arsenal, so I worry about China a lot,” Kelly said. “Right now, I think in a conflict with China, we would prevail. Is that going to be true 10 years from now? I’m not so sure.”
One of several Democrats vetted as a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Kelly has spoken in several key states this year, including Michigan in July and South Carolina in June, traditionally the site of the first-in-the-South presidential primary.

Talking to reporters after the event, Kelly declined to answer whether he was considering a 2028 presidential campaign, saying he is “really focused on 2026 — that is the election that matters.”
He said he traveled to North Carolina to speak to veterans who don’t have veteran representation in Congress and to support Cooper’s campaign. “I want to do everything I can to help him get elected because I think the path to taking back control of the United States Senate goes right through North Carolina.”
He told the town hall crowd that he sees an opportunity to flip the U.S. Senate in 2026 amid growing disapproval of the Trump administration’s handling of the economy and immigration as well as its attacks on institutions.
“If you had asked me three or four months ago, I would have said, probably not possible that we take back the Senate,” Kelly said. “It is today, especially with Roy Cooper running.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8313416-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-31 19:56:53.157472

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)On Saturday, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a new health order regarding access to COVID-19 vaccines.
According to a news release, the order follows “some pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter.”
The order directs the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but with new restrictions. As noted in the new health order, people over the age of 65 are eligible, under the new FDA rules, for the vaccine, with younger people requiring an underlying medical issue for eligibility.  According to the news release, the state anticipates the updated COVID-19 vaccine to begin arriving in New Mexico in the next few weeks.
“It’s important for New Mexicans to know the New Mexico Department of Health is committed to keeping residents safe as we enter the 2025 – 2026 respiratory virus season,” Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “This order will remove obstacles to vaccination access.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)GRAND ISLAND — The Nebraska State Fair started Aug. 22 with Gov. Jim Pillen and retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., talking from the Earl May Fair Square Stage about their love of the fair. 
Pillen said the fair gets “better and better each year.” Bacon called it “such a treat” to be there. Pillen said it’s important to appreciate “who we are as Nebraskans.” Bacon said he enjoys how the fair celebrates agriculture.  
While the stock shows and food are the main attractions at the fair — which is older than the state itself, the state’s political parties and politicians still engage in politics there, as Republican and Democratic Party leaders view it as a great way to connect with Nebraskans.
“For many people, the fair may be their only face-to-face interaction with the party outside of campaign season,” a Nebraska GOP spokesperson said. “It’s a chance to listen, to build relationships, and to remind folks that the Republican Party is part of the Nebraska tradition, just like the fair itself.”
Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb calls the fair an excellent opportunity for Democrats to meet voters where they are — and to enjoy a beef sundae, a fair concoction of mashed potatoes, shredded beef and cheese and sour cream, topped with cherry tomatoes to resemble an ice cream sundae.
“We must be there to represent, provide valuable party and candidate information, register voters and visit with Nebraskans who want a better future for our state and country,” Kleeb said.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who had a booth of his own, said, “Nothing surpasses being able to talk face-to-face with Nebraskans and hear their thoughts” about the state.
There might be a chance for fairgoers to spot state senators such as Stan Clouse and Loren Lippincott, as well as members of the federal delegation, including 3rd District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, walking past a combine.
Kathleen Lodl, 4-H Program Administrator and an ex-officio member of the State Fair’s Executive Board, said fairs are a chance for people to come together to share ideas, so it makes sense why political parties and candidates show up.

The political presence is a bit different than in past fairs, as one Nebraska State Fair tradition is fading — candidate debates. 
The most recent traditional State Fair debates came in 2018, when U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., debated State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a member of the Lincoln City Council at the time, and then-Gov. Pete Ricketts debated State Sen. Bob Krist of Omaha for governor.

In 2022, there were no debates at the State Fair between Pillen and former State Sen. Carol Blood for governor, as Pillen chose not to debate. Nor was there a fair debate between former State Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks and 1st Congressional District U.S. Representative Mike Flood. 
During his 2024 bid against Fischer, registered nonpartisan Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn pushed to debate Fischer at the fair, but she and her campaign declined. Smith and his 2024 Democratic challenger, Daniel Ebers, didn’t debate either.
Former Nebraska State Fair Executive Director Bill Ogg said he didn’t get an inquiry about a State Fair debate in 2022 — which he considered surprising. 
“It’s customary to debate at the Nebraska State Fair, a tradition…” Osborn said in his campaign video last year. 
Lodl said fewer candidates need to reach broad in-person audiences like those at the fair because “communication media has changed.”  
“So now instead of having to go to a public debate … we see those on TV so that they can hit a wider audience of people. And so it wasn’t necessary to have a public platform,” Lodl said. 
Some candidates also turn down media-sponsored debates.
Osborn attended the fair last week as an audience member for now-U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ federal issues forum. Ricketts faced a few hecklers and outbursts on Friday and defended his support for the tax and spending measure President Donald Trump labeled the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

At one point, an audience member yelled, “You’re a f— traitor, Pete!”
While there were occasional outbursts, most of the central Nebraska crowd supported Ricketts. The forum featured panels from Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and U.S. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming. Barraso and Ricketts talked about the benefits of preserving the tax cuts from Trump’s first term and how Republicans’ new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps are modest. 
Ricketts and other officials took no questions from the audience. Ricketts told the Examiner that despite the outbursts, the forum “went wonderfully well” and said such forums give people an opportunity to “hear directly what’s going on in Washington, D.C.”  
Osborn criticized Ricketts’ defense of the bill, saying in a social media post that the “math doesn’t add up.” He said the emergency funds for rural hospitals Congress put in the tax and spending bill weren’t enough to replace the same bill’s longer-term cuts to Medicaid.  
In modern politics, Osborn’s post and any Ricketts responses might be the closest voters get to a political debate at the fair, but both Ricketts and Osborn have expressed a willingness to debate during the 2026 race. 
Over at the Pinnacle Bank Expo Center, fairgoers walking near the political booths showed mild interest in what the booths offered. 
The state GOP booth featured cutouts of President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, tables filled with pamphlets from Republican candidates and yard signs. Fairgoers could test their knowledge of the Constitution with a small sign wheel. 
Nebraska Republican Party Chair Mary Jane Truemper, who manned the GOP booth on Friday, said her public interactions were positive, adding that people seem to really like Vance.

Some fairgoers took pictures with the presidential and vice presidential cutouts. Trumper said booth volunteers saw a few people who gave them side eye as they walked by the booth. 
The Democrats’ booth offered information about how to get involved with the party and a pamphlet resembling a newspaper, featuring a headline, “Democrats win big,” with a picture of Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., who defeated Incumbent Republican Mayor Jean Stothert this year. 
Volunteers at the booth said that the people who typically visit are already Democrats. Still, they see it as an opportunity to recruit them to volunteer for the party and its candidates.

Larry Rhoden.
He said the mobilization comes at the request of President Donald Trump. Rhoden said South Dakota “stands in solidarity” with the president’s efforts.
“With the National Guard’s help, President Trump has restored law and order to our nation’s capital – and our guardsmen will help keep it that way,” Rhoden said. “We will not sit on the sidelines while crime threatens the safety of our families.”
Trump creates ‘quick reaction force’ out of state Guard troops for law enforcement

The 12 soldiers are from the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment based in Rapid City. They will serve in a public affairs capacity in the joint information command center.
The mobilization is under the command of the D.C. National Guard and is federally funded, Rhoden said. The initial deployment is expected to last for 30 days.
Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district on Aug. 11, even though violent crime in the district is at a 30-year low. He mobilized the District of Columbia National Guard, which he is able to do because the district is not a state, to assist local law enforcement. Guard troops from West Virginia, Louisiana, Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina also have sent troops to the nation’s capital.
Free DC, a group that advocates for district self-governance, has called the move dictatorial.
“Trump is laying the groundwork to quell all public dissent to his agenda. If he is successful, it would spell the end of American democracy,” the group said. “We refuse to allow that to happen.”

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Immigration raid at Washington blaze stokes fear in wildfire crews nationwide

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

BLENDON TWP. — A proposed large-scale battery energy storage system in Blendon Township has sparked environmental and health concerns among residents, though a formal application for the project has not yet been submitted.
Township officials are considering a proposal for a battery energy storage system, or BESS, which is designed to store electricity from the power grid and release it during periods of peak demand.
The parcel would be at 8284 88th Ave., located in the township’s northwest corner.
The concept is new to the township and to much of Michigan, which currently has no battery storage facilities in place.
“This is new to us,” said Township Supervisor Greg Golembiewski. “Everyone has more questions than answers right now.”
The company, Key Capture Energy, first approached township officials with the proposal about 18 months ago. Residents’ primary concerns revolve around the risks of fires and potential groundwater contamination from a chemical leak.
Golembiewski confirmed on Wednesday, Aug. 28, that no formal application had been submitted by KCE. The township’s planning commission would need to approve the project once it is formally presented before anything can happen, Golembiewski said.
“There is nothing on the planning commission agenda, and I haven’t heard back from Key Capture about their application. We don’t like to speculate until we see a formal application and there is nothing right now,” he said.
Many residents attended an Aug. 18 public hearing to voice opposition to the facility, highlighting a local dispute now intertwined with a statewide legal challenge over renewable energy development in Michigan. According to meeting minutes, residents expressed fears about fire, water contamination and safety, including:

Fire risks associated with large-scale battery storage facilities.
Water usage, especially in light of current issues with wells drying up in the area.
Lack of clear evacuation plans for neighboring areas in the event of an emergency.

“Residents urged the board to reconsider the ordinance and to take into account the safety, environmental, and governance implications before proceeding,” according to the meeting minutes.
Golembiewski said residents have “valid” concerns, which is why the company held a public hearing about the project in July. At that time, KCE officials were on site to answer questions and address residents’ concerns.
If the project is built, Blendon Township would be the first Michigan location for KCE which owns and operates 14 facilities — 11 in Texas and three in New York — totaling more than 620 megawatts.
 What is BESS?

According to the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan, large-scale battery storage sites are a crucial part of the new renewable energy grid. Because industrial wind turbines and solar fields do not produce a constant supply of power, BESS facilities store electricity for when it is needed most.
The BESS sites, which look like rows of shipping containers filled with lithium-ion batteries, can draw surplus energy from the power grid. They then sell this stored electricity back to utility companies at a higher price during periods of high demand, helping to balance the grid and prevent shortages.
The proposed Blendon Township site is a 12-acre site at 8284 88th Ave., where KCE hopes to put a four-hour, 100-megawatt battery storage facility.
Company officials have said they chose the location because it has the capacity to house standalone battery storage. The property is also close to the existing transmission grid and has an adjacent electric substation, which makes it easier to connect to the existing system.
 Next steps

Blendon Township could consider two paths for permitting the KCE project. If the township approves a Compatible Renewable Energy ordinance, it could receive a State Renewable Ready Communities Grant.
This grant would pay the township $5,000 per megawatt-hour, totaling $500,000 for the KCE facility. The township would receive half of that amount when construction begins and the other half when the project is finished.
However, if the township denies the proposal, KCE can bypass the local approval process and apply directly to the state under Act 233, a law signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in November 2023. In that case, the township would not receive the grant money.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-30-081929-1024x526.png,,,2025-08-31 14:57:20.276145

Heather Honey, a high-profile denier of Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, has been appointed to a senior position in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in which she’ll help oversee the nation’s election infrastructure.
Honey is a protege of Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who tried to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results. In 2024, ProPublica reported that Honey had played a key role in Mitchell’s behind-the-scenes effort to change Georgia’s election rules to allow Republican officials to contest a potential Trump loss in that year’s presidential race. Honey also promoted election conspiracy theories, including one Trump cited in a speech to his followers before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Though states do the on-the-ground work of running elections, DHS supports them with tasks beyond their capacities, such as protecting IT infrastructure and voter databases from foreign intrusions. The agency, with bipartisan support, took on this role in the aftermath of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
Experts on voting and state election officials warned that Honey’s appointment as DHS’ deputy assistant secretary of election integrity could erode trust between state and federal officials, prompting states not to share information with the agency.
“We are witnessing a dangerous trend: the elevation of known bad-faith actors like Heather Honey,” said Adrian Fontes, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, in a statement, citing Honey’s “well-documented history of spreading election lies that have been debunked in court.”
Fontes called her involvement with DHS “deeply troubling” and said “when the agency gives a platform to individuals who have actively worked to erode public trust, it becomes harder to view DHS as a reliable partner in election security.”
A DHS spokesperson did not answer questions from ProPublica on Honey’s appointment or the exact nature of her responsibilities. Honey didn’t respond to calls or emails. The White House also didn’t respond to a request for comment. Her name is listed on the organization’s leadership structure online, and her appointment was first reported by the website Democracy Docket.

In the first Trump administration, the federal government set up programs designed to shield U.S. elections from foreign interference, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, an arm of DHS. But Trump soured on this and other initiatives after the director of CISA publicly rebutted his claims that the 2020 election was stolen.
Since the start of the second Trump presidency, the administration has gutted those programs, cutting hundreds of employees at CISA. Its director, Chris Krebs, is now under federal investigation, DHS has said; Krebs told CNN that the investigation appeared to be an act of political retribution. The Justice Department has also rolled back a program aimed at combatting foreign influence campaigns. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a memorandum that the Justice Department’s program was disbanded to “free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion.”
David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit focused on building trust in American elections, said the cuts had dismantled “nearly all” of DHS’ capacity to protect election infrastructure. He said state elections officials feared that Honey’s appointment, combined with the program cuts, signaled the Trump administration’s intent to eliminate bulwarks of fair U.S. elections.
“The hiring of an election conspiracy theorist with no election knowledge or expertise is the culmination of this reversal,” Becker said. “DHS now appears poised to become a primary amplifier of false election conspiracies pushed by our enemies.”
Two sources familiar with Honey’s hiring at DHS said she began working for the agency last week. An organizational chart dated Aug. 18 on the department’s website identifies her as a leader in the agency’s Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans. Her position wasn’t on a version of the website archived in July, and officials in former administrations said that there’s been no such job previously.
It’s not clear yet what Honey will oversee, but former DHS officials said that deputy assistant secretaries are typically the agency’s top experts in their subject areas. They’re often involved in drafting executive orders and crafting policies. They also serve as liaisons to the White House and the National Security Council.
Since Honey started, Trump has announced “a movement to get rid of” mail-in ballots and voting machines via executive order, though a top aide subsequently said the administration would pursue those goals through legislative action. DHS has also threatened to cut off about $28 million in grants to help states prepare for terrorism and disasters if they don’t change voting rules to conform to the administration’s priorities, NPR has reported.
Honey’s duties likely would include helping to organize the government’s policy responses if foreign actors make intrusions into the nation’s election systems, former officials said. To do this, and to assess the security of election infrastructure, someone in her position would typically have access to classified information, including the government’s election-related intelligence.
Experts expressed concern about Honey’s portfolio, given her history of spreading misinformation.
“Heather Honey’s past misleading claims about vote counts in Pennsylvania, among other things, have helped fuel false conspiracy theories about stolen elections,” said Larry Norden, an election expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, a nonpartisan law and policy group.
Before becoming swept up in the “Stop the Steal” movement, Honey had no experience in the federal government or as an election administrator, working as a Pennsylvania-based private investigator.
After the 2020 election, she became a contractor for a Republican-backed audit seeking proof of fraud in ballots cast in Maricopa County, Arizona. According to emails between employees working on the review, which ended up reaffirming Biden’s win, Honey helped draft the final report.
Since then, Honey has led at least three organizations devoted to transforming election systems in ways championed by conservatives, such as tightening eligibility requirements for people to be on voter rolls. Members of Honey’s Pennsylvania Fair Elections, a state chapter of Mitchell’s nationwide Election Integrity Network, have challenged the eligibility of thousands of residents to be on voter rolls.
Honey has also been involved in numerous other efforts to transform elections around the country, including a successful push to get many states with Republican leadership to pull out of a bipartisan interstate partnership to share data to make voting more secure.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)In 2005, as a reporter embedded with a Missouri National Guard unit in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I witnessed one of the largest disaster relief operations in American history.
On the ground with the men and women of a Missouri Guard military police company, I was far removed from the decisions — and the blunders — that would ultimately mar the massive rescue effort. Instead, I saw firsthand how average Americans coped with the hardships and uncertainty of being thrown into a situation without precedent.
It was dirty and messy, and the outcome was uncertain. I ate MREs with the Guardsmen and chatted about their families and listened to concerns about their Constitutional duties as soldiers.
Now, the National Guard is on the streets of the District of Columbia, with live ammunition, summoned by President Donald Trump to assist in a hastily declared and thinly supported law enforcement mission. Trump is also considering other Democratic stronghold cities for such deployments, including Chicago and New York.
The contrast between the deployments could not be sharper.

Twenty years ago, the National Guard was called up in the thousands for a devastating national disaster. Today, the Guard is in DC on a partisan mission that breaks political norms. If Trump federalizes the Guard and sends it to other cities, it would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a foundational 1878 law meant to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement on American soil.
The storm that struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, was devastating. In addition to winds in excess of 100 mph that turned roofs into sails and toppled walls, Katrina also brought a surge of water that overwhelmed levees and flood walls and submerged 80% of the city. A citywide evacuation had been ordered, but some residents stayed, including many from the poorer sections of the city who didn’t have anywhere else to go. Thirty thousand people spent days in the shelter of last resort, the Louisiana Superdome, without lights or air conditioning, food or water, or functioning restrooms. Misery was widespread across the city, especially in the Lower Ninth Ward, a historically Black section of the city that experienced catastrophic flooding.
The hurricane left 1,800 people dead in New Orleans and across the Gulf coast and displaced more than a million. Katrina was also the costliest storm on record, with damage estimated at $161 billion.
But the Missouri National Guard unit I was embedded with didn’t know any of this on its convoy to New Orleans. When the soldiers of the 1138th Military Police piled into their Humvees and trucks at company headquarters at West Plains, Missouri, they had about as much information (or rather, misinformation) about the situation on the Gulf as did anyone who had been paying attention to the news. They expected out-of-control looting and general lawlessness. But the reports of looting were exaggerated and the most lawless element was among the New Orleans police, who shot 10 civilians, including four fatally.
Katrina showed how crucial federal funding is after a disaster. How much will remain?

Because I was with the Missouri National Guard unit every hour of every day on the convoy south, I knew what they were talking about. There were earnest discussions among the soldiers about what they would do if ordered to fire on American citizens for looting, and the consensus was that they would refuse. What looked like looting to one individual might just be survival. Somebody might be carrying a television to trade for food and water. Above all, they wanted to help people in need, by effecting rescues or bringing much-needed supplies.
Later, as I walked the French Quarter, I noted maroon-bereted 82nd Airborne soldiers on patrol with automatic rifles at hand. This was a disturbing sight in an American city, one that brought to mind third-world countries. But this was no banana republic. This was New Orleans in distress, and some regular Army troops, in addition to National Guard units from all 50 states, had been sent to help.
The National Guard has been deployed on American soil periodically for disaster relief or to assist local authorities with civil unrest. The latter includes the George Floyd protests in 2020, the LA riots of 1992, and at Kent State.
On May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Vietnam war protestors on the Kent State University campus, killing four students. A photograph of one of the dead students, with a girl kneeling and crying out for help behind, shook the soul of America — and won the Pulitzer Prize.
The Ohio Guard had been sent to the campus by Gov. Jim Rhodes, at the request of the Kent mayor, after the ROTC building had been burned to the ground the previous night. The Guard, with bayonets fixed, was attempting to disperse a crowd of 2,000 demonstrators. The students threw rocks, and the soldiers responded with tear gas. Then, in the space of 13 seconds, the Guardsmen fired more than 60 shots at demonstrators.
It is unclear why the soldiers took kneeling positions and opened fire, although one of the survivors said there is audio tape evidence of the command being given. Eight Ohio Guardsmen were acquitted in 1974 after a judge declared, after a two-week trial, that the government had presented insufficient evidence to support the federal indictments.
The National Guard is generally exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act, as it is normally under the control of state governors, but it becomes subject when it is called up under federal service. The District of Columbia is a special case, because the district is under control of Congress and the president is, in effect, the governor of the district.
If Trump were to deploy the Guard elsewhere, there would be a host of legal challenges. But he has already demonstrated his willingness to expand the use of the military on U.S. soil, as his administration has authorized the Guard to be deployed to assist with “alien processing” in 20 states with Republican governors. The states with Democratic governors, including Kansas, would no doubt object.
Katrina alters local health care landscape, though underlying ills still the same

The militarization of immigration and law enforcement is disturbing. Trump is using it to punish jurisdictions that are Democratic strongholds, many of which have significant Black populations, and others that are hotbeds of dissent. His official justifications don’t pass the litmus test of truth. He claimed to deploy the Guard in D.C. to fight crime, despite violent crime there hitting a 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.
Some leaders in Kansas City, Missouri, are worried their city may be next.
“I do think Kansas City should be prepared, because this will probably happen to us,” said Kansas City Democrat Barbara Washington, as reported by the Kansas City Star. “I think the actions of our president have shown that he is not open to equality for people of color.”
While other politicians doubt Trump will take interest in any city in a state as deeply red as Missouri, some worry the high crime rates of Kansas City and St. Louis may be enough of an excuse. Kansas, where 101 out of 105 counties went for Trump in 2024, may be relatively safe. Well, except for the city of Lawrence, which might just be blue enough to attract the president’s dictatorial gaze; it went for Kamala Harris by a margin of more than 2-1.
In D.C., the 2,200 Guard members have spent the past week mulching cherry trees and clearing homeless camps. That would be in keeping with Trump’s obsession with the value of real estate and his disregard for human life. But the true goal of the deployment appears to be a further test of just how much the American public will take before standing up to authoritarianism. Congress and the Supreme Court have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to Trump, so ultimately any change must come from the ballot box.
In the seven months Trump has been in power, he has upended convention and pursued an unchecked appetite for power. The American landscape has been transformed into a terrain fit for a dictator, with ever-expanding executive power, a masked secret cadre of ICE agents pursuing migrants and sometimes citizens, a crackdown on diversity and dissent, and the growing presence of an armed military in our cities.
How long will it be before there’s another 13 seconds in which the National Guard faces off against unarmed protestors and in the chaos leaves one or more “dead on the ground?” This is something Trump may be actually hoping for, because any act of violence serves as an excuse to call out more troops. And more troops means more intimidation, more control, more power.
Trump is building a case for martial law through a series of immigration and law enforcement “emergencies,” but only for those blue cities he’d like to punish or neutralize. Chicago, New York, Baltimore. It would only be a small step from there to declaring an election emergency. He wouldn’t have to cancel or postpone the 2026 midterms. Just the presence of armed troops at polling places to ensure a “fair” election might discourage enough voters to do the trick. He’s already vowed to end mail-in voting, an anti-democracy pledge that would have sunk any other president quicker than you can say Watergate.
Since Katrina, infrastructure shortcomings create resiliency fatigue

I don’t know what the National Guard troops deployed in D.C. are thinking, or what those who might be tasked with “alien processing” feel about it. All I have is my experience with that Missouri National Guard military police company a generation ago. But based on that, I suspect directing the Guard to deprive American citizens of their civil liberties might be more difficult than Trump thinks. Many will remember their oath is to the Constitution, not to any president or ideology.
Recently, the Trump administration placed on leave some 30 Federal Emergency Management Agency employees who signed an open letter warning of a Katrina-level disaster because of agency mismanagement. The Trump-appointed leadership, the letter said, was simply too inexperienced and too partisan to do their jobs.
The letter cited the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which exposed the federal government’s failures to prepare for disasters and deliver aid quickly.
There will never be another Hurricane Katrina.
But that’s only because the World Meteorological Organization retired the name after 2005. There will be other storms, equal to or worse than Katrina, and Trump administration ignores the signatories of the warning letter at our peril.
We find ourself in an age of storms.
To survive the current political hurricane, we must find the courage to stand up to political bullying, be guided by reason but moved by compassion, and be willing to help those among us who are in the most danger of being washed away.
The situation is without precedent.
Never before, not even during Watergate, has a U.S. president engaged in such an authoritarian power grab. If we were faced with one or two crises at a time, then it would be easier to know how to respond. But the entire federal government has been turned inside out and made the political instrument of one man. From the dismantling of the intelligence community to the purging of scientific integrity at public health and disaster response agencies, from the war on migrants to the squelching of dissent on college campuses, and now to the use of the military in law enforcement, the house Abraham Lincoln referred to in his 1858 speech is not just divided, but on fire.
“I want to speak plainly about the moment that we are in, and the actual crisis, not the manufactured one, that we are facing in this city, and as a state, and as a country,” Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said Aug. 25 in Chicago. “If it sounds to you like I am alarmed, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed.”
The odds that either of the Kansas Cities or Lawrence or any other blue dot in a red state will be targeted right now is low, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t respond to Pritzker’s tocsin. It will be dirty and messy, the outcome will be uncertain, and there will be a lot of talk about civil disobedience and our Constitutional obligations as citizens. We are beyond the guardrails of a two-party system and are now facing a party of one with ever-expanding executive power. It’s time for us to talk, at our kitchen tables and taverns and community centers, and decide what orders we’ll follow — and what kind of nation we want.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.













We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics





Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

 In an era when facts are contested and expertise is under siege, it’s worth remembering that data not only informs policy—it can transform lives. 
The post Trump rejects data he doesn’t like. Boston faces troubling facts head-on to craft solutions to problems. appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","READ THE HEADLINES of the past few weeks – and you’ll see a common theme of an administration that rejects data and science that don’t suit their quest to consolidate power.  
Don’t like the jobs report? Fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Want to clamp down on American cities? Ignore the data that says crime in Washington, DC, is down 30 percent and call up the National Guard. Reject climate science. Dismantle the Education Department. Undermine academic research. And last week, force out your own head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only weeks after she took office, apparently over her  unwillingness to reject the CDC’s own science.  
These are far from the only examples, in an administration that has systematically replaced experts, researchers, and data with sycophants, charlatans, and falsehoods. 
Why does this matter? In an era when facts are contested and expertise is under siege, it’s worth remembering that data not only informs policy—it can transform lives. 
In 2008, The Boston Foundation released a groundbreaking report with a stark finding: only 35 percent of Boston Public Schools graduates who enrolled in college were earning a degree within seven years. The implications were clear and deeply troubling. A system that was helping students reach the college door was failing to see them through it to graduation. 
Mayor Tom Menino didn’t look away. He didn’t question the data’s accuracy, attack the researchers, or dismiss the messenger. Instead, he called a meeting. 
Gathering city leaders, educators, philanthropists, and nonprofits at the Boston Foundation’s offices, Menino declared: “We can do better. And we will.”  
From that moment came Success Boston—a citywide initiative that provided coaching, advising, and support to help students persist through college and into careers. Today, nearly two decades later, Success Boston has helped to nearly double the share of Boston Public Schools graduates completing higher education. The lessons are simple: Data reveals the problem, and leadership turns it into progress. 
Data doesn’t solve problems, especially when these problems are as complex and systemic as the challenges that face us in areas like housing, education, and health care. However, it provides us with insights into what is working and what is not. It guides innovative strategies that can make a meaningful difference in tackling those problems. 
When leaders fire the messenger instead of confronting the message, as the president did when firing Erika McEntarfer as the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consequences go far beyond politics. They erode public trust in our institutions. They blur the line between fact and fiction. And most dangerously, they leave us flying blind in moments that demand clear-eyed solutions. 
At The Boston Foundation, we’ve long believed that data is not an obstacle to be overcome—it’s a compass to be followed. It allowed my predecessor, Paul Grogan, whose sometimes rocky relationship with City Hall caused some to think that he would be a political rival to the mayor, to work with Mayor Menino to benefit the children of Boston.  
Success Boston is far from the only example. For more than two decades, the Greater Boston Housing Report Card has used local, state, and federal data to track housing supply and affordability in Greater Boston.  
By examining more granular affordable housing data, Mayor Michelle Wu was able to identify specific buildings with expiring affordability restrictions, map neighborhoods most at risk of displacement, and quantify the gap between existing affordable units and projected need. This evidence base enabled policymakers and funders like The Boston Foundation to prioritize investments, craft targeted preservation strategies, and mobilize community-based organizations to intervene before homes were lost.  
Without this data-driven approach, the effort would have been reactive rather than proactive, missing the window to protect the housing that families depend on. It’s why Boston has emerged as a national leader in so many areas—not because we’ve had all the answers, but because we’ve had the humility to ask hard questions. 
We are now relying on data as we work with partners across Massachusetts to address the numerous harms being inflicted on the state by federal actions. Our work to address food insecurity, for example, in the wake of federal changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is informed by Boston Indicators’ research to identify the communities most at risk and the organizations most in need of additional funds to meet what will be a rising demand for food assistance. 
As citizens, we should expect and demand smart, informed leadership at every level of government. We deserve leadership that listens when the numbers are uncomfortable. Leadership that believes in transparency over theatrics.  Leadership that trusts evidence over agendas. Leadership whose mantra is: “Let’s solve this together,” not “You’re fired.” 
Numbers don’t create change—people do. What Mayor Menino understood, and what we strive to carry forward today, is that data must be paired with courage, collaboration, and community voice. Success Boston didn’t just work because of spreadsheets; it worked because coaches met students where they were, nonprofits stepped up to expand their services, and a city was willing to invest in long-term solutions. 
Boston is not perfect. No city is. But we are at our best when we treat knowledge as a public good, not a political threat. When Donald Trump ignores, denigrates, discards or destroys data that counter his narrow world view, he condemns us all to a future of failed policies and flawed decisions.  
As we in Massachusetts are forced to repair the damage inflicted on us by these policies, we can and should use the available data to make informed choices. If we do that, we can provide the strong leadership this nation will need to get through the coming years.

While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1140192021-1024x7371744799798-1.jpg,,,2025-08-31 10:56:20.925103

(Map courtesy of Quail Forever, made with onX Hunt) Quail Forever has acquired an 80-acre parcel near Centerville that will serve as public land access for hunters and outdoor enthusiasts while also improving conservation in the area and habitat for quail. 
The area is adjacent to wildlife management areas at Rathbun Lake, which is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 
According to a press release from Quail Forever, the new parcel has prairie enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program and a building DNR will use to store habitat management equipment. The property will also allow DNR greater access and ability to use tools like fire management to maintain habitat, according to the release.

The land will also be enrolled in the Iowa Habitat and Access Program, which allows for public hunting and habitat management on the land. 
Hunters harvested 27,500 quail in Iowa in 2024, according to the DNR’s harvest season data. 
Eric Sytsma, Quail Forever’s habitat protection officer, said the property will be “key to continue and expand efforts to improve the growing quail population.” 
Quail Forever, a nonprofit that works with Pheasants Forever, is dedicated to habitat conservation for upland birds. The two groups have more than 750 local chapters nationwide and have been involved in habitat conservation projects on 28.8 million acres. 
This latest parcel was purchased with the organization’s Build a Wildlife Area program, which chapters, partners and participants donate to. 
“We’re very thankful to everyone who has helped grow our Build a Wildlife Area program in the Hawkeye state and across the country to allow us to complete great projects for upland birds and hunting access,” Sytsma said in the press release. 
According to Quail Forever, the program has allowed the organization to purchase and maintain habitat on more than 4,900 acres in Iowa. 
In total, Iowa has about 1 million acres of public land, or 1,576 square miles, according to a fact sheet from Sierra Club Iowa Chapter. In total, the state has 36 million acres of land, a little more than 30 million of which are dedicated to agriculture.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A major decision on construction of the proposed 807-mile trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline is expected by the end of the year. 
Rex Cannon, co-president of pipeline developer 8 Star Alaska, told attendees of the annual Alaska Oil and Gas Association conference that his company intends to finalize gas sales agreements and then make a final investment decision on pipeline construction before the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. 
If the project advances to completion, it would end more than 50 years of false starts, missed goals and dropped promises from a wide variety of developers.
“I’m excited about the gas line because I like an underdog story,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy told conference attendees after standing in the back of the conference hall and watching Cannon’s presentation.
“(We’re) incredibly close. I’m not going to pop the champagne bottle until the contract (is) signed and there is pipe being built and welded.”

Glenfarne, an international energy company, bought 75% of the proposed AKLNG project from the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a state-owned firm, earlier this year. AGDC retains a 25% stake in the project.
Their joint venture is called 8 Star Alaska, referring to the eight stars on the Alaska flag.
Under the pipeline project’s latest plan, it would be built in two phases.
The first phase would involve building the pipeline itself along a route from the North Slope to the western side of Cook Inlet, where it would connect into the existing Anchorage-area gas distribution system.
That effort, planned for completion as soon as 2029, would be for in-state use. 
It would carry gas from either Point Thompson or an under-development oil and gas project near the Dalton Highway to southcentral Alaskans who are facing a shortage.
In February 2024, AGDC estimated that the first phase would cost at least $11 billion to construct.
A Glenfarne spokesperson said after Cannon’s presentation that the first phase could be constructed even if 8-Star doesn’t export gas to international customers.
“Phase 1 is core to solving Alaska’s natural gas crisis because it is both financially viable as an independent part of the project and vital to bringing Alaskan gas to global markets,” they said by email.
Phase 2 would involve the installation of a gas treatment plant on the North Slope, an export terminal on the Kenai Peninsula and compressor stations along the pipeline in order to increase the volume of gas that the pipeline can carry.
That is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars more.
The initial phase of the pipeline wouldn’t need the compressors because in-state demand is so much lower than what would be needed for export, Cannon said. 
That first phase also wouldn’t need the gas treatment plant — designed to strip carbon dioxide from the gas before shipment down the pipeline — because the initial gas sources to be used on the North Slope don’t contain much carbon dioxide.
Because the pipeline wouldn’t be built in time to prevent gas shortages in southcentral, Cannon said 8 Star intends to build a gas import facility at the site of its future export terminal.
The import terminal is one of three currently being planned for Cook Inlet. At a future date, Cannon said, the import terminal could be flipped to flow in the opposite direction and become part of the export facility.

For decades, the biggest obstacle to construction of a trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline has been its cost and the need to finance its construction.
In response to questions on Thursday, Cannon said the company is “working two fronts” when it comes to financing.
On one front, “We are working directly with the Department of Energy with their loan program office, and there’s some opportunities there,” Cannon said. 
On the other front, the company is seeking loans from banks and “institutional investor types to essentially fund a project where all the key contracts are in place.”
That would require 8 Star to sign contracts with utilities — either in Alaska or elsewhere — that are interested in buying gas from its pipeline.
At full capacity, the pipeline would carry 20 million tons of natural gas per year. 
“To date, where we are, is we have signed either letters of intent or essentially cooperation agreements with both PTT out of Thailand and CPC out of Taiwan to supply about 8 million tons of LNG. That leaves about 12 out of the 20 million tons per year capacity. We’re in negotiations right now for well more than those 12. Frankly, it’s going to be kind of a question of who gets there first.”
PTT and CPC are each state-owned oil and gas companies; neither country’s commitment is 100% firm yet.
South Korea and Japan have frequently been mentioned as possible customers for Alaska gas, but to date, neither country has committed. Earlier this week, Nikkei Asia interviewed experts who said they believe the cost of Alaska gas is likely too high for a deal anytime soon.
Cannon, speaking to attendees of the AOGA conference in Anchorage, was bullish on the prospects of a deal and said 8 Star is soliciting bids from companies that might supply the pipe that makes up the pipeline.
“Already, we’ve gone out to 15 different mills and suppliers from around the world, Asia, North America and Europe. We are in the middle of a selection process with prime contractors for pipeline construction,” he said. 
The company doesn’t have the pipeline’s full right of way secured, he said, but the company is “95% there on the right of way. What’s left on the right of way … is really either under negotiation or, I would say, well in hand. … A lot of the engineering has already been done. And of course, the permits are there.”
Cannon didn’t mention the possibility of litigation intended to slow or stop the project; every major oil and gas project in Alaska has faced lawsuits.
At the end of his presentation, Cannon signed a ceremonial agreement with the state and the federal government that involves the pipeline’s route through Denali National Park.
“As I’ve said before, it’s like Christmas every day,” Dunleavy said, referring to a prior comment praising the Trump administration. He then moved on to talking about the pipeline.
“This is just one example of the speed by which they’re moving, and it’s going to be an amazing five months.”

A new study shows that contrary to long-held scientific assumptions, wolves will move den sites to follow migrating prey. (Wyoming Game and Fish)Scientific research has long assumed gray wolves are non-migratory during springtime, staying anchored to tend to litters of nearly helpless pups. For the first weeks of life, after all, pups are blind, deaf and extremely vulnerable.
A game camera image captured in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, however, upends that assumption. In the picture, an adult female wolf hauls a squirmy-looking pup by its hindquarters. The collared female, GPS data shows, was transporting the youngster from a den site to a new pack “rendezvous” site — effectively relocating her young family.
The photograph is part of a study, “Wolves use diverse tactics to track partially migratory prey,” that sheds new light on the evolving dynamics between ungulates and the carnivores that prey on them.

The study, published Aug. 1 in the journal Current Biology, finds that canids with very young pups relocate homesites if their source of prey — in this case, elk — migrate.
The research helps illuminate the ways shifting ungulate migrations can impact predator behaviors and ecosystem dynamics, said senior author Arthur Middleton, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who has spent years researching ungulate migration and conservation in Wyoming.

This map shows major elk migrations of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. (Arthur Middleton)    
 
“It’s sort of become pretty obvious to me that (ungulate migrations are) really important to the functioning of the ecosystem,” Middleton said. “But, we’ve had work to do to show how and why, and so I think this helps add another piece of that puzzle.”
This puzzle piece relates to the ways ungulate movements can directly influence the behavior of large carnivores. “That has broader implications, I think, for how we think about the migrations and why we’re trying to conserve them and things like that,” Middleton said.
  Tracking movements 

The research team set out in 2019 to learn about wolf predation in more granular detail, said co-author Avery Shawler. To do that, researchers partnered with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to put collars on both prey — nearly 100 members of the large Cody elk herd — as well as their predators — 19 wolves belonging to seven packs.
“So we were investigating wolf kill sites to see what they were killing and eating,” said Shawler, who completed her doctorate at the University of California – Berkeley in 2024.
This study area is east of Yellowstone National Park in the Absaroka Mountains, a rugged landscape home to high-alpine meadows, Douglas fir forests, aspen glades and sagebrush steppe.
During summer and winter seasons through 2021, scientists collected a great deal of data on the movement patterns of the animals, Shawler said.
That allowed researchers “to do movement analyses and compare GPS collar information,” she said. Through that, they realized “that different wolf packs have different strategies for tracking the Cody elk herd, which has individuals that migrate and individuals that don’t migrate.”
Wyoming Game and Fish game camera images helped bolster the collar observations.
Ultimate findings demonstrated that gray wolves use diverse movement tactics to track partially migratory elk. Some Yellowstone Ecosystem elk only migrate short distances in the spring, and the wolf packs that tracked them generally stayed in the territory where they first established their dens. Other elk travel longer springtime distances, and the wolf packs that tracked them went to greater lengths to keep close. That includes packs with pups shifting homesites to follow migratory elk to summer range. Sometimes they carried small pups as far as 20 kilometers from their original dens.
Because the highest source of wolf mortality can be attributed to members of other packs killing puppies, moving them is risky, Shawler said.
The relocation of small pups was not a surprise to Game and Fish biologists and other large carnivore specialists, Shawler and Middleton said. Experts have observed that behavior on the ground for years. The finer-scaled detail provided by GPS collars confirmed their observations.

But, Middleton said, these findings counter years of assumptions by the larger body of animal researchers that migratory ungulates can escape predation in spring because wolves are anchored to dens and their largely immobile pups. The study is the first time researchers outside of the Arctic have observed gray wolves shifting their territorial range to be closer to prey during pup-rearing season.
The game camera photo captured it perfectly, Shawler noted. “Once they got that camera trap photo, literally of an adult wolf carrying a pup that was really, really young  … It was like, ‘Oh, they actually are moving the pups, and that’s over some really rugged terrain, over a pretty long distance.’”
  Implications 

Previous work by Middleton illustrated that elk are highly variable and have the means to adapt to changing climate cues.
This study takes that a step further, Shawler said.
“There’s less research on how predators respond to that flexibility, and it would make sense that predators are also able to adapt,” she said. “So it’s just kind of adding to that literature.”
Understanding how wolves adapt to the prey’s behavior can help land managers better conserve both species, Middleton said. The study area, outside of Yellowstone National Park boundaries, encompasses human development like ranches and wilderness. That makes it a candidate for human-wildlife conflict.
Researchers generated a significant body of data, and Shawler is working to publish further work from it.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)Alabama’s state grocery tax is scheduled to drop on Monday as a law passed last spring takes effect.
The state portion of the grocery tax will fall from 3% to 2%, the result of campaigning by both liberal and conservative groups.
“This is great news for the people of Alabama. The latest grocery tax reduction – the second in three years – will make it easier for every Alabamian to make ends meet, especially in this time of persistently high food prices,” said Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise, a civil rights advocacy organization that has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the tax.

HB 386, sponsored by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville and passed during the 2025 legislative session, does not directly impact grocery taxes imposed by city or county governments, though the law allows local governments to cut those taxes if they wish. It forbids local governments from raising them further.
A message was sent to the Alabama Grocers Association seeking comment.
Most states exempt groceries from sales taxes. Alabama for years was one of a handful of states that fully taxed groceries, and had done so since the state first imposed sales taxes in 1939. State and local levies combined could raise the tax as high as 10% in some areas. Critics said the tax fell disproportionately on lower-income earners and added to food insecurity.
A family that spends $600 on groceries each month and paid a total 9% tax will see their tax on the groceries go from $54 a month to $48 a month, or from $648 a year to $576 a year.
Legislators for years resisted cutting the grocery tax, citing the potential impact it could have on the Education Trust Fund budget (ETF), which pays for most public education in the state. The ETF gets most state sales taxes; HB 386 was estimated to reduce revenue in the ETF by $121 million.
But a surplus of money in 2023 led lawmakers to push for a reduction in the grocery tax. HB 479, sponsored by Garrett, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee and enacted in 2023, reduced the state grocery tax from 4%, the standard sales tax rate in the state, to 3%.
The bill opened the door for an additional reduction, but only if revenue in the ETF increased 3.5%. In the fall 2023, budget experts for the state forecasted tax receipts to increase by less than 2%.
Garrett, however, moved to reduce the tax last spring, saying a repeal of an income tax exemption on overtime wages would pay for the cut.
Even after reducing the state portion of the grocery tax bill in half, Alabama Arise is hoping for further reductions to eliminate the tax altogether.
“We continue to support our longstanding proposal to replace grocery tax revenue by capping or ending the state income tax deduction for federal income tax payments,” Hyden said. “Alabama is the only state to allow this full deduction, which overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest households. Closing this skewed loophole would protect funding for public schools and ensure Alabama can afford to end the state sales tax on groceries forever.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Man-walking-through-grocery-aisle-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-31 08:56:34.805558

into the White House and spin around

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office




State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Getty Images)A law requiring parental consent for almost any medical treatment provided to minors went into effect in Idaho in July 2024, and it has been hampering children’s access to care in unintended ways.
One of the affected entities is the Idaho 988 Crisis and Suicide Hotline.
More than 1,500 Idahoans between the ages of 5 and 17 contacted the hotline between when the parental consent law went into effect on July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, according to data provided by the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline.
Some of those young people can’t move forward in their call without a parent giving permission.
Sometimes, a parent or guardian can get on the phone, according to Idaho 988 Director Lee Flinn, “but in most situations, the minor hangs up because they tell us they feel like they can’t do that.”
“We really do want and hope that minors have a parent or two parents that support them, but one of the things that we hear sometimes is that they don’t have a parent they can talk to,” Flinn said.



How you can get help
Call or text 988 to talk to a trained crisis counselor. Phone services are provided in English and Spanish, with translator services available for 250 other languages. Text services are only provided in English. For online messaging, visit suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.
A trained crisis counselor will listen to you, understand how your problem is affecting you, provide support and share resources, if needed.
Crisis Text Line is a texting service for emotional crisis support. To speak with a trained listener, text HELLO to 741741. It is free, available 24/7, and confidential. 			


She emphasized that the hotline still accepts calls from anyone, and encourages people of any age to call, text or chat online if they are in crisis.
Definition of emergency can complicate how Idaho hotline staff handle call from minor
The law, Senate Bill 1329, passed in 2024, requires that a provider receive consent from a parent or legal custodian to perform any “health care service,” which is defined as “for the diagnosis, screening, examination, prevention, treatment, cure, care, or relief of any physical or mental health condition, illness, injury, defect, or disease.”
Providers do not need parental consent if they’ve been given blanket consent by a parent already or the provider “reasonably determines that a medical emergency exists and furnishing the health care service is necessary to prevent death or imminent, irreparable physical injury to the minor child.”
Lee said many of the calls received by hotline staff members are “really serious, they are in crisis,” but the situation doesn’t meet the high bar defined in the law.
The law has also impeded the hotline’s ability to follow-up with young people, which is considered a best practice regardless of the severity of the situation, she said.
“If a teenager tells us they are suicidal but they’re not at imminent risk, meaning they may not have a plan, they may not have access to lethal means, they’re still feeling suicidal and it is best practice … to offer a follow up call the next day within 24 hours,” Flinn said. “And we’re not able to offer that follow up call or support to minors because of this law.”
If there is imminent risk determined, the call will continue and the responder will try to ensure the minor’s safety, she said.
Alexander Copple, who worked at the hotline as a responder as part of a master’s of social work internship between July 2024 and May, 2025, said the law made it difficult to do what he felt was right.
“We can hear a little bit, and then we would basically say, ‘we can’t continue the conversation  unless you have a parent there who can give consent,’ and then we’d have to end the call,” Copple said. “And we have no way of knowing or following up to know if there was any help or support that was received.”
Flinn said young people can call for a variety of reasons, often stemming from a difficulty managing strong emotions related to bullying, their relation with their parents, pressure to succeed, or a breakup.
“A young person’s brain is not fully developed into their 20s, so when a young person is in crisis, it’s important to remember that they can be very impulsive sometimes, so the best support that any of us can provide a young person, early on in the crisis, is best.”
Idaho lawmakers say they intend to try again to clarify the law
The bill sponsors, Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, and Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, were aware of other ways the law was impeding access to care, and Anthon during the 2025 legislative session proposed a bill to clarify language in it, but the bill did not advance in the House.
Ehardt told the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday that she hadn’t heard of the law’s impact on the hotline. 
“The one thing I’ve said from the beginning, is that we wanted to keep an an eye on things pertaining to suicide,” Ehardt said. “… I think that’s worth looking at.”
Anthon’s bill proposed this year would have created a specific exception for the 988 hotline, allowing for services without parental consent if the child is “is accessing the services of the Idaho crisis and suicide hotline or experiencing a mental health crisis and presents an imminent risk of serious injury to self or others.”
The law as it’s written had also caused problems for those providing sexual assault exams on young people under 18. Under the law, a health worker would need to get consent from a parent to do the exam, but in some cases the perpetrator of the assault may be that parent or another family member, Idaho Reports previously reported.
The law also gained national attention when the Washington Post reported on a 13-year-old pregnant girl from McCall who could consent to her baby’s care but not her own. 
The law came up at a recent legislative Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force meeting, during which advocates disagreed as to whether the law, as written, hampered abuse investigations and treatment, the Sun reported.
Before the passage of Senate Bill 1329, teenagers 14 and older could seek contraception or other family planning services outside of abortion, treatment and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and inpatient care for mental health, the Idaho Press reported. Those 16 and older may consent to treatment or rehabilitation for substance abuse.
Children’s advocates at the time of the bill’s passage expressed concern it would have a “chilling effect” on young people’s access to health care, the Idaho Press reported.
Ehard’t seatmate, fellow Idaho Falls Republican Marco Erickson, had originally raised concerns about the impact on crisis and suicide centers when the bill was introduced in 2024. Erickson is a program director at Community Youth in Action, which works toward substance abuse and suicide prevention.
He told the Sun that he had heard the bill had been impacting services at the hotline, and he’s been advocating for those who are affected to bring potential solutions to the bill sponsors.
Erickson did not sponsor the bill, and although he expressed concerns about the mental health aspect of the bill, he voted for it on the floor.
“I’m just, in good faith, hoping they take care of it,” he said. “… (Ehardt) assured me that these issues would be addressed.”
Ehardt has said she believes the law has been “misconstrued” and overly broadly interpreted in a way that doesn’t allow for some basic services to be provided, such as a Band-Aid at school, but said she’s open to trying to clarify it.
The bill last year passed the Senate but never went anywhere in the House. Ehardt said it came too late in the session. She hopes to have a bill ready early in the 2026 session.
“Some of those things are being worked on as we speak,” she said.

But President Trump has indicated he wants to pull back on giving states this type of support. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)For years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleanians made the Federal Emergency Management Agency the butt of their bitter jokes.
Anti-FEMA sentiment was so high in Louisiana that local businesses started selling T-shirts a couple of months after the storm lampooning the federal agency with slogans like “Where’s FEMA?” and “FEMA stands for Federal Employees Missing in Action”.
The sentiment is understandable. Almost a half dozen federal investigations launched in the six months after Hurricane Katrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005 – and turned into the country’s most catastrophic natural disaster – determined FEMA failed in nearly every way to respond to the storm.

“Hurricane Katrina exposed flaws in the structure of FEMA and DHS that are too substantial to mend,” concluded a 2006 U.S. Senate report titled “Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared.”
Yet 20 years after the agency’s feckless Katrina response, some Louisiana leaders find themselves in the awkward position of having to defend FEMA.
President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants the federal government to play less of a role in natural disaster response, raising concerns that state and local governments might need to cover more of their recovery costs.
Such a change would likely affect Louisiana more than almost every other state in the country.
Since Katrina, Louisiana has received more public and individual assistance from FEMA ($12.6 billion) than all states but Florida ($16.6 billion) and New York ($19.4 billion), according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which tracks federal disaster spending.
The money helped Louisiana respond to 25 extreme weather events, including 11 hurricanes, six floods and one ice storm, over the past two decades.
That FEMA figure doesn’t account for all of the money Louisiana has received in the wake of Katrina. There was another $11 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went to the Road Home program to rebuild housing. All told, the federal government put an unprecedented $76 billion toward Louisiana’s recovery from the 2005 storm.
Louisiana simply wouldn’t be able to handle the financial burden of major disaster response without significant support from the federal government, according to several former state officials interviewed. Storms with far less impact than Katrina have the ability to overwhelm the state’s assets, they said.
If Louisiana has to worry about covering more disaster recovery costs, the state will have less money to spend on schools, universities, roads, bridges and economic development.
“If we didn’t have the federal money, we would be in a terrible mess, and we would have been in a terrible mess from Katrina going forward,” said Jay Dardenne, Louisiana’s former lieutenant governor and state budget chief for former Gov. John Bel Edwards.

Uncertainty at FEMA
To what extent Trump will pull back on federal disaster assistance isn’t clear.
As recently as June, the president said he would push to eliminate FEMA altogether. He then backed off that rhetoric after July 4th weekend flooding in Texas killed at least 136 people, including children attending a sleepaway camp. His administration’s response was directly criticized.
Still, the Trump administration has already made several preliminary changes to FEMA that alarm emergency response experts. The agency has reduced staff and some of those who remain have been asked to help with hiring immigration enforcement agents instead of working on disaster relief.
The FEMA cuts come on top of those to the National Hurricane Center and other federal programs that provide crucial information to hurricane-prone states and help them ready for incoming storms.
Some reforms Congress enacted in the year after Katrina to strengthen FEMA have also been ignored. A law requiring FEMA’s director to have experience in emergency response and disaster recovery isn’t being followed. Trump’s acting FEMA administrator David Richardson previously oversaw counter terrorism programs but does not have natural disaster management experience.
There are also concerns about whether a new policy delayed assistance during the Texas flood, similar to what unfolded in the aftermath of Katrina.
Due to a bureaucratic breakdown 20 years ago, FEMA failed to promptly provide boats for search-and-rescue teams in New Orleans, even after federal officials knew flooding was widespread, according to a U.S. Senate report from 2006.
This past July, several questions were raised about whether search-and-rescue teams were delayed during the Texas flood because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem now requires every FEMA contract over $100,000 to be approved personally by her,  the Associated Press reported. The Trump administration has denied those allegations.

The ability of Louisiana and other states to respond to catastrophic weather with their own staff would also likely be impacted if Trump changes the traditional funding reimbursements for recovery efforts.
“The federal government will have a lasting role in responding to and funding the impact of disasters; local and state governments simply do not have the resources to do so,” said Paul Rainwater, who was executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority that managed federal funding for state rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina. He went on to serve as former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s chief of staff and budget czar.
“The question the Trump administration faces, given some of its comments about FEMA, is: When will a White House step in and help?” he said.
Presidential discretion
The president has a significant say in when FEMA provides funding to states after natural disasters, as well as how much money states or local governments receive.
When a state is overwhelmed by a catastrophic event, a governor makes a formal request of the president for federal assistance. FEMA starts to provide help to the state authorities after it is granted.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has denied disaster relief that was expected to be approved. His decisions have affected liberal-leaning states such as Maryland and Washington and more conservative ones like West Virginia.
He even stalled for a month on accepting a disaster declaration from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who personally knows Trump and served as his press secretary during his first term as president.
As president, Trump has the ability to not only approve federal assistance, but to also increase the share of the state or local costs that FEMA will reimburse. For example, federal law gives presidents the discretion to reduce or waive the requirement for a state or local government to cover 25% of the cost of debris removal after a storm.
Louisiana has benefited from a reduction of these local financial responsibilities for nine weather events in the past 25 years, including for hurricanes Ida (2021), Laura (2020), Ike (2008), Gustav (2008), Rita (2005), Katrina (2005) and Ivan (2004). The 2016 Baton Rouge-area floods and a severe ice storm in 2001 were also approved for enhanced federal assistance, according to a 2023 Congressional report.
But all the upheaval should be a signal to local and state officials to prepare as if that extra FEMA help might not be coming their way, former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, who worked for President Joe Biden, said in a call with reporters this week.
“There are, right now, a lot of questions about whether any of those costs are going to be eligible for reimbursement,” Criswell said. “You need to put plans in place to make sure that you can do it, regardless of whether you get federal support.”
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he personally advocated for the federal government to cover more disaster recovery bills after Hurricane Laura, which hit Southwest Louisiana, and the 2016 flooding.
Sometimes a disaster is so profound that local governments have a hard time coming up with the tax revenue to cover their share of the recovery. If people lose their homes and are displaced, as happened after Katrina, cities and parishes won’t have much money to put toward cleanup, Cassidy said.
“When you destroy a community, you destroy their ability to raise tax money,” he said in an interview.
Jindal, who served as Louisiana’s governor from 2008-16 and was a congressman during Hurricane Katrina, said he thinks the federal government will always be an important partner in major disasters. But states and local governments should take on more responsibility for smaller events.
“There are many day-to-day disasters that many state and local governments can handle themselves,” Jindal said. “For the bigger disasters that can overwhelm, you still want to have some federal role.”
It’s also crucial that local and state officials know what to expect from the federal government so they can be prepared, said Jindal, who was governor when hurricanes Gustav and Ike hit Louisiana.
“I think it’s important to have clear rules ahead of time,” he said.

Landry: Louisiana shouldn’t worry about FEMA
Trump may have denied disaster relief to other states, but Gov. Jeff Landry said Louisiana has nothing to worry about when it comes to FEMA because of his good relationship with the administration.
“I think it’s all just a bunch of media hype trying to scare people. We’re ready for hurricane season,” the governor told reporters this week.
Landry has a close relationship with Noem and said Trump’s homeland security leader has already responded to requests for assistance for matters in Lake Charles and Terrebonne Parish this year.
“What Kristi Noem has done lately, I mean, we just call her, and we say, ‘These are projects that need to be moved,’” Landry said.
Louisiana is one of only a few states that has a local representative on Trump’s FEMA review council, which is supposed to make recommendations on reforming the agency this fall.
One of the council’s 12 members, who include Noem and Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is Louisiana native Mark Cooper, Jindal’s former head of emergency management and former Gov. Edwards’ chief of staff.
“Obviously, Louisiana is playing a big role in this reimagining for FEMA,” Cooper said this week in an interview from Oklahoma where the review council was meeting. “We’re being heard. Louisiana is being heard as part of this process.”
Cooper said the council already met directly with Louisiana emergency response officials in the Landry administration. It held its second public meeting in New Orleans in July at his suggestion.
The council has made no decisions about whether FEMA’s reimbursement policies for state and local governments should change, Cooper said, but he suggested more might be asked of states.
“We need to do more to help states to be more self-reliant and resilient,” he said.

But when will they send more help?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/31/labor-day-health-coverage-workers/,"Column: If politicians continue to refuse to expand Medicaid, the number of Mississippians with no health insurance will rise in the coming years.","‘Tis the season — Labor Day weekend — when state politicians will trip over each other to praise Mississippi workers.
And they rightfully should sing the praises of the state’s workforce — the entire workforce, those at the top of the pay scale and those at the bottom. Mississippi has a lot of dedicated workers.
But it also tis the season when various organizations evaluate the working conditions of each state.
According to Oxfam, a nonprofit that promotes equality, Mississippi is 51st (including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico) in its most recent ranking of best states to work. The ranking that was released last week is determined based on 27 factors related to wages, worker protection and the right to organize.
Mississippi’s low ranking can be attributed to a number of factors, such as being among the 20 states that have not increased the minimum wage, the lack of paid family leave, low unemployment benefits and a weak equal pay law.
Another factor that is harmful to thousands of Mississippi workers is the refusal of state leaders to take steps to ensure they have adequate health care. Mississippi is one of 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid, as is allowed under federal law, to provide health insurance coverage for the working poor.
Mississippi politicians often have said that instead of expanding Medicaid, they wanted to ensure good jobs that offer health insurance as a benefit.
How is that plan working out for Mississippi workers?
Medicaid expansion has been available for states to opt into for more than a decade. When Medicaid expansion started, Mississippi had one of the nation’s lowest percentage of workers receiving health insurance coverage through their employer.
Guess what?
Mississippi is still near the bottom in terms of the percentage of its workforce with employer-provided health insurance. According to 2023 data compiled by KFF, which conducts health research, just 42.7% of Mississippi workers have employer-based health insurance compared to the national average of 48.6%.
KFF research also reveals that 10.5% of Mississippians have no health insurance at all, compared to the national average of 7.9%.
If political leaders continue to refuse to expand Medicaid and anticipated federal changes play out, the number of Mississippians with no health insurance is expected to rise in the coming years.
Enhanced federal subsidies provided during the Joe Biden administration for health insurance purchased on the federal marketplace exchange are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Congress opted not to continue the enhanced subsidies as part of President Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Without the enhanced subsidies, KFF estimates the average cost of a policy for the 338,000 Mississippians who have insurance through the marketplace exchange will increase $480 per year, which could be cost prohibitive for someone working in a convenience store or waiting tables or cutting grass.
Experts predict fewer people — fewer Mississippi workers — will have health insurance in the coming years because of the federal action to allow the enhanced subsidies to expire and the state’s inaction of not expanding Medicaid.
Roy Mitchell, executive director of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, said federal studies estimate 170,000 Mississippians will not be able to continue their marketplace plan once the enhanced federal subsidies expire at the end of 2025.
That could result in more sick Mississippians, meaning fewer people in the workforce for state politicians to praise.
Yes, ’tis the season to celebrate Mississippi workers.
But when is the season to provide real health care relief for Mississippi’s low wage workers?

Windsor Superior Court Judge H. Dickson Corbett issued a ruling this month preventing the Village of Woodstock from hiring a new police chief. 
In his Aug. 7 ruling, Corbett signaled that the court likely will ultimately rule in favor of the former police chief, Joe Swanson, in his $5 million civil lawsuit against the village.  
Swanson sued the village in early May after the municipal manager, Eric Duffy, and the Board of Village Trustees demoted Swanson from police chief to police officer. At the heart of his lawsuit, Swanson claimed that village trustees did not follow state law, by establishing proper cause, when they removed him from office. 
When Swanson filed the suit, he also asked the court to step in and offer a preliminary injunction, an intervention that would stop the village from hiring a new chief pending future court orders. 
To grant Swanson’s request to step in, the court needed evidence that Woodstock’s hiring of a new police chief would cause Swanson irreparable harm — and Corbett reasoned the case met that threshold. Chris O’Keefe has been serving as interim chief and can remain in that post, according to the decision.
In his reasoning, Corbett signaled that the court will likely rule in Swanson’s favor down the line. 
“It appears that the village trustees failed to apply the correct legal standard before removing petitioner (Swanson) from the office of police chief,” Corbett wrote in the injunction ruling. 
While the injunction did not decide the merits or final outcome of the case, it did offer a prediction based on the court’s review of evidence submitted with the request for injunction, Corbett wrote.
“It appears from that review that the decision of the trustees will be reversed because the trustees did not apply the correct legal standard when making their decision,” he wrote. 
Linda Fraas, Swanson’s attorney, said the ruling was a “very promising sign.” 
The saga started in October after Swanson’s husband got into a verbal altercation with another driver during a traffic incident while Swanson was a passenger in the car. A citizen complaint was filed against Swanson regarding the incident. 
Two separate investigations following the incident found that Swanson did not commit wrongdoing. One of those investigations was conducted by the Vermont State Police and the other was by the Vermont Criminal Justice Council, according to court documents.  
Despite the results of those investigations, Duffy hired a private investigator to interview police department employees about Swanson’s conduct, said Jeffrey Kahn, vice chair of the Board of Village Trustees. Duffy declined to comment on the case. 
After those interviews, Duffy decided to demote Swanson to police officer. Then, the trustees had a quasi judicial hearing to decide if they would support that decision. The hearing, made public per Swanson’s request, went on for more than 14 hours. 
During that hearing, “there was a preponderance of testimony by both police officers as well as dispatchers that it became clear that the chief did not have support within either department,” Khan said. 
Without that support, the trustees reasoned it was best for the community to remove Swanson as chief, Khan said. 
“The trustees’ interest throughout this has been what’s in the best interest of the municipality,” he said. 
Vermont law offers certain tenure protections to police chiefs — and the village has to meet certain criteria to remove them from office, Corbett wrote. In line with past interpretations of the law, the village would have to prove Swanson was “negligent or derelict” in his duties, engaged in “conduct unbecoming an officer” or was otherwise unable to perform his job, Corbett wrote. 
The trustees reasoned they didn’t need to meet that criteria because they weren’t firing Swanson altogether, they were merely demoting him. 
But chiefs hold a distinct rank, Corbett wrote, and removing anyone from that position requires that the village meet the legal criteria. 
“It validates what we’ve been saying all along, that this process was not correct,” said Fraas, Swanson’s attorney. 
Despite the court’s injunction, and the village’s subsequent inability to hire a new chief, the department is running smoothly with O’Keefe in the interim job, Khan said.
Corbett wrote that from his review of evidence submitted with the injunction, the case will likely be passed back down to the board of trustees. At that point, trustees would decide whether to remove Swanson as chief, within the bounds of state law.

The decision came as both towns are negotiating contracts with their individual police unions and after months of slow-moving police governance meetings between members of the towns' respective selectboards.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on Aug. 28, 2025.
Hinesburg will be ending its shared police agreement with Richmond on Sept. 8.
Although the towns have not ruled out the possibility of working together on policing in the future, the current breakdown reveals just how complicated it may be for communities to move toward regional systems for services.
The decision by the Hinesburg Selectboard on Aug. 20 to end the inter-municipal contracts for shared policing services and a shared chief came as both towns are negotiating contracts with their individual police unions and after months of slow-moving police governance meetings between members of the selectboards from each town.
According to Hinesburg Town Manager Todd Odit, the catalyst for ending the agreements was two-fold.
Back in the spring, Odit was approached by Hinesburg police officers about receiving reciprocal coverage from Richmond. At that time, Hinesburg was responsible for covering police services in Richmond whenever the Richmond officer was off duty or unavailable. Although both departments were understaffed, Richmond was not responsible for providing services in Hinesburg.
While the towns last week came to an agreement for reciprocal coverage — since July 1 the Richmond officer has been providing policing services in Hinesburg when there are no officers from the Hinesburg department — the Richmond selectboard agreed to start paying its only officer, Matthew Cohen, time-and-a-half when providing those services.
Although Hinesburg has been paying its officers a $500 monthly stipend for covering Richmond, the increase to Cohen’s pay when working in Hinesburg may have created new inequity between the two towns.
The issues with moving forward with shared policing go beyond the potential for pay inequities, however, not least of which is that the towns have been unable to land on what kind of system they want.
The police governance committee first convened in April after the contract for shared chief services fell apart with the departure of the former Hinesburg police chief, Anthony Cambridge. Cambridge resigned as chief in January, seeking employment with Richmond, which effectively ended the agreement — Richmond opted not to hire Cambridge, who has since found employment as a police chief in Wolf Point, Montana, according to the Northern Plains Independent.
The initial goal of the committee, which has met every other week, was to hammer out a new policing contract for the foreseeable future, but also to discuss long-term planning for how the departments may function in the years to come, including the possibility of a unified police district, a separate municipal entity that would receive oversight from members of both towns similar to how a school district operates.
“If we can get to an inter-municipal district at some point, that would be great, and yes, that certainly would have to go to the voters,” Mike Loner, selectboard member from Hinesburg, said at the governance meeting on Monday August 25. “But we keep having this conversation every time we come together, and we’re just spinning our wheels.”
Over the last few months, the committee has been focused on finding an interim shared chief who could help guide the process, whether the goal was a unified district, continued reciprocity, or the folding of one department into the other. It is unclear whether any viable candidates were ever brought forward.
Even without a shared chief or a long-term goal, in the back-and-forth conversations over the current contract and a future system, union negotiations were one of the largest sticking points.
“I think in reality, one town providing police coverage to another town isn’t going to be possible until both towns get through their collective bargaining process,” Odit said at the recent governance meeting.
While both towns are in contract negotiations, they’re starting from different places. Hinesburg only recently unionized and entered bargaining; Richmond is renegotiating its last union contract. Cohen was able to leverage that current contract to start receiving time and a half in Hinesburg — it contains a clause for extra pay for “contracted work.”
However, in negotiations, Hinesburg officers do not currently have that power.
“With the discrepancies between the two unions on pay, I don’t know where we can go into short term unless we solve that somehow,” Josh Arneson, the town manager in Richmond, said.
In part, the concern is that the negotiations will move out of sync with each other. The towns could end up with contracts that maintain or worsen current inequities between the departments, making it more difficult should the departments ever consolidate.
“One of the things we’re dealing with now is that the employees currently know where they work, what they’re doing, what the rules are, anything other than that is an unknown. And you know, most people don’t like unknowns” Odit said, suggesting that, should the towns decide on a long-term goal, each town might have to outline the process in their collective bargaining agreements.
Unless both unions agree to a certain amount of information sharing between the officers and the towns in the bargaining process, the differences will likely continue, and the roadblocks may remain.
For now, the governance committee has suspended meetings until the towns themselves decide whether a unified district is the goal.

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published by the Valley News on Aug. 28.
LEBANON, N.H. — Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center has begun another multimillion-dollar expansion of its five-story patient pavilion.
The expansion is set to double the 64 beds currently in use in that section of the hospital, Tom Manion, the medical center’s chief operating officer, said in a Thursday video interview.

There are currently 460 inpatient beds in the medical center, according to Dartmouth Health spokesperson Cassidy Smith.
“We do have patients that we’re not able to serve because we’re at capacity,” Manion said.
Following the 240,000-square-foot pavilion’s opening in 2023, this expansion, which began in April, is set to be carried out over yearslong phases on two currently empty floors of the building.
After the final phase of the project, which is planned for 2028, the medical center will be able to admit an additional 4,500 inpatients annually, Manion said. Compared to current rates, this would be an increase of around 12% to 14%, Smith wrote in an email Thursday.
With an aging New Hampshire population, currently the second-oldest state in the nation, the departments set to expand are those that older adults need most: cardiovascular, neurology, oncology, transplant, surgery and general medicine.

Of the 64 new beds, 32 will expand the cardiovascular department, David Duncan, the vice president of facilities management for Dartmouth Health, said on Thursday’s call.
The cardiovascular expansion “is directly related to the age and population,” Duncan said. “As people get older, there’s more heart issues.”
The 32 other new beds will be a combination of neurology and general medicine beds, Duncan said. The particular department of the beds isn’t set in stone, as they can change based on the current needs of the population.
The expansion will also place related departments beside one another, so patients and staff can easily respond to changing needs. For example, the intensive care unit will be relocated to the third floor beside the specialty care unit, which is one step down in severity from intensive care, allowing for movement based on patients’ needs, Manion said.
Locating related units neighboring each other also allows for more “collaborative care” between different levels of physicians and nurses, according to Manion.
Despite health care workforce shortages, medical center officials “feel pretty comfortable in general about the direction we’re heading,” Manion wrote in a Wednesday email. “We have offers made, we have staff coming, etc. But we have some more recruiting to do.”

On a national stage, North Carolina often serves as a state to watch for its purple and swingy political nature. However, its own citizens are opting out of civic engagement at higher rates than most of the country, according to the 2024 Civic Health Index. Ineffective civics education could be part of the problem.
Independence High School junior April Alonso knows this firsthand. She struck out the first time she tried getting her fellow students at the Charlotte school to pre-register to vote.
For her AP Government & Politics class, Alonso had to do a service project. So, she enlisted a group of friends to walk around the cafeteria at lunchtime and get 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register.
They could not have been less interested, she said.
“They seemed pretty uncertain,” Alonso said. “It kind of felt like, if I were to make them register to vote, they would go down a drain or something. Like they acted like it was some kind of punishment.”
The second time around, Alonso sweetened the deal. Anyone who pre-registered would get a few pieces of candy. Suddenly, she had buy-in.
Brandon Rivers has also encountered his fair share of seemingly apathetic students in his time as executive director of the Charlotte Democracy Center, a nonpartisan organization focusing on voter education, specifically in marginalized communities.
Rivers spends a lot of time giving classroom presentations on voting before offering pre-registration to students.
Sometimes, students tell him they’re not interested. Rivers isn’t deterred; he asks them what they care about. Making money? Well, the state government sets tax policy and minimum wage, so they might want to pay attention to that. A safe neighborhood? The city council decides how much to pay local police officers and firefighters, as well as how much to budget for street lighting, so they may be interested in voting in that election.
Bridging the connection between students’ interests and government policy is key to getting them motivated to vote, Rivers said. Making the lesson interesting is also imperative; he’s competing with students’ phones and friends for attention.
Right now, the distractions and disconnect may be winning. According to the 2024 Civic Health Index, North Carolina lags behind most of the country on several key markers of civic engagement.
Turnout in the 2022 midterm elections and voter registration fell short of the national average. North Carolinians regularly discussed political and social issues with friends, families and neighbors less often than in most states. In several areas — participation in public meetings, contacting public officials and frequent consumption of political news — the state placed in the bottom 10 in the nation.
While there could be a host of reasons for North Carolina’s relative disengagement, one factor is at the center of it all: civic education, or the lack thereof.
Civic education teaches students how their government works, and their place in it. If done well, it arms them with the knowledge, confidence and motivation to participate in their local communities, and demonstrates the influence they can have in governmental decision making.
But too often, civic education is pushed to the side to make way for other priorities, and what instruction remains may be watered down to avoid conflict.
This article is the first in Civics Unlearned, a three-part investigative series from Carolina Public Press that explores how, and to what extent, a deprioritization of formal civic education has led to a generation of disengaged and polarized North Carolinians.
This article discusses the problem — civic engagement is relatively low in North Carolina, particularly among youth, and formal civic education doesn’t appear to be doing its part to bolster participation. As a result, public policy only represents a portion of the populace, and a generation of North Carolinians are growing up unprepared to work with each other and their government to solve community problems.
The second article explores how conflicting priorities and inconsistent delivery have hamstrung quality civic education. The final article suggests ways to bolster civic education and engagement, both within and beyond the formal education system.
‘It’s really just the Wild West’

In 1997, North Carolina public leaders sensed a looming crisis. They worried that North Carolina’s civic education was inadequate, and would lead to a generation of citizens unprepared to lead their communities.
So they worked with the North Carolina Civic Education Consortium, within the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s School of Government, to develop a report on the state’s civic health.
The report, published in 2003, centered around a phone survey of 800 teens and 800 adults, found that household income was the best predictor of civic engagement. Wealthier adults and students from high-income families were more likely to have worked with others to solve a community issue, discussed political issues at home, contacted public officials and showed interest in voting, among other civic activities.
Two decades later, these patterns persist. White North Carolinians report greater engagement than their Black counterparts in every indicator of civic health besides participation in public meetings. College-educated citizens also surged ahead of citizens with less formal education, and North Carolinians 30 and older reported significantly higher involvement than younger generations.
Education in civics should level the playing field, in theory. But, it isn’t.
North Carolina’s civic education is inconsistently taught, said Burke Middle College civics and personal finance teacher Timothy Barnsback.
“It’s really just the Wild West,” he said. “You have either great civics teachers or not-great civics teachers, and there’s not a whole lot of middle ground. It takes being passionate about it to actually make it a really meaningful course for students.”
Barnsback has been teaching social studies since 2000. He started with middle school, where the curriculum was more about rote knowledge and less about active civic engagement. But now that he teaches high school seniors, he makes an effort to make his instruction more interactive and student-focused.
He doesn’t have to do that. North Carolina’s standards are very flexible — it comes down to how much each individual teacher is willing to invest in their students. Not every teacher has the desire or resources to do so.
There’s some truth to the stereotype that coaches with minimal background in the subect matter are often also assigned the social studies class, Barnsback said. In his years of helping create professional development resources for social studies teachers, he’s noticed a trend of male teachers not specifically trained to teach social studies who bounce between history and civics on the one hand and physical education on the other, depending on where they can get a coaching job.
To exacerbate matters, the state does not designate funding for civic education or service-learning projects, according to an open records request.
While a $120,000 character education budget exists, professional development competes with various other priorities for the relatively small pool of money.
In practice, professional development is “do it yourself and handle it at the local level,” Barnsback said.
“So there’s not a depth of knowledge, and to be honest, there’s not a real investment in teaching it properly,” he added.
Vague state standards
When Rockingham Early College High School social studies teacher Valencia Abbott gets to the lesson about the roles, powers and functions of different types of local governments, she conducts a special assignment called, “Who represents me?”
She divides her students into groups based on their addresses, and has them search for their mayor, town council and other local representatives. Then, she shows them how they can contact these officials if they ever want to bring up an issue or offer their input.

Regardless of whether her students stay in Rockingham County, the lesson will stick with them, Abbott said.
“These are the things that we do in our system that we have, and they know the steps, and then they’ll be less hesitant next time with that,” she said.
While Abbott chooses to connect the standard to real-life civic engagement, she could just as easily present a Powerpoint on the various levels of local government and call it a day. Teaching is very personal, she said; everyone will approach it differently, and trying to enforce any level of uniformity is likely to be a futile exercise.
“I’m going to do my job to the best of my ability, despite my little paycheck every month, but I also know that there are teachers who come in and do the bare minimum every day,” she said.
That doesn’t mean the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction doesn’t try to develop effective content standards.
In 2021, DPI revised the standards, which serve as a guide for local educational authorities as they develop curriculum for their districts.
While North Carolina’s standards integrate civics into broader social studies instruction beginning in kindergarten, no stand-alone civics course exists until high school.
By second grade, students are supposed to be able to “exemplify ways individuals and groups shape communities and contribute to the making of rules and laws,” according to the state standards. In fourth grade, students should be preparing to be “responsible and informed citizens” by studying the state Constitution and separation of powers.
In eighth grade, North Carolinians delve into the founding documents and ideals of the state and nation, and should be able to “use a range of civic approaches to address problems being investigated.”
If this all seems vague to you, you’re not alone.
After the 2021 standards were released, North Carolina earned a failing grade from the conservative educational think tank Fordham Institute, which found the content, rigor, clarity and organization of the standards lacking. The report pulled no punches.
“Grades three and four target state and local government, but not in a way that is likely to promote understanding.”
“…the civics standards for (fifth) grade provide dubious guidance.”
“Here, again, the standards tease big concepts… but offer nothing concrete.”
“Finally, although the inquiry strand includes a category on ‘taking informed action,’ it is thoroughly uninspiring.”
The STEM-first mentality
When Nicole Clarke, a social studies teacher at Vance County’s Clarke Elementary school, came to the U.S. from Jamaica to teach, she quickly realized social studies played second fiddle to math and reading. There was more small group time and interventions in those prioritized subjects.
Teachers take note of the hierarchy.
“Because it’s not a tested subject, and much focus is not placed on it, then people don’t tend to put their all into it like they would do for literacy and math and science,” Clarke said.
Rowan-Salisbury Middle School social studies teacher Eric Shock has heard the same from his peers teaching younger North Carolinians. They tell him that “the STEM mentality” pushes subjects like social studies to the side.
“Elementary teachers will tell me, ‘Oh, well, we include social studies when we’re doing reading activities and we incorporate it that way,’” Shock said. “ But it’s not direct, purposeful social studies instruction. It is reading instruction with a social studies article.”
As a result, Shock’s eighth-graders often have wildly different starting points when they arrive in his class; some are beginning at zero, while others have been extensively taught and tested on their civic knowledge.
Even when they get there, sometimes the class is not their main concern.
“I’ve had students who have come in and said, ‘Well, I’ve got to get my math grade up because I’ve got the (end-of-grade exam),’ or, ‘I’m not feeling really good in science right now, and, that’s a tested subject,’ and I’ve heard parents say that before too,” Shock said,
He feels like social studies has become a “glorified exploratory class,” in line with music or P.E. Meanwhile, robust civics instruction is as important as ever, he said. It teaches students how to critically think.
“With the rise of social media, my classroom, social studies teachers’ classrooms, we are the front line in the war against misinformation,” Shock said. “We’re the front line in the war against bias.”
Broken civic education
Civic education is broken, and has been for decades, according to a book co-authored by Duke political science professor Sunshine Hillygus.
The goal of civic education is to develop civic-minded adults, but her research found a very small relationship between civic education and voting turnout from the 1950s to the 2000s.
That doesn’t mean civic education is a waste of time, Hillygus said. Rather, it means civics needs an overhaul to meet its full potential.
Too much of civic education is focused on historical facts and figures, memorizing dates and recalling key events, at the expense of more practical knowledge like how to register to vote, cast a ballot and participate in the current political environment, she said.
Schools also need to instill political motivation and perseverance into students who may face an uphill battle their first time navigating the voting system. Studies show that voting is a habit; once someone votes once, they tend to repeat the practice. The opposite is also true; each year someone goes without voting, the less likely they are to start participating.
UNC Charlotte political science professor and researcher Jason Giersch found similarly lackluster connections between civic education and turnout in a 2018 study.
Alongside his co-author, Giersch determined that social studies and civics course requirements didn’t consistently correlate with higher youth voter registration or turnout.
Giersch wouldn’t read too much into it, he said. The results are likely skewed by the degree of variation in civics instruction across classrooms.
“When you don’t have an exam, if all you have is a list of a curriculum, in the classroom, that could be taught any one of 1,000 different ways,” he said. “So some will be ways that lead towards people being civically active, and some will lead towards students not becoming civically active. And because it’s going in so many different directions, you end up with an insignificant result.”
Sometimes, civics is just plain boring. At least that’s what Alonso hears from her classmates in Mecklenburg County.
Since COVID, people have stopped participating in class discussions, either because they don’t find the subject matter interesting or don’t feel comfortable sharing their opinion. Sometimes, it’s obvious the teacher isn’t passionate about the subject, which leads to bland instruction, but other times, her teachers have tried to make class engaging to no avail, Alonso said.
Kids are distracted by social media, video games and friends. Their attention spans have shortened. And after COVID, they tend to hide away behind their phone or computer screens, she added.
Teachers shy away too, for the most part.
“Most of them are extremely careful with what they say, just because they do not want to offend anyone,” Alonso said. “…The majority of them, I’ll say, are pretty well reserved when it comes to that, and know how to pick out topics where they aren’t as controversial.”
North Carolina student Shrutav Deshpande said none of his teachers want to start a classroom debate; so, instruction is mostly centered on facts and history, with few projects or interactive lessons.
“Sadly, instead of benefiting America, politics has split us in two,” Deshpande said. “Every classroom has members from both sides, and any actual depth into politics could be dangerous.”
The importance of civic education
Civic education begins even before the first day of school.
The way students are raised by their parents and their communities is an early determinant of their eventual civic engagement. For example, if a student’s parents talk about voting, they’re more likely to follow in their footsteps. If there’s no community culture around participating in local politics, it may feel less important.
But formal education plays a significant role, too.
Civic education may be particularly impactful among certain groups who have fewer opportunities to develop civic skills outside of the classroom. Nearly 30% of students learn about civics only or mostly in schools, according to a 2022 report by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.
White rural youth and Black and Latino men are overrepresented in these groups. On the other hand, urban teens tended to receive higher quality civic education, including media literacy lessons, classroom discussions and service learning opportunities.
Civic education builds a student’s concept of the world and their place in society outside of family, said Bryan Proffitt, former high school social studies teacher and vice president of the North Carolina Association of Educators. It is crucial that it doesn’t take shortcuts, he said.
If students are able to pass a civics class by reciting the roles of the three branches of government, they’re probably not going to be prepared to understand what it means to vote, follow a debate or participate in a school board meeting, Proffitt said. The world isn’t “uncomplicated” or “uncontroversial,” he said; effective civic education needs to encompass all of its nuance.
“There is an incredibly consequential political decision that is up in the next election,” he said. “Do we have a set of people who are able to think for themselves, versus a set of people who are just going to believe whatever propaganda someone foists on them?”
But the impact of lagging civic education goes beyond voting and participation, Clarke said. If done properly, it teaches kids to solve problems together, to feel heard and valued and to be informed and respectful adults, she said.
“There are some values that kids need to learn and take with them wherever they go, and if civics is not being taught, then I don’t see how they will make good choices in their everyday life,” Clarke said.
Less civics, more polarization
Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer is worried. While citizens under 45 make up the largest group of registered voters, they turn out to the polls at the lowest rates of all generations, he said.
Older North Carolinians won’t be around forever, and when they’re gone, they’ll leave behind a less engaged electorate to make the decisions.

“How will those decisions be made and who will be making them?” Bitzer asked. “Are they the most extreme voices, or are there folks that are more representative of our society broadly?”
It’s political gospel: the fewer people who show up, the more extreme the outcome. The more extreme outcomes, the more polarized a society will become. The more polarized a society, the less trust people have in the government and each other.
Civic education, while seemingly not working at the moment, is uniquely positioned to alleviate the issue. After all, education is the one space that captures nearly all Americans at some point.
If nothing changes, youth will continue to be underrepresented in the electorate.
“The reason that Social Security is the third rail of politics, rather than education spending, is because old people vote and young people don’t,” Hillygus said.
Civic education doesn’t just teach people how to vote. It is also supposed to raise the next generation of leaders by teaching students how to disagree civilly — something not often represented in today’s contentious political world, youth civic organization GenerationNation executive director Amy Farrell said.
“It’s how to disagree about something and not be horrible to each other; to have conversations about things and to listen to the other side,” she said.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

But she never had a chance to take roll call. Hurricane Katrina and the flooding caused by the failure of the federal levee system devastated the city, shutting down New Orleans schools and scattering students, teachers and their families. Months later, the Orleans Parish School Board fired Dolce and all 7,500 other public school employees, and Dolce never taught again at Colton. The papers she had safeguarded from the hurricane sat among her belongings for the next 20 years, until her husband finally burned them in their backyard this summer.
The firings signaled a drastic shift for public education in the city — and for the educators who made up its workforce. In the months following the storm, the state of Louisiana would take over most of New Orleans’ public school district, rebuilding and reshaping it into what would eventually become the country’s first all-charter school system.
Teachers like Dolce looked on as the schools that had long anchored the city’s neighborhoods, and the identities of the city’s people, changed names and changed hands. The charter system did away with attendance zones, sending children to schools outside of their own neighborhoods. Schools were once under a traditional accountability system overseen by publicly elected school board officials. Now, unelected, nonprofit charter boards made decisions for individual schools.
“They broke us down,” said Dolce, now 73. “Everything. Not just Katrina’s damage to homes and lives, but people’s careers, their idea of how they wanted to plan.”
Those who supported the new system cited the poor pre-Katrina performance of the more than 100 city schools that were subsequently moved under state control, along with the school district’s troubled finances, as reasons for the takeover, or “reform,” as they called it.
In the following years, the reformers pointed to sustained “gains in a wide range of student outcomes,” including better test scores and college entry rates, as signs of their success.
Still, the mass terminations had consequences, veteran educators and community leaders say: for the city’s Black middle class, for its teachers union, and for the classroom experiences of its students. Seasoned educators walked away from their careers in New Orleans, feeling disempowered by the reforms, which effectively dismantled the labor power of teachers in the city. The makeup of the city’s educators became whiter and younger, with programs like Teach for America bringing in teachers with less experience, often fresh out of college.
“It was devastating,” said Beverly Wright, an environmental justice scholar whose uncle was a retired teacher at the time of the storm. “It was destabilizing for the whole community. For New Orleans in particular, it literally lit a match to the middle class of this city. … So much of the wealth that we had came out of working in the public school system.”
Now, two decades after the storm, Verite News spoke with more than a dozen educators to understand how the firings shaped their lives.

Dolce was the department chair for special ed at Colton, where she had worked for three decades. She was the kind of teacher who recognized the needs of her students and worked to fulfill them. She decorated her classroom with abandon, incorporated washboards and clothing lines into lessons about the water cycle, and brought in pomegranates and kiwis for children who’d never tried them before.
She was following in the footsteps of generations of Black teachers in the city. The city’s schools and educators reflected how the city’s Black communities had valued and championed education since the Jim Crow era, said the Rev. Brenda Square, who directed the archives and library at the Amistad Research Center at the time of the storm and who later worked to document city’s shift to charter schools. While some New Orleans schools still bore the names of wealthy 19th century slave owners and segregationists, others were named for Black educators and community leaders who had advocated for schools and students, like Joseph Hardin and Alfred Lawless. 
“We had generations of people who were denied the opportunity to go to school to be educated. It was illegal to teach our ancestors to read and write. So education was our opportunity,” said Square, who is Black.
Teaching also served as a steady middle-class job in a city where such jobs could be hard to come by, with a salary that could help buy a house in Gentilly or New Orleans East and put money back into the local economy. By the 2004-2005 school year, teachers made an average of $38,175, according to The Times-Picayune, or about $63,000 in today’s dollars.
Barbara Shelby, a former school psychologist for the district who now works with Wright at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, said the city’s homegrown, veteran teachers were unique in the way they cared for their students.
“Each school was like a family, and they nurtured the kids for generations,” Shelby said. “It wasn’t just a job. It was a calling. I mean, they put their whole heart and soul, their blood, sweat and tears into it.”
Grace Lomba worked as a teacher at Alfred Lawless for 30 years and a guidance counselor at Frederick Douglass High School for eight. Inspired by her own high school guidance counselor, Lomba said she wanted to pass on her good experiences to the next generation.
“They just felt that they could really talk to me about anything, because they knew that whatever we talked about was private,” Lomba said. “We took our kids under our wings, and they trusted us, we trusted them.”
After the storm, Lomba retired. She missed friends and family who had left the city, she said, but most of all, she missed her students.

One of Lomba’s former students, Valda Ridgley, remembers Lomba being “the best teacher ever.” Ridgley, originally from Chicago but with ancestral roots in Louisiana, attended Alfred Lawless Junior High for the two years she lived in New Orleans, between 1978 and 1980. She was enrolled in Lomba’s 7th grade honors English class. Ridgley said Lomba even took her to Catholic church after Ridgley, a Baptist, said she wanted to go to church with her teacher.
The two have stayed in touch over the decades, supporting each other through illnesses and the deaths of loved ones. Even though it’s been 47 years since Ridgley was in the 7th grade, she said she will always think of Lomba as her English teacher.
“She didn’t talk at you, like, ‘I’m the teacher, you’re the student, you listen.’ She actually talked to us and listened to what we had to say,” Ridgley said. “As the young folks say today, she met us where we were. She didn’t talk to us like we were imbeciles. She talked to us like we had some sense.”

The shared identities between students and teachers before Katrina — being Black and from New Orleans — helped uplift kids and remind them that they were capable, Wright said. “I always knew that I could become a teacher,” Wright said, because she only had Black teachers growing up.
By 2005, over 70% of New Orleans public school teachers were Black. Their organizational power was concentrated in their politically influential union, the United Teachers of New Orleans. UTNO’s collective bargaining agreements with the district allowed teachers to negotiate higher salaries and better benefits. The school district also had a transparent pay scale and protections that allowed teachers to stay in their careers for decades, unlike the relatively short-term placements that later became common through Teach for America.
Not everyone saw that power, and those protections, as a net positive. A common line of criticism by the reformers was that the union protected bad teachers along with the good, limiting student and district progress.
Leslie Jacobs, a former member of both the Orleans Parish School board and the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, is often credited as one of the main architects of the New Orleans education-reform model. After Katrina, she was a hugely influential advocate of charter school expansion, and a critic of the local teachers union.
In an interview, Jacobs told Verite News that before Katrina, teachers were caught in a failed system. Dismantling the collective bargaining agreement, a consequence of the turn to the all-charter system, wasn’t an intentional goal of the movement, Jacobs said, and the new system never prevented teachers from unionizing within charter schools.
“It’s a true statement that I’ve never been a fan of collective bargaining, but I’m not banging on the table speaking against it,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs said well-run schools don’t give teachers cause to unionize, because their grievances can be easily remedied by principals, who have more power under charter schools than traditionally run schools. In recent years, teachers within a handful of charter schools have voted to unionize, despite strong pushback from charter leadership.
Wright, and many educators, see the restructuring, which shifted power away from elected officials, differently.
“They were really talking about Black power, the power over the school board, the power over the city,” Wright said.
Reformers also pointed to the school district’s financial woes and its management problems, along with the low academic outcomes of many of its schools, as indicators that the system needed drastic changes.
And in the years leading up to the storm, the district faced increasing scrutiny, with the FBI opening a branch within the Orleans Parish School Board offices to investigate bribery charges between contractors and school board officials, leading to dozens of indictments and convictions.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Before Katrina, the state’s Recovery School District, established by the legislature in 2003, had already taken over a handful of the city’s underperforming schools, tasking charter operations to run them.
After the storm, with the city’s schools effectively shut down, the state moved rapidly. Despite pushback from the teachers union and New Orleans lawmakers — who pointed out that parents displaced by the storm had no say in the matter — in November 2005, at the urging of Gov. Kathleen Blanco, the legislature passed a measure enabling a state takeover.
The new law broadened the definition of what was considered a failing school, expanding it to include any school with performance scores below state average — but applied that new definition only to Orleans Parish schools. Shortly after, the Recovery School District took over 102 out of 117 city schools. By the end of the same month, New Orleans school board officials said that as a result, they would have to fire and terminate health insurance for 7,500 furloughed workers.
Teachers, like other residents of the city, had scattered across the country when the storm hit. Some remembered received letters from the state informing them of their terminations. Others found out about the dissolution of the school system on the news, watching as officials dismissed thousands of New Orleans educators on television.
“They say terminated, I say fired,” said Linda Pichon, a longtime paraprofessional at Lawrence D. Crocker Elementary.

With the loss of their jobs came the loss of health care and income. Family members who relied on that income and coverage suffered, too.
Jackie Brown-Cockerham was in a Texas hospital when she found out she’d lost her job. She was there with her daughter, who was having stomach pains, but the insurance card that she had wasn’t working because she was no longer recognized as an employee. “OK, so what am I supposed to do for my child?” Brown-Cockerham remembered thinking as her daughter sat waiting for care.
Teachers who stayed saw their coworkers leave the city for good, often finding better-paying jobs in the places where they’d evacuated, west to Texas and east to Atlanta. Still, some educators chose to work for the Recovery School District, taking a test mandated by the district’s superintendent to get rehired.
Yvonne Guice, who had taught pre-K at Crocker before the storm, was one of those who returned in 2006. Now, Guice found herself with 27 preschoolers in one classroom, trying to balance lesson plans with the needs of students who had lived through the storm. When it rained, the children gathered around Guice and cried. They wouldn’t let her turn off the lights during naptime.
“You don’t know what they went through, you don’t know what happened, and so you just took it as it came,” Guice said.
By the fall of 2007, about half of the fired New Orleans teachers had returned to work in Louisiana public schools — in Orleans Parish and elsewhere, according to the Education Research Alliance. By 2013, just 22% of the fired teachers were still teaching in New Orleans, with an attrition rate higher than other districts affected by the hurricane.
Educators said that the leaders of charter school reform had villainized teachers, often laying the blame on them for a lack of resources and the district’s shortcomings.
“The least popular cause in town right now must be the resistance of some teachers and their union to the chartering of public schools,” declared James Gill in a November 2005 column for the Times-Picayune.
“Indeed, there is so little sympathy for teachers who feel hard done-by that they might be well advised to pipe down,” Gill wrote. “After all, some of them must share responsibility for the shortcomings of a system that has long cried out for the kind of radical overhaul now in the offing.” (Gill died in 2024.)
“Every ill that the system was going through was the teachers’ fault,” said Cynthia Jordan, who taught at William O. Rodgers and John A. Shaw elementaries before the storm and later worked for the RSD.
Charter advocates argued that the job security and protections offered to teachers by the union and district didn’t help students. “At a charter, we all have to perform to keep our jobs,” said Sharon Clark, the director and principal of Sophie B. Wright High School in a 2012 report. “If teachers at Wright do not perform, I can free up their future to do something else.”


Let us know what you think...


 

A couple weeks after Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, the New Orleans school board held a meeting in Baton Rouge, where several board members attempted to replace then-superintendent Ora Watson with Bill Roberti, one of the consultants with the New York firm Alvarez and Marsal, which had been brought on to rectify the district’s financial woes before the storm.
The vote was split down racial lines, with the board’s three Black members defeating the effort that day. One of those members, the Rev. Torin Sanders, told the Times-Picayne that the effort, which would’ve demoted Watson, who is Black, in favor of Roberti, who is white, was “clearly” racially motivated. Both he and Watson have suggested state education superintendent Cecil Picard was behind the move. (Picard died in 2007.)
“The state superintendent couldn’t stand me,” Watson said in an interview. “He wanted me out of there because he wanted his plan in.”
The meeting alarmed some of the board’s observers — including a group of principals and their attorney, Willie Zanders, who huddled afterward to talk about what had just happened. That day, the school board also voted to place all district employees on disaster leave. Zanders and the principals began to sense a shift in power.
“So we’re meeting at the coffee shop, and we’re discussing this, and the leaders of the principal group said, ‘We need to consider going to court to stop this,’” Zanders recalled.
Zanders’ and the principals’ challenge evolved into a yearslong court fight on behalf of all 7,500 fired employees — including more than 4,000 teachers, along with paraprofessionals, counselors, bus drivers, and others — over whether their firings had been legal.
In 2012, a district court ruled in favor of the teachers, finding that the school board had wrongly terminated them. An appeals court again sided with the educators, with damages estimated at $1.5 billion, a figure that could have bankrupted the district. The school board appealed the case up to the state’s highest court, which ruled against the teachers, and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear the case in 2015.
“I think this whole charter school transition has avoided putting the microscope on human lives that have been impacted and affected by this drive for change,” Zanders said in an interview, reflecting on the case.
Before the storm, it wasn’t uncommon for teachers to have personal connections with their students. Living in the same neighborhoods, they might have known a student’s aunt or parent before the child came into their classroom — or even to have taught that parent.
“There was a standard you expected of your teacher, and there was a standard your teacher expected of you,” Jordan said. “I lived in the community with my students.”

Educators said that the loss of district schools disrupted the communal and economic fabric of Black neighborhoods, and took power away from citizens living in them.
Now, decisions about how schools are run are determined by charter operators, each run by a private board unimpeded by the democratic process. For formerly unionized teachers, that amounts to less accountability over administrators.
“We have no control over charter schools,” Wright said. “The people on the board, half of us don’t know who they are, but that system has been removed from us, and our children are suffering because of the lack of participation of Black people in the system.”
Last year, OPSB discussed running more direct-run schools when it took over the failing Lafayette Academy, a charter school, to open the public district-run Leah Chase School — the first new traditional school it had opened since the storm. But more recently, the current New Orleans public schools superintendent expressed caution against opening more schools, given the district’s decreasing enrollment numbers and financial difficulties.
Most of the educators Verite News spoke with expressed deep distrust towards charter schools and their leadership hierarchies, even if they returned to work in the new system.
Pichon, a longtime paraprofessional, was first recruited into the job by a principal when she was vice-president of the parent-teachers organization for her children’s school, Thomas Alva Edison Elementary. She spent the next three decades working mostly at Crocker. Pichon was wary of the newcomers, people who hadn’t spent their lives teaching. In the turmoil following the storm, she chose not to return to the classroom.
“Drop of a hat, they’ll let you go,” Pichon said.
The splintered system also made it hard for the United Teachers of New Orleans to reorganize following the storm. Instead of negotiating contracts with one authority, OPSB, they now have to unionize and negotiate under dozens of different charter operators. UTNO’s presence, which once defined the district, is now limited to five unionized schools.
Some educators decided to stay with UTNO, even without a contract, to retain certain union benefits. After the storm, the American Federation of Teachers — the national organization under which UTNO organized — tried to rebuild the union and recruit teachers. Lomba worked with the union to try to get veteran teachers to rejoin the union, but organizing was “a big task, because most of our people were not here,” she said.

Other educators said that without the power of a union backing them during disputes, they were hesitant to go back into the classroom.
Dolce had always tried to advocate for her students and her colleagues, even when it meant pushing back against administrative decisions. After the storm, she heard from other teachers who had returned to the classroom and found that they could now be fired for speaking up.
“I knew I had not gone back for a reason, because I don’t want ‘fired’ to be on my legacy,” Dolce said.
Dolce retired after Katrina, unwilling to go through the hurdles of getting hired by the Recovery School District, though she had planned to keep teaching for several more years. Still, she stayed busy — she tutored, phone-banked for the union and wrote individualized education plans for a friend who was trying to reopen Priestley Junior High, doling out her expertise when asked. She took part in the class-action lawsuit, attending court proceedings.
But she found it hard to let go of Colton. After officials finished renovating the school in 2013, Dolce wanted to see how it had changed, so she contacted administrators with the charter network KIPP, which now runs a school — KIPP Leadership — at the old Colton building. They agreed to let her walk around. As she made her way down the familiar halls, trailed by an employee, Dolce took notice of the upgrades, like touchscreen whiteboards and nicer desks. Finally, Dolce reached her old classroom, where the walls were freshly painted and the teacher’s desk was in a different spot.
She felt a sudden impulse to put her initials somewhere, as if she were one of her own students. Maybe under the ledge of the board, where no one would notice. “But I didn’t do it,” Dolce said. Instead, she turned around and walked away.

White, in response, said Duff while on the college board helped implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs anathema to conservative Republican policy.","Higher education — central to the public profiles of billionaire businessman Tommy Duff and State Auditor Shad White, two Republicans eyeing Mississippi’s governorship in 2027 — has already become a point of division between them.
Duff, in a recent interview, appeared to take a shot at White, saying politicians should focus on the jobs they currently hold, not future ambitions for higher office. White, in response, said Duff, while on the college board, helped implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs anathema to conservative Republican policy.
In Mississippi, issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion and other culture war battles roiling higher education have become a wedge issue in intraparty political spats, a legal fight unfolding in federal court and an ongoing effort to keep college students from leaving the state in droves.
Duff is considering a run for governor and has made higher education a top focus of his recent public appearances. He cites his budget stewardship during his stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board from May 2015 to May 2024. 
White, both through reports issued by his office and his own bully pulpit, has led a high-profile campaign for conservative reform of Mississippi’s higher education system.
Duff has hinted at the broad outlines of what could become a gubernatorial campaign agenda, but he has largely done so without offering specific policy proposals, citing the nearly 27 months remaining until Election Day in 2027. The gubernatorial race, Duff added in an interview with Mississippi Today, should not distract current state leaders interested in running from attending to the demands of their offices.
 “I kind of wish all these people that want to be running that maybe have government jobs and responsibilities ought to tend to the ones they have,” Duff said. He didn’t name White, but the comment appeared to be a shot at him. 
In response to Duff’s statement, White criticized Duff’s track record on the IHL Board.   
“When Tommy Duff was on the board running our universities, he supported the creation of the DEI office at Ole Miss, on his watch the University Medical Center started an ‘LGBTQ Clinic’ which gave puberty blockers to transgender minors, and he voted to require the COVID shot for university employees before they were allowed to come back to work, so I sort of wish he would have done a better job when he was in his government position,” White said. “I’d have less to clean up.”
In a statement, Jordan Russell, a spokesperson for Duff, called White’s statement “blatantly false” but declined to comment further. 
John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL, said the University of Mississippi’s Division of Diversity and Community Engagement was requested by the university and approved by the Board in April 2017
The University of Mississippi Medical Center’s now dissolved “LGBTQ clinic” was created in 2019, and an IHL Board vote was not required for its creation, Sewell said. 
On the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Sewell said the board voted against a systemwide mandate in August of 2021, but was then prompted to change course in response to federal regulations. 
“The next month, President Biden issued an order demanding that federal contractors and subcontractors be vaccinated. To avoid losing federal research dollars, the Board voted in October 2021 that individuals considered federal contractors and subcontractors should comply with the executive order,” Sewell said.  
Neither Duff nor White has formally entered the race for governor, but they have both said they are considering a run. Their experience, along with Mississippi’s specific economic challenges, suggests higher education could play a major role in shaping state politics for years to come.  
Duff focuses on fiscal policies
In what Duff’s advisers characterized as the first political speech of his life earlier this month, he reminded the crowd of his tenure on the IHL Board. 
Duff anchored his comments about his experience on the IHL Board in cost savings – a message that aligns with the Trump administration’s elevation of “government efficiency” as a leading political priority. 
Duff said that he oversaw the hiring of a firm to coordinate health insurance policies across the nine institutions in the IHL system, and that resulted in millions in savings. He also said he helped revamp the interest payments universities were paying on bond projects, resulting in about $100 million in savings.
He appeared at a Mississippi Today event with business leaders about “brain drain” and highlighted the need to keep more Mississippi-educated college students in the state by attracting more private-sector jobs. And in an earlier interview with Mississippi Today, he noted that he and his brother are also major supporters of higher education, having donated about $50 million to Mississippi universities. 
Duff also said he supports adding “civic responsibilities” to curricula at Mississippi universities. That reflects ideological currents sweeping the country, with several Republican-led states enacting laws requiring students to take civics-focused courses — often with an emphasis on Western civilization — while scaling back identity-focused content such as race or gender studies.
“I don’t think that’s taught as much anymore. What it means to be an American, a Mississippian. What does it mean to be a future member of society, a citizen? The importance of voting,” Duff said. “Those type of things need to be added into college curricula. Learning our constitution, that type of stuff that makes you more well-rounded and makes you a better student and adult.” 
White has called for Mississippi to change how it funds higher education by stripping public money from degree programs that don’t align with the state’s labor force needs. White pitched that policy as his own solution to brain drain. The idea is that outmigration could be blunted by increasing funding for degree programs with higher earning potential right after graduating, such as in engineering or business management, according to a 2023 report issued by White’s office. 
White was the earliest and most vocal state leader to come out in favor of banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in schools. 
In a statement, Jacob Walters, a spokesperson for White, said the auditor wants to ensure DEI departments are not recreated again under a different name. White also wants to use the money that previously went to DEI offices to increase campus security. 
Walters also provided other higher education proposals White supports, many of which align with the Trump administration’s push to shape teaching around cultural issues and eliminate  “useless woke programs.”  
“Taxpayer money should not be used to fund Gender Studies programs that feature ‘queer studies’ coursework,” Walters wrote. “This can be found right now at our universities. Instead, taxpayer money should fund degree programs that prepare students for real jobs and don’t saddle them with debt they cannot repay.” 
White wants to require that all universities teach “the scientific reality that there are only two sexes,” Walters wrote. 
He also supports putting a surcharge on out-of-state students who attend Mississippi universities. The revenue would be used to fund a scholarship for any graduate with good grades in a high-need field who agrees to work in Mississippi for the first four years after graduation.
Duff and White are seen as likely candidates for governor in 2027, but Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson is the only notable candidate who has officially announced he’s running. 
Gipson also supports eliminating the ability of Mississippi universities to set goals around “diversity outcomes,” a push that became easier after Trump’s reelection, he told Mississippi Today.  
“Like most Mississippians, I’ve always supported hiring and recruitment based on individual merit and qualifications, so I was glad to see IHL move this direction beginning in November 2024,” Gipson said.
Going forward, Gipson said Mississippi universities must adapt to a declining student population, which some call an “enrollment cliff.” Mississippi can do that by highlighting its “quality of life and college experience and culture that other parts of the country can’t offer,” he added.
Preparing students with skills in data and artificial intelligence – industries already disrupting the American economy – would also be at the top of the two-term agriculture commissioner’s higher education agenda as governor, he said.  
There are just under 80,000 students enrolled at Mississippi’s eight public universities and the University of Mississippi Medical Center, many of whom returned to classes this month. They did so as a legal battle heats up that could fundamentally reshape the composition of student bodies and the dictate which subjects they are taught.
Legal questions loom over DEI
After President Trump made banning DEI programs de rigueur for Republican state legislatures, Mississippi lawmakers introduced legislation for two consecutive legislative sessions. They questioned university officials on their implementation of diversity initiatives and finally succeeded in passing a statewide ban in 2025. 
Last week, a federal judge blocked a Mississippi law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Mississippi public schools from going into effect. 
As Mississippi geared up to shutter DEI from its schools, the Trump administration unleashed a torrent of executive actions aimed at universities. The federal government launched civil rights investigations into elite universities and froze billions in federal research money
The Mississippi ruling prevents officials from enforcing the law. Attorneys for the plaintiffs and the state defendants will now move to discovery, where they collect evidence before a bench trial. 
The litigation could drag on past the 2026 legislative session, forcing Republican lawmakers to keep pushing to enact a policy they had already spent over a year drafting and debating.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29112520/White-Duff-Gipson-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-08-31 06:56:21.789003
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-31 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How easy COVID money whet CT lawmakers’ appetites for more,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/31/ct-earmarks-grants-doug-mccrory/,"Many CT legislators are now able to send millions in grants to constituent groups without oversight, standards or transparency.","A few nonprofits serving constituents of Sen. Doug McCrory of Hartford did extraordinarily well when COVID relief arrived through the federal American Rescue Plan Act. 
Funding for one, the Blue Hills Civic Association, tripled to $1.32 million one year, then quadrupled to $5.62 million the next.
The ARPA money was easy, flowed fast and came with a hard end date. It benefited the constituents of far more lawmakers than McCrory. And it whet the appetite for more.
The FBI is now investigating McCrory’s role in obtaining grants for nonprofits, and it comes during a time when Connecticut lawmakers are enjoying a golden age of grants that come with minimal vetting or transparency.
As the ARPA gusher began to go dry — the last of the money was obligated last year and must be spent by Dec. 31, 2026 — the state legislature’s Democratic majority tapped a new well: Appropriating nearly $60 million over two biennial budget cycles for unrestricted grants to be distributed at their discretion.
Earmarks, an endangered species after the arrival of the Great Recession of 2008 and start of decade-plus fiscal crisis in Connecticut, are flourishing.
The two-year budget adopted in 2023 directed the state Department of Economic and Community Development to disburse $17.9 million over two years from a line item labeled “various grants” — an unheralded new source of earmarks. The new biennial budget adopted in June more than doubled it to nearly $39 million.
“Legislators were very used to, with the ARPA dollars, having the capacity to help out different organizations within their communities,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. “And that’s how this has sort of blown up.”
The unrestricted DECD line item is sending money this year and next to more than 120 recipients, none of whom had to submit applications. The only requirement is to know a lawmaker on good terms with the House and Senate Democratic leaders or their top aides.
“It’s asinine,” said Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, the ranking House Republican on Appropriations. “There’s no vetting.”
Other funding — sometimes blandly labeled as “other expenses,” other times in  accounts with names suggesting a purpose — also is directed by lawmakers to chosen recipients in grants distributed by other agencies. 
Some are noted in budget working documents obtained by The Connecticut Mirror as priorities of “SD” or “HD,” short for Senate Democrats and House Democrats. There is $2.9 million in the state Department of Education budget labeled “Senate earmarks” and $1.7 million for “HD priority earmarks.”
“We are now patronizing public officials’ wants and desires, as opposed to vetting these projects and letting them stand on their own two feet,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
The impulse to earmark, to bring home the bacon, is as old as politics. When Connecticut had divided government — Republican governors held office for 16 years until January 2011, most often with Democratic legislatures — such spending greased the wheels of government.
The earmarks
How does one get an earmark today? That turned out to be an awkward question.
“It is really a process where individual legislators make an ask. I mean, I don’t know how else to put it,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said, “I think there are a lot of different entry points.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was slightly more effusive, acknowledging the answer can depend on who is doing the asking, where the money is going and what are the financial and political needs of a district and its representative.
“What do I look for? Is there an interesting story to be told, something where you sort of are sympathetic to the cause?” Ritter said. “Is it just simply a member that is in a tough district? Is it a member you really like? I mean, there’s different reasons you might give a grant like that out.”
It wasn’t like you could take the ARPA money and just sit on it.House Speaker Matt Ritter
Candelora’s concerns echo those periodically voiced by the Auditors of Public Accounts, a legislative agency overseen by a Democrat and a Republican. In 2001, the focus was grants that flowed through the Office of Policy and Management, not the Department of Economic and Community Development. 
The concerns were that the grants were inequitable, issued at the direction of politicians without vetting or competition, and too rarely were subjected to analysis of their efficacy. 
“We were informed that the Other Expenses grants are issued by OPM without solicitation, but merely upon communication from political leaders,” the auditors wrote at the time. “Final reports and/or State Single Audits regarding the grantees’ use of funds were not always available or pursued. There was no evidence available to suggest that an evaluation of the relative merit of the projects was performed.”
ARPA funds are subject to audits.
Ritter said most of the earmark recipients are long-established organizations with clear missions. Some are municipal agencies. But he acknowledged the FBI investigation has heightened sensitivity about process and accountability.
“As someone who represents Hartford, and reading what I’m reading, I’m the first one to say the mechanisms could be better,” Ritter said. “There needs to be more checks and balances in place. No question about that.”
So far, the FBI investigation appears to be narrow, focused on McCrory and his relationship with a woman who runs a nonprofit and consults for others, and with several nonprofits that have obtained state funding with his support. 
Earlier this month, federal prosecutors issued a subpoena seeking emails, financial records and other information from the DECD regarding McCrory and a dozen non-profits and other entities, including three well-established with a presence in his district: Blue Hills Civic Association, Upper Albany Neighborhood Collaborative and the YMCA of Greater Hartford.
One potential witness, an executive with deep familiarity with Hartford’s nonprofit ecosystem, told CT Mirror that they and others first were interviewed by the FBI in 2023, after the ARPA money began flowing. The person declined to be identified. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to say when the investigation began.
Connecticut state government’s share of ARPA funding was $2.8 billion, spread over five fiscal years. About $119 million went to nonprofits.
“What happened during ARPA was A) we had so much money, but B) it had to be spent. That’s what people forget,” Ritter said. “It wasn’t like you could take the ARPA money and just sit on it. And there was real concern at some point, like, can we actually spend all of this, get it out the door?”

No accounting
There is no precise account of what funding McCrory or any other legislator has helped deliver to grantees, either with state or federal funds. Unlike in Congress, where members publicly list their recommendations for earmarks, the General Assembly maintains no record of individual legislators’ requests for directed spending in their districts.
The U.S. Congress banned earmarks in 2011 then reinstated them with greater accountability in 2022 as “congressionally directed spending” in the Senate and “community project spending” in the House.
“Under the new system,” according to the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan congressional watchdog, “Members must provide information, such as the purpose and recipient of the funding to ensure no conflicts of interest. Another requirement is that GAO get involved in tracking the funds.”
None of that is required by the Connecticut General Assembly.
In the recently adopted budget, the intended recipients of funds from the DECD’s various-grants line are not identified. 
There are no parameters on what that line item is for.Matt Pugliese, deputy commissioner, DECD
But a budget worksheet obtained by CT Mirror lists more than 120 recipients in the two fiscal years, with annual awards ranging from $2,500 for the Iwo Jima Memorial Historical Foundation in New Britain to three grants of $1 million: for parks in Manchester, the Upper Albany neighborhood of Hartford, and to a “Consortium of 3 Faith Based Organizations” for counseling, mentoring and youth violence prevention.
No other details are available.
The unrestricted various-grants line items in the DECD budget are unlike others administered by the agency, which generally has an open application process and statutory or agency standards for when the money can be paid and how it can be used.
With no applications from which to work, the DECD sometimes has to track down the recipients intended by lawmakers for the unrestricted grants. 
“We have to literally track down and figure out what the organization is,” said Matt Pugliese, a deputy commissioner at DECD. “Sometimes you have two organizations with very similar names. We do a little bit of detective work, confirm with the legislature that this is the entity that was intended in the budget.”
The DECD will execute a contract with few requirements. Recipients have until the end of the fiscal year to expend the funds.
“The organizations are supposed to provide a report to us at the end of the fiscal year as to how the funds were spent,” Pugliese said. “But, just to be clear, there are no parameters on what that line item is for. It can be used for operational expenses, could be used for a new program. It could be used for a capital project.”
The contrast with the Community Investment Fund, one of the competitive grants programs administered by DECD, is stark. It was created in 2021 as a compromise struck to overcome Gov. Ned Lamont’s tightfisted approach to borrowing for earmarks sought by lawmakers.
Lamont agreed to $175 million in annual bonding for five years for local capital projects awarded through the Community Investment Fund, which imposed transparency, standards and accountability on a process that was formerly ad hoc, often reflecting the influence of a single lawmaker.
Vetting is by DECD staff, which looks for broader community support and local financial contribution. Approval comes in a public vote by an oversight board co-chaired by Ritter and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. The grants have gone to governments and nonprofits in 35 of the 55 communities that meet eligibility standards assessing economic need and poverty.
State procurement rules, such as obtaining multiple appraisals to purchase land, are enforced.
Youth Services Prevention Grants
A decade ago, the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus negotiated an unusual deal that has held to this day: the creation of Youth Services Prevention grants, their recipients chosen by caucus members. 
Each of its 37 members can direct $150,000 annually in grants, up from $100,000 in recent years. This year, for the first time, four South Asian lawmakers were allotted the same. The grants are administered by the Judicial Department. 
Members of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus say their handling of Youth Services Prevention Grants might provide a model for improving the performance of other grant recipients. 
Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, a caucus member and long-time co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said the grants were negotiated after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.
Urban lawmakers and community advocates said the killing of 20 students and six educators was understandably galvanizing, and it led to passage of some of the nation’s strongest gun safety laws. But they said the reaction underscored to them the tolerance of a steady and largely unnoticed of violence claiming the lives of urban young.
The Youth Service Prevention grants and a related Youth Violence Initiative were the responses from legislative leaders.
Part of the earmarks controlled by the caucus are paying the Tow Youth Justice Institute and the University of New Haven to develop and run a performance-based accountability tool to train and assess Youth Service Prevention grantees.
“When you try and demonstrate the inequities of things that are going on in different neighborhoods, you’ve got to have the data to prove it, and then you’ve also got to prove there are better ways of doing it,” Walker said.
The Judicial Department requires grantees to report an annual summary of activities and individuals served but does not do a performance evaluation.
Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, the chair of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, said the project with Tow takes the next step.
“It’s really laid out in a way that holds folks accountable, make sure they’re doing the work they say they’re doing, and doesn’t make this just a pot of money that goes poof — but something we can really point as making an impact,” Felipe said. “I think that our model is something that folks should feel free to try to emulate.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024_0813_SR_Primaries_029-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-31 05:56:43.116561
