(Getty Images)The past year saw a number of significant actions at the state and federal levels that could transform how health care is delivered and financed in 2026 and the years to come.
The consequences of these choices have yet to be fully felt by Floridians. But they definitely are on the near horizon.
In considering the most inportant Florida health care stories of the year, the Florida Phoenix reached out to associations that represent consumers, providers, insurers, beneficiaries, and think tanks.
 Vaccines

Three months after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis, announced their goal to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida regulations and statutes, the state held a public meeting in Panama City Beach in December to take input from interested parties. 
For three hours, Florida Department of Health officials heard public testimony on proposed rules changes to remove requirements for children attending public and private schools to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccines. The proposal also would eliminate from rule the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for admission to a licensed day care facility.

The proposed rule also would broaden the religious exemption parents can use to refuse vaccines to include personal or philosophical opposition. 
Additionally, the proposed rule would allow parents, guardians, and college and university applicants aged 18-23 to opt out of disclosing their vaccination status to the Florida SHOTS program. SHOTS is how the state collects vaccination data. The new language tracks a 2019 law change.
The changes, some argue, conflict with the DOH’s statutory mission to operate a communicable disease prevention and control program that includes school immunization. The agency is charged by statute to ensure that “all children in this state” are immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases.
Health care lobbyist and Jacksonville attorney Christopher Nuland told the Phoenix, “People absolutely are in tither over both sides of the argument.” He predicted litigation over the proposed rule changes “will bleed over into the [2026] legislative session.”
Ladapo and DeSantis announced during a September press conference that they’d like to see all vaccine mandates eliminated. While the DOH has control over its rules, it cannot eliminate the statutorily mandated school vaccines — only the Legislature can do that. Florida law requires public and private school students to be vaccinated for polio, diphtheria, measles, German measles, whooping cough, and tetanus.
The surgeon general this past fall praised the Legislature and went so far as saying he “loves our lawmakers.” But Ladapo also issued an ultimatum. “They’re going to have to make decisions, right? That’s the way that this becomes possible. So, people are going to have to make a decision. People are going to have to, have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
 Developmental disabilities and Medicaid 

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities now can remain on Medicaid once they qualify and no longer will have to renew annually. House Speaker Daniel Perez championed lifelong eligibility for these Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as for the aged who live in institutions or receive home and community services, during the 2025 session.
“Someone who has been diagnosed as being permanently disabled should not have to re-certify as being permanently disabled every year. Unfortunately, that person isn’t going to be able to move away from that,” Perez explained in June.
A legislative staff analysis notes that between April 2023 and February 2025, “approximately 534 disabled individuals lost their Medicaid coverage because they failed to provide information” to the state to make an eligibility determination. 










When we look back at the successes of this session, we’ll look back at this pilot program as one of our greatest victories.


– House Speaker Daniel Perez


Additionally, the Legislature expanded statewide what had been a limited managed care pilot program for people with intellectual disabilities via HB 1103, which DeSantis signed into law in June.
“When we look back at the successes of this session, we’ll look back at this pilot program as one of our greatest victories. It probably will never be a headline, it’s probably not anything that most people will fundraise off of or campaign off of. But what I can tell you, I think for me and when I’m long gone and everyone forgets who I am and the names of many people in this chamber, they will remember that we potentially got rid of the wait list” for Medicaid services for people with intellectual disabilities.
 ‘Free kill’ veto 

A multi-year push to repeal what critics have called Florida’s “free kill” law involving medical negligence made it past the 2025 legislative finish line only to be vetoed by DeSantis. The House chose not to initiate a veto override.
HB 6017 put an end to a 35-year law preventing parents of single, childless, adult offspring and adult offspring of single parents who die from medical malpractice from filing wrongful death suits against hospitals and physicians.
DeSantis scheduled a press conference to veto the bill, appearing alongside Ladapo, Lee Health President Dr. Lawrence Antonucci, and others who supported the veto.
“If this legislation would be enacted, it would lead to higher costs for Floridians, it would lead to less care for Floridians, and it would make it harder for us to keep, recruit, and maintain physicians in the state of Florida,” the governor said.

DeSantis said he could be swayed to support ending the ban, though, if the Legislature placed limits on non-economic damages in all medical malpractice lawsuits, as well as limits on attorney fees. The caps that DeSantis covets are being pushed by organized medical, insurance, and business interests, but they were rejected during the 2025 session by a one-vote margin in the Senate. The caps, to date, have been a non-starter in the Florida House.
Like vaccines, this 2025 issue will spill over into the 2026 session, the last for DeSantis as governor. The House already has fast-tracked the issue. HB 6003 has cleared all its committees of reference and is ready for a House floor vote. The bill has attracted 73 lobbyist registrations. To date, no Senate companion has been filed.
 Soaring health insurance rates

Since the inception of the Affordable Care Act (often referred to as Obamacare) exchange, Florida has led the nation in the number of people enrolling to purchase subsidized health insurance plans. Florida enrollment topped 4.7 million people for 2025.
Despite the millions who rely on the coverage, Florida insurance officials decided not to warn Florida residents enrolled in the exchange that their health premiums would go up.
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A review by KFF, the health care analysis organization, of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs and use of services plus the loss of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits as the reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Although Montana State Auditor James Brown issued a statement Aug. 1 advising residents in that state of the impending increases, it’s not clear what if anything Florida insurance officials were doing to get the word out to people before Nov. 15, when open enrollment for 2026 coverage began.
Small business owner Carlos Otero, 60, has relied on the Affordable Care Act for years. Otero in December said that to keep his 2025 health plan in effect for 2026 would have cost him 900% more. He called it a “surprise incremental increase.”
Big Beautiful: Medicaid and rural health
Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act orders roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid reductions over 10 years beginning in 2028. 
Florida has not expanded Medicaid under the ACA, so many of the cuts to Obamacare expansion states don’t apply here. But the state isn’t completely spared, and the new law changes how the state finances supplemental Medicaid payments to 280 acute care hospitals, two federally designated cancer hospitals, faculty physician practices at medical schools, and faculty physician practices at public hospitals.  
The supplemental payment programs are not funded with state general revenue dollars but rather through taxes providers impose upon themselves and intergovernmental transfers.
The reductions in supplemental payment programs won’t come immediately. In fact, Florida Medicaid Deputy Director Brian Meyer told members of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee the state expects the feds to to approve a $7.8 billion plan to finance the supplemental hospital-directed payment program this year. 
That’s more than double the $3.3 billion for the program in the 2024-25 fiscal year. That money will bridge the shortfall between the state’s Medicaid rates and the amount it costs hospital to provide the care. 
But to comply with the law, the $7.8 billion for the program will be pared back by $3.2 billion over eight years, landing at $4.6 billion in FY 2034-35, according to Meyer’s presentation.
Perhaps to lessen the blow, Meyer told members the $4.6 billion landing point for the program will be higher than the $3.3 billion in the program last year.
Compliance with the reductions will affect additional Medicaid supplemental payment programs that enhance the traditional payments to cancer hospitals, physician faculty plans at medial schools, and physician plans at public hospitals so they are closer to the average rates paid by commercial health insurers. 
The cuts to the four direct-payment programs would total nearly $3.6 billion by FY 2034-35.

In addition to cutting Medicaid, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act establishes the five-year, $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, which provides states access to $10 billion in grants from 2026 through 2030. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced Monday that Florida will receive $209 million in federal funds to bolster rural health care for nearly 1.2 million people who live in 31 rural counties across the state.  
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris announced last month she’d like to have the rural health grant applications posted to the agency’s website in January or February.
Senate President Ben Albritton also made rural health care a priority as part of his “Rural Renaissance” bill. While it didn’t make it past the finish line during the 2025 session, the bill has been refiled for consideration for the 2026 session that begins Jan. 13.
SNAP
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces federal spending on the supplemental nutrition assistance program by $156 billion over a decade. SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes.
To reach that $156 billion target, the federal government is increasing how much it requires state government to contribute to administrative costs, upping that amount from 50% to 75%. That means Florida needs an additional $50.6 million next year to cover the costs of employees and call centers that are integral to the program’s success. The new law also requires the states to contribute to the costs of the benefits, which will also drive up the state’s costs.
In November, nearly 3 million residents who rely on SNAP lost their benefits during the federal government shutdown.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Alaska was awarded more federal money than any state besides Texas for a federal rural health initiative, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced on Monday.
The money will come from the Rural Health Transformation Fund, a $50 billion program set up as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and intended to counteract the effects of its sweeping Medicaid cuts in rural areas.
Alaska’s congressional delegation and state officials lauded the federal investment, which will be upwards of $272 million in Alaska in 2026.
At a Wednesday news conference in Anchorage, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said the $1.36 billion the state is slated to receive over the next five years is the biggest investment from the federal government to Alaska’s health care system in state history.
“This is a generational opportunity for our state,” he said.
Heidi Hedberg, commissioner of the state’s health department said a major goal is to rework the state’s “fragmented” health system. 
She said the agency will release more information about its plan for the money in the coming days, but pointed to the state’s application to the program, which outlines six priorities: maternal and child health, access to services, preventative care, a strengthened workforce, financial sustainability and updated technology and data systems.
Emily Ricci, the agency’s deputy commissioner, said that core to the state’s application was the question of how to support services that already exist in the state.
“Part of our focus was making sure that the tribal communities could see some of the ways that they want to sustain their programs and evolve or build their programs out further into something that provides more access and sustainable costs,” she said. “So I would say that those opportunities are written in each one of the initiatives.”
She did not immediately supply specific examples.
The state’s application also commits to adherence to several policies favored by the Trump administration, including a pledge to join licensure compacts and prohibit the use of federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to buy soda pop by 2027.
Several of those commitments require the approval of the state’s legislature or medical board.
Hedberg said her agency will work with those decision makers to follow through on the commitments the state made in its application.
In a virtual meeting with reporters after the state’s news conference, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, challenged the state administration and legislators to take on the question of rebuilding the state’s health care system as a major issue.
In response to a reporter’s question, she said she was worried about the reliability of the funding because the state could fail to make the most of the opportunity or because the federal government could pause or cancel the funding.
“I know that we’re going into an election year next year. I know that the Permanent Fund always takes up space. I know we’re going to be talking about the gas line,” she said. “But we must, we must absolutely be talking about this health care opportunity that we have in front of us now.”

Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live
For the first time in more than a decade, visitors are being invited to experience N.C. Wyeth’s largest and most ambitious mural up close, in a setting designed specifically for its scale, history, and meaning. The Brandywine Museum of Art has launched the N.C. Wyeth Mural Experience, a guided and immersive journey that brings together American art, regional conservation, and family legacy, culminating at Point Lookout Farm.
At the heart of the experience is Apotheosis of the Family, a monumental mural painted by N.C. Wyeth in 1932. Measuring 19 feet high and 60 feet long, it is the largest work the artist ever created. The mural was originally commissioned by the Wilmington Savings Fund Society to mark the bank’s centennial and was installed as a permanent fixture in the grand banking hall of its downtown Wilmington building. For decades, it greeted customers as both a work of art and a civic statement.
When the WSFS building was sold in 2007, the mural was carefully removed by specialists and placed into storage. While the painted surface remained in good condition, the method used to install the mural in 1932 created long-term conservation challenges. The canvas had been affixed to a plastered brick wall using a lead white adhesive mixed with linseed oil, a common practice at the time that created an exceptionally strong bond. As a result, plaster adhered to the back of the canvas during removal, making conservation of the mural’s reverse side the primary concern.
After nearly 15 years in storage, a new conservation effort began in 2022. Over the course of three years, conservators worked one panel at a time, carefully removing plaster residue from the back of the canvas while safely encapsulating the lead-based material. This painstaking process prepared the mural for its return to public view.
Rather than reinstalling the mural in a traditional gallery setting, the Wyeth Foundation for American Art and the Brandywine Museum of Art envisioned a more immersive and intimate way for visitors to encounter the work. A custom-designed round barn was constructed at Point Lookout Farm, a nearly 220-acre working horse farm owned by N.C. Wyeth’s grandson, artist Jamie Wyeth.
Point Lookout Farm carries deep historical and cultural significance of its own. The property was originally purchased in 1903 by Phyllis Wyeth’s great-grandfather, a member of the du Pont family, and has remained in the family for four generations. Phyllis Mills Wyeth, Jamie Wyeth’s late wife, was an avid equestrian, thoroughbred breeder, and conservationist. She played a formative role in the early years of the Brandywine Conservancy, serving on its Board of Trustees from 1967 to 1971.
In the late 1960s, widespread industrial development threatened the Brandywine region and its water resources, including supplies serving Wilmington. In response, a group of residents came together to protect vulnerable land, laying the groundwork for what became the Brandywine Conservancy. Phyllis and Jamie Wyeth were among the organization’s original conservation easement grantors in 1969, preserving land along the Brandywine Creek. Additional easements followed in 2001, ensuring that Point Lookout Farm would remain protected as open and agricultural land in perpetuity.
The mural experience reflects this intertwined legacy of art and conservation. Tours begin at the N.C. Wyeth Studio, a National Historic Landmark, where visitors explore the artist’s mural practice. From there, guests travel by passenger van through preserved countryside managed by the Brandywine Conservancy before arriving at Point Lookout Farm.
On the farm, visitors pass through an open horse stable that once housed Union Rags, the 2012 Belmont Stakes-winning thoroughbred bred by Phyllis Wyeth. Descendants of Union Rags still live on the property today. Emerging from the stable, guests encounter sweeping views of the landscape before walking down a grassy path to the round barn that houses Apotheosis of the Family.
The barn itself was custom-designed to complement the mural. Measuring 62 feet in diameter and topped by a windowed cupola, the structure draws inspiration from historic round barns, Shaker architecture, and horse walkers used to cool down horses after exercise. Natural light floods the space through high windows, while adjustable lighting enhances the mural without overpowering it. The artwork is mounted on curved aluminum and steel frames that allow it to hover just off the wall’s surface.
Understanding the mural’s subject matter deepens the experience. The term “apotheosis” refers to glorification, a tradition in art often reserved for saints or historical figures. In this case, Wyeth elevates the family itself, placing parents and children at the center of an Arcadian landscape inspired by the Roman poet Virgil. The mural depicts all four seasons at once, along with every stage of human life, from infancy to old age. Wyeth used members of his own family as models, including a teenage Andrew Wyeth, who appears as the central archer.
The N.C. Wyeth Mural Experience is offered as a guided tour with advance reservations required. Tickets are released in three-month increments, with current availability extending through March 28, 2026. Pricing is $50 for Brandywine Museum of Art members and $70 for non-members. Each tour is limited to six participants and lasts approximately one hour and 40 minutes. Tickets include all-day admission to the Brandywine Museum of Art, guided visits to the N.C. Wyeth Studio and Point Lookout Farm, transportation by passenger van, and an audio guide. Children under 12 are not permitted on the tour. Tickets and additional details are available at https://www.brandywine.org/museum/studio-tours/nc-wyeth-mural-experience.
Today, the N.C. Wyeth Mural Experience offers visitors a rare opportunity to engage deeply with one of the most significant works of American mural painting. By weaving together art, conservation, architecture, and personal history, the experience reintroduces Apotheosis of the Family not just as a masterpiece of scale, but as a living reflection of the values that have shaped the Brandywine region for generations.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apotheosis-mural-wide-2-1.jpg,,,2025-12-29 18:57:36.831624

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Iowa’s rural health care improvement plan, “Healthy Hometowns,” was awarded $209 million Monday as part of a federal funding program under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services said the federal funding will help fulfill the state program’s goal of creating “healthier communities and better outcomes.”
The federal Rural Health Transformation Program was authorized by Republicans’ big spending bill enacted over the summer and is set to allocate $50 billion to states between 2026 and 2030. The program was meant to help offset the estimated $137 billion decline, according to KFF, in rural Medicaid spending over the next 10 years under the “one big beautiful” law.

Iowa’s plan prioritizes partnerships among rural health care providers, efforts to improve cancer prevention and outcomes, accessible health records and investments in telehealth and mobile centers, according to a news release from the state. 
“This program is an incredible opportunity to advance health care in rural Iowa,” Reynolds said in the release. “We’re grateful to the Trump Administration for this investment in our state, and we’re ready to innovate care delivery in ways that improve health, well-being, and quality of life for Iowans statewide.”
States had to apply for the funding in the fall and received notice Monday of award amounts which ranged from $281 million for Texas, to $147 million awarded to New Jersey.
Iowa’s Healthy Hometowns program will initiate hub-and-spoke networks of care and create residency positions at teaching hospitals in the hopes of recruiting and retaining health care professionals in rural communities, both of which were provisions of Reynolds’ 2025 rural health care law.
The program aims to address Iowa’s rising cancer rates by improving access to screening, creating cancer specific hubs and upgrading equipment. A fact sheet on the program from HHS said it would also invest in cancer prevention methods like radon testing and mitigation, mammograms, colonoscopies and other screening methods.

The state’s program will also invest in telehealth technology that will bring  prenatal, postpartum, post-surgery discharge, chronic disease management, and other types of care to easily accessible sites in rural communities. 
Iowa’s Republican congressional delegates voiced support for the program, which if funded at a similar level each year through 2030, would garner more than $1 billion for rural Iowa health care improvements. 
Sen. Chuck Grassley said the funding was the “largest federal investment in rural health care in history.” 
“It’s fantastic news that Iowa will receive $209 million in the next year to support its Healthy Hometowns program and revitalize rural care across the state,” Grassley said in a statement. “I thank Governor Reynolds and her team for working with my office and our congressional delegation to make this substantial investment in Iowa health care.”
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said the funding would save lives and “strengthen” rural communities. 
“Access to high-quality health care should never depend on your zip code, and today, we’re delivering on that promise,” Miller-Meeks said in a news release. “This $209 million investment will bring top-tier care closer to home for families, seniors, and veterans in every corner of our state.” 
Rep. Zach Nunn said the funding will “strengthen care close to home, expand access through telehealth, and help rural clinics recruit and retain the providers Iowa communities rely on.”
Rep. Randy Feenstra celebrated the allocation, said it would save lives in rural Iowa and that he would work to “ensure all Iowans have access to high-quality, affordable care.”
“This funding will support rapid emergency medical services in Iowa, keep our rural hospitals open and operational, and make high-quality healthcare more accessible and affordable for Iowans,” Feenstra said in a news release.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) Despite calling out the Utah Legislature’s attorneys for failing to appeal her previous redistricting rulings at more appropriate junctures, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson has issued a ruling allowing lawmakers to appeal one of her decisions throwing out the state’s 2021 congressional map.
Gibson, in a decision issued late Friday, denied the Legislature’s attorneys’ request that she issue a final judgement on the entire lawsuit challenging redistricting in Utah — which would have finalized the whole case. 
Instead, she decided to allow a narrower appeal specifically for her Aug. 25 ruling, which preliminarily voided Utah’s 2021 congressional map as the result of an unconstitutional process and blocked a law that lawmakers approved that year, SB200. 
That law repealed and replaced a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that enacted an independent redistricting process — a move that Gibson decided violated Utahns’ constitutional right to alter and reform their government.

Depending on the outcome of the 2026 midterm-elections, Utah’s redistricting lawsuit could potentially tip the scales on which party controls the U.S. House. But that also depends on whether Utah’s current court-ordered map with one Democratic-leaning district and three Republican districts stands — or if the Legislature successfully appeals Gibson’s order tossing out the voided 2021 congressional map, which included four Republican districts. 
A request for comment to House and Senate Republican legislative leaders wasn’t immediately returned Monday. 
‘This was not an easy call’
In her ruling issued Friday, Gibson said she’s leaving it up to the Utah Supreme Court to decide whether the Legislature’s appeal is proper. 
“This was not an easy call,” the judge wrote.  
The Legislature’s attorneys “had a direct, non-discretionary right to immediately and directly appeal to the Utah Supreme Court” both Gibson’s Aug. 25 order, as well as another order she issued Nov. 10 that blocked the Legislature’s preferred remedial map, known as map C, and instead picked a map drawn by the plaintiffs to be used in the 2026 elections. 
That ruling was celebrated by the lawsuits’ plaintiffs — including voting rights groups the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government — and the anti-gerrymanding group Better Boundaries, which successfully pursued Proposition 4. 
The resulting new, court-ordered congressional map was also celebrated by Democrats because it created one compact district around northern Salt Lake County that leans Democratic. Previously, all four of Utah’s congressional districts leaned Republican. 
The ruling angered Republicans, with some GOP lawmakers accusing Gibson of violating the Utah Constitution by picking a map that wasn’t drawn or approved by lawmakers. Last month, top Republican legislative leaders vowed to appeal the case to the Utah Supreme Court. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

However, lawmakers’ attorneys haven’t yet appealed any of Gibson’s rulings — even though the judge said they could have for both the Aug. 25 ruling and the Nov. 10 ruling.
“While it was the Legislative Defendants’ duty to seek appellate review of these decisions as soon as possible (if in fact that is what they wanted), they have offered no legitimate explanation for failing to do so when they had the chance, either by interlocutory appeal or by exercising their statutory right to immediately appeal an injunction of a state law,” Gibson wrote. “Nonetheless, this Court still believes that there is no reason to delay appellate review.” 
So Gibson decided to grant the Legislature’s attorney’s motion for a Rule 54(b) certification on her Aug. 25 order. A Rule 54(b) certification allows some of her rulings to be certified as final for immediate appeal if the court has decided that there is no reason for delay. 
“This case is unique,” she wrote. “Most cases before district courts involve private parties and private transactions. Redistricting cases are the exact opposite. They are very public and have a state wide impact. Every Utah voter, every Utah congressional candidate and arguably every Utah citizen is impacted by this case.”
Issuing a final ruling on even just a portion of the case, she wrote, “ultimately serves the public’s interest and will lead to a faster resolution of the entire case.” 
Gibson acknowledged that if she doesn’t certify her Aug. 25 ruling as final now, “any appellate review will have to wait until the end of the case, which could be months to years away.” 
So, Gibson said she’s leaving the question to the Utah Supreme Court. 
“Until there is a final decision on these legal issues from our Supreme Court, there will be a cloud (over) Utah’s congressional elections and an open question regarding the power of the Legislature and the power of the people,” she wrote. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The Utah Supreme Court, she added “can decide now if the Legislature is the sole and exclusive authority over redistricting in Utah or if it shares that responsibility with the people.”
“It can decide if the people of Utah, through the exercise of their right to alter or reform government through a citizen initiative, can also pass binding laws regarding how the Legislature performs its redistricting duty,” Gibson wrote. “And the Utah Supreme Court should decide now if the order granting the permanent injunction of S.B. 200 and the 2021 Congressional Map should stand or if it should be vacated.” 
Gibson added that there is “no just reason to delay the Utah Supreme Court’s review of those legal rulings” in the Aug. 25 order. 
“There is no reason to delay bringing some finality on these important issues to the people of Utah,” she wrote. 
Why hasn’t the Legislature appealed yet? 
That’s a question Gibson’s Friday ruling raises, pointing out the Legislature’s attorneys had multiple opportunities to do so. 
A clarification hearing held on Dec. 22, “confirmed what the court suspected,” Gibson wrote. 
“With election deadlines imminent, the Legislative Defendants repeatedly stated they intended to appeal but then intentionally elected not to utilize the more appropriate appellate tools available to them,” Gibson wrote, adding that they could have petitioned to appeal any one of her interlocutory orders within 21 days of any of her previous three orders. 
She also wrote they could have filed a direct appeal to the Utah Supreme Court within 30 days of each other and obtained an expedited appellate ruling based on her Aug. 25 ruling that blocked the 2021 congressional map and her Nov. 10 order that blocked the Legislature’s remedial map submission, known as map C.

“Instead, the Legislative Defendants attempt to argue to this Court that this entire case and Plaintiffs’ Count V are ‘essentially’ final,” she wrote. “That is, they contend all of the relief that can be given in this case has been, and we are ‘close enough’ to call this case done.”
In her ruling, Gibson expressed frustration with the position she’s been put in. 
“Quite literally – this Court is between the proverbial rock and a hard spot,” she wrote. “This entire case is not ‘final.’ … But the Court agrees that the important legal issues decided by this Court and reflected in each of its rulings … should be reviewed by the Utah Supreme Court as quickly as possible. But this Court and the Utah Supreme Court are bound by the law and by procedure on how we proceed.”
She wrote that the proposed final judgement submitted by the Legislature’s attorneys “does not actually reflect the legal status of this case or the status of the various claims in the case.”
“This case is far from over and is not yet final,” Gibson said. 
She added that there are several unadjudicated claims in the case, and it continues to be actively litigated. 
“Utah law does not authorize this Court to just ‘deem’ that issues are effectively resolved or enter a proposed final judgment because some relief has been granted,” she wrote. 
While the Legislature “would like this case to be over, there is no legal basis supporting entry of a final judgement,” she wrote, denying the motion to issue a summary judgement on Utah’s ongoing redistricting lawsuit.

The Delaware State Police have announced funeral arrangements for Cpl. Grade One , the 34-year-old trooper who was murdered in the line of duty on Dec. 23, 2025, while protecting a coworker at the Wilmington Division of Motor Vehicles.
Services honoring Snook’s life, service, and sacrifice will be held Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, at the Bob Carpenter Center on the University of Delaware campus, located at 631 S. College Ave., Newark.
A public visitation will take place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. At the conclusion of the visitation, a pass and review will be conducted by all uniformed emergency services personnel in attendance. A memorial service will immediately follow.
Final honors will be presented outside the Bob Carpenter Center following the service, with all ceremonial events expected to conclude at approximately 3 p.m.
DSP officials have asked the public to rely on official department announcements for accurate information regarding service details, traffic impacts, and public access.
A Community Responds to Sacrifice
Snook is widely credited with saving the life of a DMV employee by pushing them out of the line of fire before he was fatally shot. Law-enforcement leaders have described his actions as an example of extraordinary bravery and selflessness.
In the days since his death, Delaware residents, law-enforcement agencies, alumni groups, and supporters across the country have rallied around Snook’s wife, Lauren, and their 1-year-old daughter, Letty, through vigils, memorials, and fundraising efforts.

Nativity Prep graduates attend more than two dozen public, charter, independent, and Catholic high schools across the region and maintain a 95% high school graduation rate—well above national averages for similar student populations.
 
WILMINGTON, Del. — The Board of Trustees of Nativity Preparatory School of Wilmington has appointed Dr. Tony Alleyne as the school’s next president, effective Jan. 5, 2026.
Alleyne is the founder and executive director of Delaware College Scholars, a statewide nonprofit that provides college-access programming for first-generation students. He will succeed Interim President Brendan Kennealey.
Founded in 2003, Nativity Prep is a tuition-free Catholic middle school for boys that serves students from Wilmington regardless of religious background. The school follows the Nativity Miguel Model, an extended-day, extended-year approach designed to provide academic rigor, structured support, and character formation beyond a traditional school schedule.
According to Brian Ray, the outgoing President, Nativity Prep graduates attend more than two dozen public, charter, independent, and Catholic high schools across the region and maintain a 95% high school graduation rate—well above national averages for similar student populations. The school credits its outcomes to small class sizes, academic enrichment, mentorship, and long-term student support that extends beyond eighth grade. The curriculum also requires that incoming fifth graders master reading and work skills in the first year at the school before spending three years getting these students ready to compete in area high schools.
Board Chair Pat Blewett said Alleyne’s experience aligns with the school’s mission of preparing students for success in college preparatory high schools and beyond.
Alleyne brings more than 20 years of experience in education and nonprofit leadership. At Delaware College Scholars, he grew the organization from its founding to serve more than 600 students statewide, raised more than $10 million in funding, and managed a $1.2 million annual budget. The program later expanded to Charlotte, North Carolina, under the name Queen City Scholars.
Before launching Delaware College Scholars, Alleyne spent about a decade at St. Andrew’s School in Middletown, where he served in multiple roles including teacher, coach, dorm parent, college counselor, and senior admissions administrator. He later became senior associate and interim director of admissions.
Earlier in his career, Alleyne taught middle school social studies in Charlotte, North Carolina, through Teach For America. He has also worked internationally as a college counseling consultant in Shanghai.
Alleyne holds a doctorate in educational leadership from the University of Pennsylvania, a master’s degree from Columbia University’s Klingenstein Center, and bachelor’s degrees from Wesleyan University.
In a statement, Alleyne said Nativity Prep’s focus on long-term student success and whole-child development reflects his own professional background.
The Rev. Jack Kolodziej, OSFS, provincial of the Wilmington-Philadelphia Province of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, said Alleyne will build on the school’s established foundation and outcomes.
School officials said Alleyne is working with the board and interim leadership on a transition plan. Nativity Prep’s mission, programs, and student support model will remain unchanged.
Alleyne will assume full responsibility for leading the school on Jan. 5, 2026.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Darnell-Vaughn-Jr.-Esaias-Guthrie-Michael-Crippen-Brandon-Wingo.jpg,,,2025-12-29 17:57:25.391494

A Utah judge on Monday reiterated that prosecutors or defense attorneys seeking to close off any future court hearings to the press and public must notify several news organizations, giving the journalists a chance to review the motions for closure and raise their objections. 
Fourth District Judge Tony Graf didn’t address the larger question of whether news cameras will be banned from the courtroom in future hearings. Defense attorneys have indicated they will seek to limit future media access.

Tyler Robinson, 22, is charged with aggravated murder, a capital offense, and six other counts in the Sept. 10 killing of Kirk, a conservative political activist and close ally of President Donald Trump. Prosecutors said if he is convicted, they intend to seek the death penalty. 
Robinson is accused of firing a single shot, killing Kirk while he was speaking to a crowd of thousands in a courtyard at Utah Valley University in Orem. His defense attorneys have largely focused their arguments on the immense publicity of the case and its potential effects on would-be jurors, though it could be years before any jury hears the case. 
Robinson’s defense attorney Kathryn Nester declined to comment on Monday. 
Graf denied requests from two news media coalitions to intervene as official parties, saying they don’t need that status to advocate for the public’s right to know what happens in court. 
Judge punts on news cameras in the courtroom in Charlie Kirk murder case

Jeff Hunt, a First Amendment attorney representing some of the news organizations, said the judge’s comments were encouraging nonetheless.
“I think if you listened to the judge this morning, he takes his role very seriously as a guardian of public access and transparency, while still protecting the rights of the defendant,” Hunt said. 
The judge also ordered the release of a transcript and audio from an Oct. 24 hearing, which was closed to the press and public, that focused on whether Robinson had to wear shackles and a jail uniform. Graf said he allowed the redactions of 246 words – or about one page out of 80 – that reference court security measures. 
The transcript is expected to be released later Monday and the audio in about two weeks, the judge said.
“This case generates extraordinary ongoing national and international attention, some of which is threatening in nature to the parties, the representatives and non-party participants,” Graf said.
He previously ruled Robinson must wear physical restraints when in court but can wear civilian clothes.

“These resources will help us modernize rural health care, support the workforce that delivers it, and ensure that all South Dakotans have access to quality care – no matter where they live,” South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a news release.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced Monday that all 50 states received funding from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Half of the new program’s funding is predicated on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. The federal agency announced award amounts for 2026. Award amounts can change each year.
South Dakota requested $200 million a year, or $1 billion over five years. The state received about $189 million for 2026.
Some states, including Nebraska, Montana and Iowa, received more funding than requested.
According to the health policy research group KFF, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas in South Dakota over the next decade will decrease by a projected $487 million, due largely to new work requirements in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that will cause some people to lose coverage.
Regionalization, telehealth, data-sharing: SD applies for $1 billion from federal rural health fund

A key component of South Dakota’s application to the rural health fund was a $500 million health infrastructure modernization proposal, which would include creation of a “South Dakota Health Data Atlas.” It would allow health care systems throughout the state to access health data in one “single, accessible platform.” The atlas would address telecommunications needs, equipment, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity concerns.
Other proposals ranged from $3.5 million to support the growth of community health workers in the state to $125 million to fund sustainability grants for South Dakota health care providers.

Cities rise and fall, but it is a real loss to see Burlington fall this far. I miss the city it used to be.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Carolyn Van Vleck: How ideology helped derail Burlington.","Dear Editor,



I am honestly astonished that Burlington, our former Queen City, is now demanding help from the state to clean up its own mess. What went wrong? Too many bad decisions by local government, driven by ideology rather than common sense.
I’ve lived in the Burlington area several times and worked on Church Street. It was once a great city — a wonderful place to people-watch, shop and eat. Vermont has always been expensive, and I don’t begrudge anyone who wants to move here. But as an independent voter, I’ve watched an influx of people pushing policies so far left that they seem more interested in proving Vermont is “different” than in preserving what made it work. That is not the Vermont way.

I remember Burlington’s knee-jerk reaction after George Floyd’s death, when the city dismantled much of its police force. I’ve read proposals to build facilities where drug users can inject safely. Are we serious? We should be helping people get off drugs, not enabling addiction. Anyone paying attention could see the increase in drug problems coming, especially after expanded rail connections brought new traffic into the city.
City leaders now claim people avoid Church Street because of construction. That’s not true. People stay away because of unchecked drug use, aggressive panhandling and a growing homeless population that local services cannot manage. I have friends who lived downtown for decades and no longer go there. They want to support local businesses, but not at the expense of their own safety.
I care deeply about helping Vermonters, especially families and seniors who have lost housing through no fault of their own. But it is neither fair nor sustainable to ask taxpayers to support everyone who arrives expecting open-ended social services. At some point, people should have to prove residency, contribute and work toward self-sufficiency.
Cities rise and fall. But it is a real loss to see Burlington fall this far. I miss the city it used to be.

The Joint Committee on Election Laws recommended companion bills, H 868 and S 507, which are now before the House and Senate Ways and Means committees. The votes signal interest among lawmakers in updating laws that critics say have not kept pace with the scale and sophistication of modern ballot campaigns.
The Ballot Spending Transparency Act would expand what ballot question committees must report to the Office of Campaign and Political Finance (OCPF), increase the frequency of required filings, and more clearly define non-cash political support that currently can remain largely out of public view for much of a campaign cycle.
Sen. John Keenan (D-Quincy) co-chairs the Election Laws Committee and said the volume and scope of ballot questions moving through the initiative petition process played a role in his decision to advance the bill.
“I think the number of ballot questions that have been proposed for the upcoming election kind of reinforced the need for this,” Keenan said in an interview. “These ballot questions oftentimes, whether it’s one side or the other, they’re very well financed, and the public has a right to know, and should know, where the money’s coming from behind each side of the argument.”
Election officials are reviewing nearly 150 boxes of signatures submitted by campaigns, and as many as 12 questions could be presented to voters in November 2026. The measures span a wide range of policy areas, including tax policy, rent control, public records access, election reforms and housing development.
Keenan said that when voters are inundated with ads, transparency about who is paying for them becomes critical. “People turn on the TV or look at social media, and they’re hit with these ads about a ballot question, and they really don’t know where they’re coming from,” he said. “This makes the whole process more transparent. It allows people to get a better sense of who’s behind these ads.”
Ballot question committees face less frequent reporting requirements than candidates for office, particularly during the first eight months of an election year, according to the bill summary from sponsor Rep. Daniel Ryan. Sen. Sal DiDomenico is the primary sponsor in the Senate. The legislation would close that gap by requiring more frequent pre-election reports and continued post-election filings until all debts are paid.
The bills would also add a statutory definition of “in-kind contributions,” covering non-cash support such as free or discounted goods and services, staff time, or expenses paid on a committee’s behalf. Ballot committees with questions on the statewide ballot would be required to itemize in-kind contributions worth more than $50, disclose new debts or liabilities, and explain why those obligations were incurred.
At an October hearing on the bills, the executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts urged lawmakers to act, pointing to dramatic growth in ballot question spending both nationally and in the Commonwealth.
“Initiative petitions are a powerful tool for direct democracy that enhance government responsiveness and increase citizen participation,” said Common Cause’s Geoff Foster. “But they can also be used by powerful special interests to buy their preferred public policies, and they often become colossal spending operations. Right now, our reporting requirements for ballot question committees are far too lax.”
Dev Chatterjee of Common Cause provided lawmakers with data compiled from OCPF filings showing the scale of the increase. In 2024 alone, Massachusetts ballot campaigns received more than $43 million in cash and in-kind contributions, he said, accounting for 3.4 percent of national ballot question spending even though the state represents about 2.1 percent of the US population.
Analyzing six election cycles, Common Cause found that ballot committees in Massachusetts raised more than $340 million, with roughly $120 million of that total coming in during months when no reporting was required. 
“That’s a massive amount of money moving through the system with no public visibility,” Chatterjee told lawmakers.
Legislative leaders, who exercise control over the traditional Beacon Hill agenda, have expressed unease over the role of well-financed interest groups in the initiative process. House Speaker Ron Mariano has questioned whether the state is drifting toward a California-style ballot system dominated by moneyed campaigns.
“It really makes me wonder: Are we becoming California, where you go out and get some money because there are very few financial restrictions on some of these special interest groups?” Mariano said in November, after Attorney General Andrea Campbell certified dozens of potential ballot questions.
Keenan said he expects some behind-the-scenes resistance from groups that have benefited from looser disclosure rules, but predicted it would be difficult for opponents to make their case publicly.
“I think it’s very difficult for those that support the ballot questions to come out publicly and say, ‘Oh, we don’t want you to know exactly how much we’re spending,'” he said.
Rep. Leigh Davis of Great Barrington, a member of the Election Laws Committee, called the proposal a “no-brainer” during the October hearing.
Ryan’s bill got a favorable committee recommendation in November and has bipartisan support, including from House and Senate Minority Leaders Brad Jones and Bruce Tarr.  Senate Election Laws Committee members also recommended their bill in November, with a 5-0 vote featuring support from Majority Leader Cindy Creem.
With the bills now headed to Ways and Means, lawmakers will weigh their fiscal impact and decide whether to advance them at a time when they will also be asked to weigh in on the merits of the 2026 ballot questions.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0531-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 16:56:57.833954

The secretary of state’s announcement is the latest development in political musical chairs ahead of the 2026 election. 
The post Chuck Gray announces bid for U.S. House appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray announced Monday he will run for U.S. House. 
“You elect me, they’re going to notice,” Gray said in a video posted on social media. “To make America great, we’ve gotta break a little China.” 
Gray is running for Wyoming’s sole congressional seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who announced earlier this month she would run for U.S. Senate. Hageman’s decision followed U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ announcement that she would not seek reelection. 
With the backing of President Donald Trump, voters elected Gray as secretary of state in 2022. He previously represented Casper’s House District 57 in the Wyoming Legislature for three terms. 
This will not be Gray’s first attempt at federal office. In 2021, he vowed to defeat then-Rep. Liz Cheney, but dropped out of the Republican primary race after Trump endorsed Hageman. 
Who’s Gray?
Gray became a permanent resident of Wyoming in 2012, according to previous WyoFile reporting. He began his career in 2013 at his father’s company, Mount Rushmore Broadcasting, after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania.
In 2017, he joined the Legislature, where he largely focused on anti-abortion legislation and changes to election law, including a 2021 voter ID mandate. 
Gray centered his campaign for secretary of state, which functions as the state’s chief election official, on election integrity, telling voters that Wyoming had “tremendous problems” with its elections. 
As part of that campaign, Gray sponsored several showings across the state of the film “2000 Mules,” which alleged that rampant “ballot harvesting” in swing states stole the 2020 election from Trump. When the conservative nonprofit whose claims the film was based on — True the Vote — admitted in 2024 that it did not have recordings, documents or other evidence backing its claims, Gray was silent. 
This summer, Gray, alongside the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has been issued yet. 
Earlier this year, Gray was named in his official capacity in a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law that requires residents to provide proof of citizenship and residency when registering to vote. In July, a federal court dismissed the case. 
Throughout his public service, Gray has been recognized by multiple conservative organizations. 
“Chuck’s record has earned recognition from leading conservative organizations, including multiple CPAC awards; the Wyoming Right to Life Platinum Award for his work on family, faith, and life-related policies; and the Club for Growth’s Defender of Economic Freedom Award,” according to his campaign website. “Guided by his Christian faith, Chuck Gray continues to fight to keep Wyoming free, conservative, and strong—leading with conviction, not convenience, and always following through for the people of Wyoming.”
Gray is the first candidate to announce a run for Wyoming’s sole congressional seat.

Working conditions for roughly 750 unionized corrections staff was the issue top of mind for members, according to a Vermont State Employees’ Association leader.

Vermont Department of Corrections staff will stick with their existing union. 
Prison workers and probation and parole staff voted 132-116 to stay with the Vermont State Employees’ Association rather than join the National Correctional Employees Union, which represents more than 50 local branches in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, according to results shared by the Vermont Labor Relations Board.  
This isn’t the first time an out-of-state union has failed to usurp the Vermont State Employees’ Association by seeking to represent Vermont’s roughly 750 unionized corrections workers. In 2021, the New England Police Benevolent Association filed a similar petition. Corrections staff later voted by a nearly two-to-one margin to remain in the state employees’ union.

Due to staffing shortages, prison staff are sometimes made to work 16-hour shifts. Those marathon days were top of mind as corrections employees voted, according to Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees’ Association.
“It was a tough campaign because of the challenging conditions on the ground,” he said. “Our win was based on the assessment that members made that we are in the best position to get the governor to do something.”
Bargaining between the state employees’ union and Gov. Phil Scott’s administration paused leading up to the vote, according to Howard. The process is a primary avenue for corrections staff to secure better conditions and pay, he said. 
A representative for the National Correctional Employees Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Greg Gianforte delivers the State of the State address before a joint session of the Montana Legislature on Jan. 13, 2025. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Montana is set to get $233 million dedicated to rural healthcare in 2026, the first award out of a federal fund that could net the state almost $1.2 billion over the next five years. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte and the state’s Department of Public Health and Human Services made the announcement on Monday. All 50 states received money through the Rural Health Transformation Program, which is being administered through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Montana received the fourth-most money of any state. Only Texas, Alaska and California received more.
“With this unprecedented funding, we are taking a major step toward modernizing Montana’s rural health care systems,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Thanks to President (Donald) Trump, we’re launching this program and making a long-term commitment to our rural communities by providing Montana families with the access to health care they deserve.”
The state health department will now submit a revised budget to CMS and will partner with the Montana Office of Rural Health to host biannual stakeholder meetings, the state press release said. The first meeting of that group will be on Thursday, Jan. 22.
While it is a significant amount of funding, some legislators have questioned if it’s enough.
“This is a Band-Aid coming from the federal government,” Rep. Cora Neumann, a Bozeman Democrat, said in November. 
The money will flow toward five large initiatives, the release said. This includes upgrading telehealth infrastructure, increasing healthcare employment, providing more healthcare in schools and supporting efforts to decrease emergency room visits. Data collection and digitizing rural health records are additionally a focus for the funding, according to the news release.
The application for the funding was submitted after feedback from Montana hospitals, all eight tribal nations, state agencies and 300 formal responses to a request for information from the state, according to TK.
“Every Montanan deserves top-level health care, no matter where they live,” state health department director Charlie Brereton said in a statement. “This landmark funding provides the resources we need to execute our plan, which includes stabilizing our most rural hospitals and bridging the health care divide for families living in every corner of our state.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SOTS_1-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-12-29 16:56:57.833954

Freezing temperatures and gusty winds may cause outages and poor road conditions to continue overnight.

Vermonters woke up Monday to roads covered in ice and sleet, thousands of homes without power and warnings that conditions may persist overnight.      
Burlington-based National Weather Service Meteorologist Conor Lahiff said northern and central Vermont east of the Green Mountains were hit hardest by the ice storm and outages. The western portion of the state saw a winter weather advisory, but Bennington and Windham counties faced less impact due to warmer temperatures, Lahiff said. 
Across the state, rainfall ranged from a quarter to a half inch, which caused an ice build up of one tenths of an inch to a quarter of an inch of ice in some areas, Lahiff said. Ice accumulation of two tenths of an inch or more can cause outages and more significant damage, he added.
“Temperatures across the area have generally warmed above freezing,” he said. “The areas that are hovering around freezing are little hollows in central and Northeast Kingdom Vermont.”
But Lahiff said temperatures will drop back down below freezing after sunset on Monday, so hazardous road conditions remain a concern especially on dirt roads.
Nonessential Vermont state offices were closed Monday because of weather conditions, and the Vermont State Police advised the public to avoid road travel amid the ice storm.
A vehicle crash in West Searsburg on Monday obstructed both lanes on Vermont Route 9, and Vermont State Police warned of delays and recommended taking alternative routes.

During one of the busiest snow sport weeks of the year, Jay Peak closed all operations on Monday, and several resorts such as Stowe, Sugarbush, Okemo and Bolton Valley delayed opening lifts due to the icing conditions. 
There were over 6,000 homes that lost power at the peak of the outages Monday morning, concentrated in the central Vermont region.
Green Mountain Power Director of Communications Kristin Kelly said the vast majority of the utility’s customers who were affected by the storm have power back on, but the utility is preparing for more outages due to gusty winds tonight. Of the 275,000 Green Mountain Power customers in the state, crews restored power for a total 8,900 homes as of Monday afternoon, Kelly said. 
“Crews have made really great progress since the ice began to accumulate in some locations, causing damage,” she said.

Louis Porter, general manager of Washington Electric Co-op which serves central Vermont, said the utility had restored around 4,000 customers’ power on Monday, including repeated repairs due to subsequent outages. 
“We expected to have some damage, to have some outages this morning, and we had extra crews come in, and we had our line crews start at five o’clock this morning,” Porter said. “It’s been a challenging restoration, in large part because the roads were so difficult to get to.” 
Along with hazardous road work conditions, especially in rural areas, Porter said ice is not loosening from trees as quickly as expected due to freezing temperatures, and projected winds overnight could cause more outages.
“We are hopeful to get all these current outages restored today, but as more come in, obviously, that extends the outage,” Porter said. “We’re still seeing additional incidents come in, so crews are going to continue working.”

(Photo by Getty Images)An Iowa judge has granted the former operators of Iowa’s troubled Honey Creek Resort a temporary injunction that blocks the state from proceeding with plans to hire a new operator for the south-central Iowa resort.
In his ruling, Polk County District Court Judge Jeffrey Farrell found that the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, despite a lack of justification to shut down the resort, “bullied forward” with its plans and terminated its contractual relationship with resort operators Terry and Beth Henderson of Achieva Enterprises.
The injunction means that DAS’ efforts to end its contract with Achieva is temporarily blocked until further order of the court. The state must now provide Achieva with immediate access to the resort, with all provisions of the company’s contract with DAS remaining in full effect.

Achieva “shall reopen the resort for customer use as soon as reasonably practicable, but at least by March 12, 2026,” Farrell’s order states. “This means that the lodge and cabins shall be open for customers by that date and the golf course shall be open for play by that date, weather permitting.”
Honey Creek Resort opened in 2008 but has struggled financially ever since. In 2013, the $60 million resort was the recipient of a $33 million state bailout, and after the resort’s initial operator quit the project, DAS hired Achieva to take over management beginning in 2023.
Achieva also ran into trouble, reporting very thin profit margins and ongoing issues with maintenance and infrastructure. According to testimony presented at a Nov. 26, 2025, hearing, the Hendersons invested $1 million of their own money in the resort but did not personally take any money from the company.
Hearing testimony indicated the Hendersons were particularly concerned with the resort’s onsite water park, which reportedly accounted for a half-million dollars in losses annually. The water park suffered regular breakdowns and there was testimony that its rusty water slide, which reportedly led to minor injuries, had become known as “the butt cutter.”
Contentious Zoom call triggers state action
On Oct. 21, 2025, the Hendersons had a Zoom conference call with Mark Campbell, the new director of DAS, and Nathan Reckman, the general counsel and deputy director of DAS.
During that call, which was recorded, Campbell told the Hendersons he had scheduled a company to inspect the water park to see what it would take to rehabilitate it. By all accounts, this angered the Hendersons, who repeatedly stated that no one from the state was listening to their concerns or supporting their proposal to eliminate the water park.
According to Farrell’s ruling, the Hendersons told Campbell repeatedly that if DAS was going to insist on keeping the water park, Achieva would simply shut down the resort.
After the call, DAS contacted the attorney general’s office to initiate plans to terminate the state’s contract with Achieva. On Oct. 29, 2025, eight days after the Zoom call, Campbell called the Hendersons and informed them DAS was terminating their contract, indicating the move was prompted by the Hendersons stating they intended to close the resort and send employees home.
The Hendersons objected, noting the resort was still open and that no efforts had been undertaken to close it, with special events still being planned promoted through the end of the year.
Within hours, DAS officials were at the resort with deputies from the Appanoose County Sheriff’s Office, shutting down operations and erecting concrete barricades to block entry to the property even as golfers were playing rounds nearby.
In November, the Hendersons sued, arguing the state’s actions were unjustified and left Achieva susceptible to irreparable damages. The state argued it did not nothing wrong and that switching operators at the resort was in the public’s best interest.
Judge: DAS’ actions cost 50 people their jobs
In his ruling, Farrell concluded that the evidence shows there was only one true basis for the state’s decision to end its contract with the Hendersons: the Oct. 21 video call in which the Hendersons threatened to shut down the resort. Although DAS cited other contributing factors, such as deficiencies with insurance and financial reports, DAS was aware of those issues “for months and even years” prior to the shutdown and had not given Achieva the opportunity to address them, Farrell stated.
“It is true that the Hendersons’ conduct during the call with Campbell and Reckman went off the rails,” Farrell noted in his ruling. “They very well could have avoided this litigation by keeping their cool and rationally discussing their points with Campbell, who was new to the position, and with Reckman, who was new to working with them. They did not do so. They repeatedly threatened to shut down the resort during the conversation. The state decided to take their words at face value and hold it against them.”
Even so, Farrell ruled, the contract between Achieva and DAS allows for immediate termination without notice only in situations where Achieva terminates or suspends its business.
As of Oct. 29, Achieva was clearly operating the resort, with golfers on the golf course, guests staying at the lodge, and employees working on the property, Farrell stated. Achieva was also booking reservations and had outings planned over Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, Farrell noted.
Despite this, Farrell said, DAS officials went to the resort, told guests they had to leave the next morning, closed the golf course and escorted employees off the grounds. “The state proceeded to shut down the resort with actual knowledge that Achieva had not suspended or terminated its operations,” Farrell stated.
Based on all of that, the judge said, Achieva “has a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that immediate termination (of the contract) was not justified.”
In deciding to issue the injunction Achieva requested, Farrell stated “the resort would have remained open but for the state’s actions, so the state is not in a position to complain about the current lack of revenue or the time it would take Achieva to reopen the resort” should an injunction be issued.
Farrell also concluded “there is a public interest that favors Achieva,” pointing out that DAS’ actions had resulted in 50 people losing their jobs.
“If DAS had chosen to give notice of alleged contract breaches with the 60-day right to cure, those employees may have had notice that they might lose their jobs,” Farrell stated. “That would have allowed them the opportunity to seek out other options while the cure process took place. The state’s action to shut down the business without notice and remove employees who had no blame in the dispute did not serve the public interest.”
In his ruling, Farrell said there were alternatives to DAS shutting down the resort with no notice, such as having Department of Natural Resources employees check on the resort to see if Achieva had made any real efforts to close down the business. “The state instead bullied forward with immediate termination, which caused the closure of the resort and the job loss for its employees,” Farrell stated in his ruling.

The register of its burial was signed by the Governor, the House and the Senate. Old Budget was as dead as a doornail.
I didn’t much care. I sat in my house clutching a state-sealed dividend check. Outside, voices cried for school funding, for roads, for ferries. “Bah,” I muttered, endorsing my check. “Humbug. Let them cut elsewhere. This is my money.”
The clock struck one. A knock at the door. A figure stood in the cold night — like a child, yet ancient — dressed in overalls and a white woolen coat, frost clinging to its collar.
“Rise and walk with me,” the spirit commanded.
The walls of my home dissolved. We stood on a vast, frozen tundra beside a solitary drilling rig. “Christmas 1967,” the spirit whispered. “Watch.” The drill bit spun deeper into the earth. “They’ll find it soon. You’ll be rich. But remember — you started with nothing.”
Warmth now, years later. A wood-paneled room. Jay Hammond turns, facing me: “The dividend makes us aware that what’s in the lockbox is our money! This is a share of what our money earns!”
The ghost’s face darkened. “They created it to protect the future. Now you sacrifice the future to protect the check. How quickly you forget — it was a means to an end, not the end itself.”
“But it is my money!” I argued.
The spirit vanished, replaced by a jovial giant, robed in furs seated upon a throne of sixty bickering shadows. 
“Come in and know me better, man!” he roared, leading me to a crumbling school. Inside: thirty-five children, one exhausted teacher, not enough desks, too many leaks from melting snow. Drip. Drip. Drip.
I approached a sullen boy crouched in back. “I know him! Timothy, from my cul-de-sac. What’s wrong with him?”
“There is nothing for him here. No art, no science, no instruction, no hope — why should he bother?”
I fingered the check in my pocket. “But surely he’ll be fine? They have enough!”
He opened his robe, revealing two wretched figures clinging to his legs. “This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see written Doom.”
“Have they no refuge?” I cried.
“Are there no charter schools?” the Spirit mocked, throwing my words back. “Are there no correspondence allotments?” He bellowed and slouched back into his throne. “You have one final visitor.” He pointed to a distant figure.
The third phantom approached slowly, gravely, silently; it was shrouded in deep black.
We stood in an auditorium bulging with its mass of children. Timothy sat lost among them. In front, a screen broadcasted a distant teacher. No attention was paid.
“This is insanity!” I cried.
The phantom said nothing, leading me to a hotel lobby, where tourists gathered.
“So, Alaska finally folded?” asked one, scrolling his phone.
“Completely,” another shrugged. “Couldn’t fund the basics. Everyone who could leave, left.”
“What about that dividend they were so proud of?”
“Oh, they kept it. But between federal income taxes and the sales tax, most of it evaporates anyway.”
“At least they stuck to their principles,” the first one smirked.
The Spirit pointed toward a headstone: Here Lies the Last Frontier.
I woke. My bedpost. My room. My check still in my pocket.
I threw open my window and called to a passerby. “Boy! What day is this?”
“Why, it’s Christmas Day, sir!”
“I haven’t missed it!” The choice was still mine. The legislative session hadn’t yet begun.
The spirits had shown me the path we’re on. We still have time to choose another.

Dear Reader,
VTDigger relies on reader support to fund the nonprofit reporting Vermonters depend on. As we close out 2025, we’re working to reach our year-end goal by New Year’s Eve.
Right now, your gift in any amount up to $500 will be tripled by a group of generous Vermont donors. 

3X your gift

Our year end member drive is our most important source of revenue for the year ahead. If you value VTDigger’s reporting, especially our policy and politics coverage, this is the time to chip in.
As VTDigger’s Statehouse reporter, I track the legislation that shapes daily life in Vermont. This includes the development of the state budget, new tax proposals, energy regulations and housing reforms. These issues are complex, they move quickly and they affect people’s lives directly.
Without independent political reporting, Vermonters would have fewer facts, less context and a weaker understanding of how government decisions actually happen. Without this kind of accountability journalism, powerful interests are able to operate in the shadows.
Your support helps my colleagues and me shine a light on government and the issues that matter most. If you can, please consider making a gift that will be tripled to help sustain a free and independent press in Vermont. 
The member drive — and the triple match challenge — end at midnight on December 31. Will you help us make the most of this opportunity?

Triple your impact

Thank you for supporting the work that keeps Vermont informed.
Sincerely,

Shaun Robinson

Earlier this year, the Utah Legislature passed a new law, HB403, that directed the the state’s Department of Workforce Services to request a waiver from the federal government allowing the state to enact restrictions on Utahns’ benefits received from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the U.S.’s largest food assistance program. 
In June, federal officials in President Donald Trump’s administration approved Utah’s waiver — along with applications from Idaho and Arkansas — making them the latest states to ban certain foods from being purchased with SNAP benefits as part of “Make America Healthy Again” efforts.
Utah SNAP ban on soda gets green light, along with ‘MAHA’ waivers for Idaho, Arkansas

The Utah Department of Workforce Services issued a news release Monday notifying Utah’s SNAP restrictions will take effect Thursday.
“This is not a change to the amount of SNAP benefits eligible individuals receive,” Becky Wickstrom, the department’s spokesperson, said in a prepared statement. “It is a change to what the benefits can purchase. We have worked closely with the state’s retailers to prepare for this change and are ready for it to take place on January 1, 2026.”
The Utah ban defines soda or “soft drinks” as flavored drinks that have carbonated water and are sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners. The ban doesn’t apply to milk or drinks made with milk substitutes, according to the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Drinks that are more than half real fruit or vegetable juice are also still allowed to be purchased with SNAP assistance.
Along with soda, other items ineligible for SNAP include hot, prepared foods, alcohol, tobacco products and non-food items, like cleaning supplies and pet food. 
Highland Republican Rep. Kristen Chevrier, who sponsored the bill submitting Utah’s waiver, said in a prepared statement that the change is meant to improve the SNAP program and the  “overall health outlook in the state of Utah.”
“The SNAP program helps those who are facing food insecurity and in need of nutrition,” Chevrier said. “We don’t want to undermine health and fuel chronic disease by subsidizing the purchase of sugary drinks.”
A ‘MAHA’ bill is making its way through the Utah Legislature

An earlier version of the Utah bill would have also blocked candy purchases, but that was ultimately stricken from the legislation before the state’s Republican supermajority voted along party lines to approve it.
While the bill was still under consideration, Utah House Democrats said they worried the rule would undermine SNAP recipients’ autonomy and dignity while not effectively changing dietary habits. 
“While this bill claims to promote healthier choices, it imposes restrictions without offering constructive or evidence-based solutions,” House Democrats said in a statement in February. “Additionally, this legislation will be complicated to implement — requiring costly updates to point-of-sale systems, staff retraining, and compliance monitoring, all without guaranteeing better health outcomes.”

BARNARD — U.S.-China trade relations have been roiled this year by a tariff fight, and agriculture is one of the sectors of the economy that was thrown into disarray.
But revenue from agricultural exports to China has boomed this year in Vermont. In the first eight months of 2025, the value of Vermont’s exports have increased by 78.3% compared with the same time frame in 2024, according to a report from Farm Flavor, an agriculture company based in Franklin, Tenn.
But this doesn’t mean Green Mountain maple syrup and CSA shares are be shipped to Beijing.
Almost all of the $2.7 million increase came from dairy products, more specifically whey, according to Farm Flavor content director Hannah Hill. Whey is a byproduct of cheese used for protein powder, baby formula, as a food-additive and in animal feed.
And Vermont is “on track to break all records for whey exports to China of anything in the last five years,” said Brendan Wilson, the CEO of Food Export Northeast, a Chicago-based nonprofit trade association.
On average, agricultural exports to China from the United States have fallen 54% compared to last year, according to Farm Flavor’s report.
Vermont is bucking that trend.
The largest Vermont exporter of whey to China is Agri-Mark, the largest dairy co-op in Vermont and owner of Cabot Cheese, said Scott Waterman, a spokesman for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food, and Markets.
The 78.3% increase could be attributed to increased whey prices in the international market, rather than an actual increase of product being shipped.

While income from total U.S. dairy exports to China fell by 2% in 2025, Vermont’s income on agricultural exports to China increased by 78.3%, according to USDA data analyzed in a report by agricultural media organization Farm Flavor. The increase is due in large part to higher prices for whey, a byproduct of cheese making. Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley News

“A lot of the number of fluctuations around value are based on the value of the commodity, not necessarily the export volume,” Waterman said.
The increased revenue isn’t through any particular concerted effort as the co-op hasn’t been aiming to increase its whey production, said Paul Doton, a Barnard dairy farmer who also serves on the board of Agri-Mark.
The state’s small scale relative to the market means that price changes can make a big difference, percentage-wise.
“The amount of actual pounds of product in Vermont are minuscule compared to the rest of the country,” Doton said.
Smaller dairy farmers who are more focused on the price of milk still can benefit from the increase, even if indirectly.
“We want (the large milk companies) to be profitable so they keep buying our milk,” said Keith Sprague, co-owner of the 800 Holsteins at Sprague Farm in Brookfield. “So whatever they can do to get rid of a byproduct and get their profit up is good by me.”
Vermont makes up just about 3% of the country’s whey exports, Wilson said. The nonprofit he oversees has 12 “members” that are state departments of agriculture, including those of Vermont and New Hampshire.
The average price of dry whey has increased from $0.322 per pound at the beginning of 2024 to $0.558 at the beginning of this year. Vermont’s export revenue from whey has fluctuated over the past few years, increasing especially this year. This is largely due to changing prices in whey, Wilson said.
In 2022, Vermont’s whey exports to China were $3.6 million, the next year $2.1 million, and in 2024 were $3.6 million. Through just the first nine months of this year, Vermont has exported $4.8 million worth of whey to China.

(Map made by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix via DataWrapper)More than $209 million in federal funding is headed Florida’s way to bolster health care in rural communities.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the first-year grant awards in a press release Monday. The awards are part of the the Rural Health Transformation Program, a $50 billion initiative in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act intended to modernize health care in these communities. The CMS release notes that grants were approved for every state.
At $209 million, Florida ranks just above the average grant award of $200 million, according to the press release. Grants ranged from a low of $147 million (New Jersey) to a high of $281 million (Texas).

“More than 60 million Americans living in rural areas have the right to equal access to quality care,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a written statement.
“This historic investment puts local hospitals, clinics, and health workers in control of their communities’ healthcare. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, rural Americans will now have affordable healthcare close to home, free from bureaucratic obstacles.”
The Trump law cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid over the next decade. To help offset those reductions, Congress included in the bill a $50 billion, five-year initiative to help fund rural programs. The law requires distribution of half of the money equally among states that submit applications for the program.
The remaining money is allocated based on a state’s “rural profile.”
There are 67 counties in Florida; 31 are considered “rural” under Florida law. The 2020 Census put Florida’s rural population at 1,183,017 people.
Florida Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris said last month that the state hoped for “maximum funding” and to make grant applications available on the agency’s website in January or February.
“We’ll have to get budget authority through the Legislature to be able to tap into any funding that we’re awarded, but we’ll put out those requests for applications,” Harris said during a National Rural Health Day event in Lake City.
A CMS document summarizing states’ grant applications shows Florida’s is dubbed ” Making Rural Florida Healthy Again.”
The Florida plan has five stated goals, to quote the CMS document:

Improve Access: Combine urban-led rural clinics, mobile health, community paramedicine, tele-specialties, remote monitoring, retail pharmacy clinics, and nutrition focused Health and Lifestyle initiatives to offer preventive, chronic disease, behavioral health, and maternal care directly to residents.
Improve Outcomes: Reduce preventable hospitalizations and improve chronic, behavioral, and maternal health outcomes through evidence-based, technology-enabled interventions.
Enhance Technology and Data Use: Advance telehealth, remote monitoring, and health information exchange and encounter notification systems to improve continuity, efficiency, and performance tracking.
Strengthen Workforce: Build a lasting rural workforce pipeline through the Clinical Training Investment Opportunity (CTIO) initiative, with supervised rotations and five-year rural service commitments.
Ensure Financial Sustainability: Implement value-based payment models and promote (an) integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans initiative to stabilize rural hospitals and strengthen provider solvency through more streamlined billing for providers.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/uAsoU-florida-rural-counties-2-1024x651.png,,,2025-12-29 15:57:19.965995

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Landowners opposed to a carbon sequestration project in Iowa have asked a state court to reconsider its decision to pause a lawsuit over the permit for the pipeline until state officials rule on a filed amendment. 
Landowners argue the Polk County District Court’s decision to send the permit back to Iowa Utilities Commission “relied heavily” on the existence of a South Dakota law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. 
Landowners, counties and the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter filed a suit in 2024 against the Iowa Utilities Commission decision to grant a permit to Summit Carbon Solutions for the first phase of its proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. The permit stated the Iowa-based company could not begin construction on the pipeline to connect to biorefineries and transport carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota, until it had secured permits from the Dakotas.

In the spring of 2025, however, South Dakota enacted a law that prohibited the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. Eminent domain is used to force unwilling landowners to allow the use of their property for projects considered in the public interest, at a price set by a county commission. South Dakota’s law meant Summit would have to obtain 100% of necessary land easements through voluntary contracts. 
Summit filed for an amendment to its permit in September with the IUC to replace the Dakotas-specific language and instead require that the company receive permits for adequate sequestration and storage sites, not in a specific location. 
The company then requested the court pause proceedings on the case against the permit until the IUC ruled on the proposed amendments. After oral arguments on the request in October, the Iowa District Court for Polk County remanded the permit to the IUC and paused judicial proceedings until the commission decided on the proposed amendments. 
The changes in South Dakota, which occurred after the IUC issued the initial permit, were influential to the court’s decision. 
Pipeline issue to be discussed early in 2026 legislative session, GOP leader says

Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie referred to the law as the “S.D. CO2 Pipeline Ban” in the decision and said it “render the IUC’s Final Order void” and would require Summit to find a route outside of South Dakota to get to its planned underground storage site in North Dakota. 
Landowners requesting the reconsideration of the case said the South Dakota law is “not a ban” on carbon dioxide pipelines in the state and that the law should not be a “relevant or material factor” in the case as Summit could still pass through South Dakota under the law. 
“(The South Dakota law) is not a ban on Summit’s project in South Dakota and is not a ban on the citing and construction of carbon oxide pipelines in, through, or across South Dakota, that change in law is not material to the IUC’s South Dakota condition,” the motion for reconsideration said. 
The motion from landowners argues that because Summit has not stated that it no longer plans to route the pipeline through South Dakota, the remand to the IUC gives the company a “second bite at the apple” and a “business flexibility” which leaves affected landowners “in the lurch.” 
“Summit wants the South Dakota condition removed while still maintaining the right to send Iowa carbon dioxide through South Dakota,” the motion said. “… unless Summit presented evidence to this court renouncing any South Dakota route through which Iowa generated CO2 would travel via its pipeline, the logic for the IUC condition remains and remand is not necessary because Summit can and may go through South Dakota.”
Representation for Summit argued before the court that it made “little sense” to proceed with the case if the permit were to be amended at the IUC level. 
Judge Beattie also noted that staying the case until the IUC decided on the permit amendment would also prevent the case from potentially being litigated a second time. Beattie wrote in the decision that “adjudicating the merits of a permit that is actively being amended serves no useful purpose.”
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.
The landowners, represented by Brian Jorde of Domina Law Group, asked the court to reverse its finding that the South Dakota law renders the IUC order void and to reverse its remand to instead set a briefing schedule for the appeal. 
If the court does not reverse its decision, the motion asks the court to “specifically identify” and direct the IUC to “rescind route approval and eminent domain approval for all portions of the Iowa route from the South Dakota border back to the nearest connecting Iowa ethanol plant” in order to avoid “pipelines to nowhere.”

The former executive director of the Central Vermont Economic Development Corporation has been charged with embezzling more than $70,000 from the organization. 
Melissa Bounty, 42, of Waitsfield, is expected to appear in Washington County Superior criminal court on Jan. 15 for an arraignment on the felony charge, according to a Saturday press release from the Montpelier Police Department.
The charge against Bounty stemmed from a lengthy investigation that began in July, when the department received a report from the organization stating that Bounty, its executive director at the time, had “utilized company funds for personal gain,” according to the release.

The investigation, according to the press release, found that Bounty had embezzled $71,151 from the organization during her tenure as executive director from 2022 to 2025.
Police said they would not disclose any additional information regarding the charges. More 
information about the investigation is expected to become available following Bounty’s court arraignment when the police affidavit filed in support of the charge becomes public. 
A person who answered the phone at a number for Bounty in Waitsfield said she didn’t want to talk about the matter. Officials with the organization could not be reached Monday for comment. 
VTDigger had reported in July that Bounty had been placed on leave from her job with the organization pending an investigation, though details about the nature of that probe were not made public. 
The nonprofit organization is one of 12 regional development corporations across the state. The groups receive state and federal funds to help promote and support local businesses. 
At that time, Bounty said in a statement to VTDigger that she stood “by my work and my integrity,” adding, “I care so deeply for the Central Vermont business community and have been honored to learn more about the wonderful work happening in this vibrant region every day.”

He is shown speaking to reporters during a Jan. 23, 2024, news conference. (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s budget faces a fiscal cliff by mid-2028 when accumulated surpluses will be depleted, state Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick said in a report released Monday analyzing spending trends since 2000.
The report, following soon after revenue projections estimating general revenue will be $400 million less than expected, warns that a recession could deplete the surplus even faster, by the end of fiscal 2027.
“The time is now to make the tough decisions that will prevent drastic, emergency budget cuts from being necessary in the months and years ahead,” Fitzpatrick said in a news release. 
Fitzpatrick, the auditor since 2023, was previously chairman of the House Budget Committee. When he was a lawmaker, from 2013 to 2019, state revenues were tight and often subject to large cuts when growth was sluggish.
Few current legislators have experienced shrinking budgets, Fitzpatrick said.
“Many current legislators have only been in office during these last few years during which strong economic growth and a huge influx of federal money have made hard budget decisions unnecessary,” Fitzpatrick said. “But they’re about to face the challenge of crafting a budget in the face of slowing revenue growth and reduced federal funding.“
Missouri faces budget crunch as capital gains tax cut hits harder than expected 

Gov. Mike Kehoe on Jan. 13 will deliver his budget proposal for fiscal 2027. When he released the reduced revenue estimate on Dec. 17, Kehoe warned of a tight budget coming and a need to limit new spending.
There will be upward pressure on the general revenue fund from changes to shared federal programs and spending from soon-to-be-depleted funds that substitute for general revenue. At the same time, the estimate shows, there will be downward pressure on revenues due to the bill eliminating the state income tax on capital gains pushed through by Republicans in Missouri and changes to the federal tax code pushed through by Republicans in Congress.
The budget for fiscal 2026, which ends on June 30, projects general revenue spending on state operations at $15 billion, with another $725 million appropriated for building projects. General revenue receipts for the year should be about $13.15 billion, a decline of 2.1% over fiscal 2025, according to the estimate released Dec. 17.
If the estimate is correct, it would be the fourth consecutive year when state revenues lag behind inflation and the first time revenues have declined year-over-year outside of a recession or COVID-impacted fiscal 2020.
Previous estimates had projected revenue growth for the year.
The Dec. 17 estimate forecasts growing revenues in the coming budget year, and Fitzpatrick used the 25-year average of year-over-year growth to project further.
Fitzpatrick said if lawmakers add nothing to the current budget for three years, and the revenue estimate is accurate, the general revenue fund balance, which reached a record $5.8 billion on June 30, 2023, will be depleted before fiscal 2028 ends on June 30, 2028.
The general revenue fund balance was $3.4 billion at the end of November. The state will be about $370 million short in fiscal 2028, Fitzpatrick’s report projects.
If a recession hits and Missouri experiences a repetition of the worst decline this century, Fitzpatrick said, the balance will be depleted as much as a year earlier. The gap between revenue and spending could reach $3.8 billion, the report states.
“Economic trends are unpredictable and we need to make sure Missouri is ready to face any challenge,” he said.
Spending has exceeded revenues in each year since fiscal 2023, with the surplus providing the difference. The surplus was accumulated by replacing state funds with federal COVID-19 pandemic aid and year-over-year revenue windfalls due to inflation and rapid wage growth.
In a statement issued Monday afternoon, House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, said Fitzpatrick’s projection is not surprising.
“His analysis confirms what I have said both in private and public comments over the past year about the long-term condition of the state budget,” Deaton said. “Specifically, the concern about a structural deficit created when ongoing general revenue spending exceeds what the state collects within a given fiscal year.”
Keeping spending flat into future years will be difficult. This year’s state budget includes about $1.2 billion in spending from non-general revenue funds that will be depleted at the end of the fiscal year. Department budget requests have identified about $1 billion in spending in just a handful of large items that must come from general revenue for programs to continue at their current level.
“There are certainly significant mandatory increases that we’re going to have to deal with,” state Budget Director Dan Haug said in an interview with The Independent earlier this month.
Fitzpatrick’s report notes that Missouri has a budget reserve fund holding about $900 million but that it cannot be used to cover shortfalls except in an emergency.
The report does not address whether other funds, holding about $2.5 billion for major projects, should be recaptured for general revenue. It also does not estimate the potential impact of future tax cuts in law and being proposed.
Ongoing expenses have increased for public education, increased payments to medical and mental health providers and state employee payrolls. The budget has also been increased by lawmakers sprinkling hundreds of millions in earmarked projects into spending bills to fund local needs or help favored organizations. 
State lawmakers asked by The Independent about the budget said they expect cuts in a number of programs when Kehoe presents his plan.
State Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton on the House Budget Committee, said decreasing revenues will force spending reductions.
“I think every single department across the state, every single area, needs to be looked at so that Missouri can not have a crisis on its hands.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Republicans are facing the impact of policies that put tax cuts ahead of state obligations.
The capital gains tax cut will reduce revenue by $500 million but Republicans, when it passed, insisted it was closer to $110 million annually.
“I do not understand how they think outcomes in this state will change when they continue to blow holes in our budget through things like the elimination of the capital gains tax,” Fogle said.
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, echoed Fogle’s criticism of GOP tax policies. Additional costly tax cuts for top earners are already in state law, she said.
“Because of the decisions of Republican politicians to give tax cuts to the most wealthy, fundamental state services are going to suffer,” Nurrenbern said.
Reducing ongoing programs now will protect future budgets from cuts, Fitzpatrick said in the news release.
“The longer Missouri waits to take action,” Fitzpatrick said, “the harder this exercise will become.”

The allocation of the funds, which has to be formally approved by the Legislature in a special session scheduled to begin on Jan. 21, will focus on four areas: Workforce, preventive care and healthy eating, bringing high-quality health care closer to North Dakotans and connecting technology and data with medical providers. 
“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rethink and reshape how health care is delivered to our rural communities,” Armstrong said in a news release.
The Legislature will have limited opportunity to make any changes to how the funds will be used. North Dakota Health and Human Services submitted an application earlier this fall for the state’s share of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, with legislative input, and the state is expected to adhere to the funding plan laid out in the application. 
Health and Human Services is working to establish a framework for the distribution, prioritization and compliance monitoring of the grant funding in the lead up to the special session. The department expects to announce the first grant opportunities using the funds in the first three months of 2026. 
“Being awarded this grant funding is an important milestone,” Sarah Aker, medical services executive director for Health and Human Services, said in a news release. “Now, our focus shifts to implementation so the resources can start making an impact in rural communities.”
The $199 million award from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is for fiscal year 2026. Additional funding will be announced on an annual basis for the remaining four years of the program. Each state is eligible for a minimum of $500 million, but could receive up to $1 billion, over the five years. 
“This funding allows North Dakota to build on existing partnerships and invest in long-term solutions to move toward making our state the healthiest in the nation,” Pat Traynor, commissioner for North Dakota Health and Human Services, said in a news release. 
North Dakota received a similar amount to its neighbors: Minnesota was awarded $193 million, $189 million went to South Dakota and Montana received $233 million. 
New Jersey received the smallest award, at $147 million, while Texas was awarded the highest amount, $281 million.

Faughn, whose company currently publishes an online compendium of press releases and opinion pieces called the Missouri Times, said in a press release that all three newspapers will continue to operate under their current names and locations. Employees, he said, will remain in their current positions.
“We are honored to carry forward the legacy of the News Tribune, Fulton Sun and California Democrat,” Faughn said. “Our goal is to maintain the high level of service readers expect while investing in the long-term success of these publications.”
Walter Hussman Jr., publisher and chairman of WEHCO Media, said at a press conference Monday that the papers have not been profitable since his company purchased them. He called community journalism a “public trust,” adding that he is hopeful that under local ownership the papers will thrive. 
Faughn has been involved in politics since a young age. He became mayor of Poplar Bluff at the age of 22 in 2002. 
He then led the Poplar Bluff Chamber of Commerce and was a catalyst behind a successful effort to widen a local highway. But he was convicted in 2007 of three felony counts for forging checks from an account related to that effort.
He started the Missouri Times in 2012 along with former Missouri House Speaker Rod Jetton, who is no longer involved with the company. 
His first brush with controversy in state politics came in 2015, when it was revealed he was hosting parties for lawmakers in Jefferson City that were paid for by lobbyists. The arrangement nearly got the Missouri Times booted from the Capitol Press Association, as it was widely seen as a strategy to help lawmakers avoiding disclosure of lobbyist gifts. 
In early 2018, Faughn paid $120,000 in cash in several installments to a St. Louis attorney who was representing the ex-husband of the woman who accused then-Gov. Eric Greitens of coercive and violent sexual misconduct.
Shortly after the first payment, St. Louis television station KMOV broadcast a recording provided by the ex-husband of his former wife detailing how Greitens allegedly tied her up, stripped off her clothes, photographed her naked without her consent and threatened to release the image if she told anyone about their affair.
The recording was made without the woman’s knowledge and publicized without her consent.
Faughn kept the payments secret for months while continuing to cover Greitens both in his newspaper and on his TV show. When the payments were eventually revealed during a court proceeding, Faughn fled the state to avoid a subpoena from Greitens’ lawyers.
When he was eventually called to testify before the House investigative committee, Faughn said under oath that the money was for the purchase of recordings of Greitens’ alleged victim talking about physical abuse for a book he was working on — even though other journalists got the recordings for free.
Lawmakers publicly questioned his explanation, especially after the attorney whom he paid testified that Faughn told him the money came from an unnamed wealthy Republican who did not like Greitens. 
One Republican called Faughn’s testimony “mind boggling.” 
The Missouri Times was officially kicked out of the press association soon after. 
Since then, questions about the editorial independence of Faughn’s news operations have continued to swirl.
Ironically, the Jefferson City News Tribune was one of the organizations that most loudly denounced Faughn after his involvement in the Greitens scandals were revealed. 
“When a ‘journalist’ is more interested in being involved in a big news event than simply reporting on it,” the paper argued, “he no longer should be considered a journalist.” 
Faughn’s history did not come up at Monday’s press conference. 
Hussman urged readers and the business community to rally around Faughn, who he said shares his “commitment to customers, employees and the community.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)The Kentucky Blood Center is reporting a “significant strain” on its blood supply following the holiday season. 
The organization is asking for people, especially those with O type or A- blood, to donate this week “to boost the source of lifesaving blood products for more than 70 hospitals in Kentucky.” 
According to a Monday news release, Kentucky Blood Center has “less than a half day’s supply” of both O- and O+ blood, putting that supply in “critical shape.” 
The anatomy of Kentucky’s blood supply, and why more need to donate

The O-negative supply is crucial because this is the universal type and can go to anyone. This blood type is often used in emergencies when a patient’s blood type isn’t known. According to the American Red Cross, just 7% of Americans have an O-negative blood type. 
The center also has less than a half day’s supply of A- blood. 
“Higher donor turnout over the remaining few days of 2025 is crucial to providing a healthy blood supply for local patients in need,” the organization said. 
Depending on location and time of donation, blood centers and mobile drives are giving away movie tickets and hoodies in exchange for blood donations.

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk Southern)If America is a breathing vessel, railroads are surely the veins.
For over a century, rail has acted as the delivery system for our country’s economy, transforming industries, unlocking new markets, and benefiting folks at every step of the supply chain.
It’s cost-efficient, built for long distances at large volume, and safe.
Generations before us have witnessed this themselves as Spartanburg’s rail infrastructure grew rapidly in the late 19th century.
With rail, our region’s peach and textile industries thrived. Thousands of high-paying jobs were created both in and around railroads, making Spartanburg a pivotal rail connector and giving it the moniker “Hub City.”
As highways began to dominate both passenger and freight transportation, rail saw a decline at the end of the 20th century.
But the industry is resurging. Developments like the inland port at Greer – which recently expanded to meet higher freight demand — have strengthened our region’s position as a logistics hub linking Port Charleston to the rest of the country.
These advances are key reasons South Carolina now moves tens of millions of tons in endpoint rail freight every year.
This year has the potential to bring even more transformational change.
Two major rail operators — Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific — are seeking approval for an end-to-end merger that would give America its first transcontinental line without creating redundancies.
The combination would grow domestic manufacturing by limiting costly line-transfer delays and increasing quality control on long-range freight.
It also stands to ease the burden on worn-out state roads by increasing the amount of freight viable by rail, a benefit all South Carolinians will feel in their wallets and in the time they don’t spend stuck in traffic.
The operational advantages provided by this merger are significant, and fully aligned with the transportation priorities I championed as a councilman for Spartanburg County and continue to support as a member of this community.
Should the proposed Norfolk Southern–Union Pacific merger move forward, the decision will rest not with the companies themselves, but with federal regulators.
Any end-to-end rail merger of this scale must be reviewed by the Surface Transportation Board, an independent, bipartisan agency in Washington, D.C., tasked by Congress with evaluating major rail transactions.
The board is responsible for determining whether a merger serves the public interest — examining impacts on competition, service, safety, infrastructure, and the broader economy through a review process that includes public input and economic analysis.
The merger would strengthen manufacturing by opening new markets for both inputs and finished products.
Companies relying on chemical compounds like ethylene— used to make petrochemicals and other finished plastics — such as BMW’s Spartanburg plant and Michelin’s Upstate facilities, would gain improved access to Union Pacific’s network in the Gulf Coast, where states hold a structural advantage.
Other essential manufacturing materials, like soda ash (a key ingredient used in glass production and other products), could become more affordable as the new line improves access to high-production states like Wyoming.
Manufacturing accounts for 14% of statewide employment and generates tens of billions in output, making its continued growth vital to South Carolina’s economy.
Industrial chemicals imported to our state leave as finished products, often categorized as miscellaneous mixed shipments.
These are already two of the highest volume products transported by rail in and out of our state — and the top rail-freight commodities by value.
The merger would expand our state’s access to these valuable materials and gives our manufacturers greater ability to deliver high-value finished products by rail to any part of the country.
As coal demand declines and coal-fired plants close nationwide, the industries that depend on freight rail — and stand to benefit from this merger — will only become more important.
Beyond the private sector, our public roads and bridges would gain longevity and safety.
We’re all familiar with the poor condition of our roadways.
The more we rely on trucking, the faster our infrastructure deteriorates; because of their weight, heavy trucks cause the majority of structural damage and are involved in a disproportionate share of fatal accidents.
In 2022 alone, it would have taken 3.3 million trucks to move the freight in South Carolina handled by rail.
This isn’t to say trucking isn’t essential to our economy — it is — but as this merger makes rail a stronger competitor, we stand to gain longer-lasting roads, less congestion, cleaner air, and real savings for taxpayers.
At the end of the day, this merger doesn’t raise taxes, divert public funds, or burden local budgets.
It equips South Carolina with better tools: stronger freight capacity, safer and more durable roads, and a manufacturing sector with room to expand.
That’s why I support it.
The merger helps our people, our economy, and our infrastructure — without costing taxpayers a dime.
That’s the kind of progress we should get behind.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/norfolk-southern-train-scaled-e1752779568626-1024x788.jpg,,,2025-12-29 13:57:19.123093

Dr. Robert Wolf of Johnson is charged by the Iowa Dental Board with practicing dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public; willful and gross neglect; failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency; practicing beyond one’s training; employing or permitting an unlicensed or unregistered to practice dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting, and encouraging, assisting, or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting.
The board has not disclosed any information as to the alleged underlying conduct that gave rise to the charges except to say that Wolf was practicing somewhere in Iowa at the time the alleged violations took place. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Jan. 23, 2026.
State records show that in November 2024, the board scheduled a hearing to discuss its intent to refuse Wolf’s request that he be given a permit to use moderate sedation on patients.
In the written notice of its intent to deny the permit — which the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing mistakenly published to the board’s website before removing it — the board alleged Wolf had participated in a surgical procedure in which the patient later died, and that he had done so without having the required permit to use sedation.
In the notice, the board also alleged Wolf had participated in the operation “with an individual who was not licensed to practice dentistry” and that Wolf “facilitated the practice of an unlicensed dentist, and supervised the administration of anesthesia without having the proper credentials.”
Board records show that before the scheduled hearing on the permit denial, Wolf rescinded his request for a permit, and the hearing was canceled.
Court records shed light on case
Court records indicate the board’s concerns were focused on the treatment received by 50-year-old Joseph Daniels, who died in January 2024 shortly after dental implant surgery at Dental Studio of Iowa in Johnston.
Daniels’ family has filed a civil lawsuit against Wolf, Dr. Jonathan Karch, and others involved in the operation. That lawsuit alleges that on Jan. 26, 2024, the implant procedure began at 7:15 a.m. and was completed at 3:15 p.m., with patient care allegedly turned over to certified registered nurse anesthetist Nicky Newhoff, who was tasked with waking Daniels and initiating the recovery process.
The lawsuit alleges that at 3:30 p.m., a dental assistant notified Karch and Wolf they were needed in the surgical suite through a message that stated, “Joe is not doing well — please come immediately.”
According to EMS medical records, paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa at 3:35 p.m. with a report of an “unconscious person.” According to the lawsuit, the paramedics arrived at 3:40 p.m. and found Daniels in a dental exam chair “pale, cyanotic, cool and unresponsive.” Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died at 5:51 p.m.
The lawsuit alleges that during the operation, Karch “allowed Wolf to perform extractions and place implants into Daniels’ mouth knowing that Wolf lacked the informed consent of Daniels to perform such procedures.” It also alleges that Wolf allowed Marko Kamel, an individual who was not licensed to practice dentistry in Iowa, to participate in the surgery.
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for negligence, is still pending. All of the defendants in the case, including Karch, Wolf, Dental Studio of Iowa, and Wolf’s employer, Coral West Dental, have denied any wrongdoing.
The case is scheduled to be tried on Sept. 28, 2026.
Karch sanctioned by Iowa Dental Board
Earlier this year, the Iowa Dental Board entered a final order in its disciplinary case against Karch.
The order stipulated that Karch would not be issued a permit to administer patient sedation until Sept. 13, 2025, and that he pay a $7,500 civil penalty and complete some unspecified amount of additional continuing education, with some of that education related to professional ethics.
The board’s order also stated that should Karch be issued a sedation permit, it would be placed on probationary status for three years during which a practice monitor must be physically present in the treatment room for any sedation procedures handled by Karch.
According to the board’s findings of fact in the Karch case, “R.W.” — identified in other board records as Robert Wolf — was the primary surgeon for the procedure. The board alleged Wolf did not have a sedation permit at the time. Karch did have a sedation permit but, by all accounts, he was only in the operatory sporadically and spent most of the time 10 to 15 feet away in an adjacent room working on the fabrication of temporary implants.
Wolf “nevertheless proceeded with the surgery, with a certified registered nurse anesthetist contracted by The Dental Studio of Iowa to administer and monitor” the sedation, the board determined.

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley rejected the motion from Joseph Schwartz, who she’s ordered to report to an Arkansas prison by Monday afternoon to serve his state sentence on tax evasion and Medicaid fraud charges.
Schwartz had requested an extension of that order, citing concerns that the state Department of Corrections would not be able to comply with his religious dietary restrictions.
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when Trump pardoned him in November. 
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a petition earlier this month seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence.
Whatley has previously rejected Schwartz’s argument that the three months he served in federal prison made him immediately eligible for state parole.
Schwartz last week sought the delay in Whatley’s order. Schwartz’s attorneys said that, as a rabbi, he must adhere to a stricter kosher diet.
Whatley said the state had provided information that the Cummins Unit has a kosher kitchen to accommodate Schwartz’s diet.
Schwartz pleaded guilty last year in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa lawmakers are heading into the 2026 legislative session with several new leaders — but many of the issues expected to take top priority are subjects left unresolved in 2025, namely eminent domain and property taxes.
Lawmakers presented legislation on both of these issues during the 2025 legislative session, but neither became state law. Republican leaders had brought up property taxes as one of their top concerns heading into the last session, but a measure failed to reach the governor’s desk.
Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, who is now House majority leader, and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, introduced legislation in 2025 to eliminate the state’s “rollback” system for calculating property taxes, calling for a move to a “revenue-restricted” system limiting levy rate growth alongside other changes. This proposal went through multiple iterations, but failed to come to a floor vote.

While the push for action on property taxes was led by legislative leaders last year, Gov. Kim Reynolds has said she plans to introduce a proposal to lower property taxes in 2026. Over the past few months, she and other Republican leaders have held meetings with local government and community leaders across the state to discuss how to approach the subject.
The governor has warned that reducing property taxes could mean a reduction in local government services, saying in May that Iowans should not expect “level of government that we have and expect the property taxes to go lower.” However, she said there are areas where services can be consolidated or streamlined in an effort to more efficiently use taxpayer dollars.
Reynolds has also said she is considering a property tax freeze for seniors as another strategy to ease Iowans’ economic burden.
“We have to see what the numbers look like,” Reynolds told reporters in November. “We can’t shift it to the state, that’s not property tax relief … it has to be sustainable.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley said House Republicans are also focused on tackling property taxes – saying the 2025 discussions on the issue were a “good lesson” in how to best craft legislation moving forward. He said “there’s going to be pieces of … the bills from last year that are probably not going to be included” in this year’s legislation. He said the caucus wants to present a plan that favors the taxpayer over the taxing entity, and one that is simplified from previous discussions.
“It needs to give certainty to the taxpayer, and at the same time, we need to make sure it’s something that’s understandable,” Grassley said. “Because every property tax conversation we’ve had for 20 years is very difficult, very in the weeds, very hard to understand. I think that’s why we’ve been unable to really get an overall reform of the system itself.”
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said Democrats are willing to work across the aisle to address high property tax costs, and echoed the state’s property tax system needs to be simplified and more transparent. However, she said Senate Democrats want to ensure tax relief is reaching the people in the most need, and that local communities can weather the reduced income.
“It’s really essential that local communities be at the table, because we can’t risk putting public safety and other really important things for local communities at risk – and they’re the ones who have to pay the bills, they’re the ones who are now facing the results of previous mandates,” Weiner said. “… And from what I’ve heard sort of across the state, they’re really frustrated. (Those) are the people who are doing the work in every city, in every county and every township, and they deserve to have a seat at the table.”
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh says he expects to see bills on property taxes from the governor, House and Senate in 2026, and that the session will be spent discussing areas where all parties agree.
“At the end of the day, the conversation will be, ‘How deep in the weeds do we go?’” Klimesh said. “We have a 40-year-old system — do we slap Band-Aids on, right? My perspective is sometimes it’s going to take it down to the chassis and rebuild it from there. But at the end of the day, we’ll have to sit on a table and build a consensus.”
House Minority Leader Brian Meyer said House Democrats plan to roll out a property tax proposal in January, led by Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee. The legislative proposal will focus on lowering residential property taxes while “protecting schools, protecting first responders,” he said.
Consensus on eminent domain remains elusive
Another issue carrying over from 2025 is how to address the use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects.
Legislation related to pipelines was approved by the Legislature in 2025. Sending the bill to Reynolds’ desk was a contentious journey. The measure only made it to floor debate in the Senate after 12 GOP senators signed a letter saying they would not vote on spending bills and allow the session to end until a measure on eminent domain was debated.
The Senate passed the bill in a 27-22 vote, but Reynolds vetoed the measure, saying the legislation combined “valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.”
There is still a strong push from Republicans calling for state lawmakers to address the subject, specifically to address some landowners’ issues with the Summit Carbon Solutions project. But some of the same concerns from Republicans, including the governor and Senate leaders, who opposed last year’s legislation, remain in play — meaning a consensus on how to tackle the property rights issue has yet to be reached.
Klimesh said he plans to introduce legislation within the first week of session that would allow companies to seek voluntary easements within a 10-mile radius of the corridor approved by the Iowa Utilities Commission in the permit process. This proposal, Klimesh said, would allow carbon sequestration pipeline projects to move forward without having to use eminent domain to build a pipeline against a property owner’s wishes.
“I think, at the end of the day, that allows me to exercise my property rights, by denying access to my property, it allows my neighbor to exercise their property rights by entering into a voluntary easement,” he told Republicans at the Westside Conservative Club.
This proposal was one of the suggestions offered in an amendment to the 2025 legislation by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, which was not adopted during Senate debate.
This approach may differ from how Iowa House Republicans plan to tackle the subject. Grassley said House Republicans plan to introduce legislation next year focused specifically on the use of eminent domain. Under current law, property owners can be forced to allow easements on their land for projects considered in the public’s interest at a price set by a county compensation commission. Part of the dispute over carbon pipelines is whether the projects are in the public interest.
“Where I think we end up this session, whatever comes from the House, is going to be a little bit more tailored to eminent domain,” Grassley said. “I know the bill was a little bit broader than we passed over to the Senate last year, that the governor then vetoed. …The caucus, in the meantime, has recognized that that’s been where we’ve had our focus for the last several years – its been around eminent domain.”
The use of eminent domain in pipeline projects is not a party-line issue — the measures passed with both bipartisan support and opposition in both chambers in 2025.
Meyer said he does not see the proposal brought up by Klimesh on expanding the pipeline corridor as a way to put the issue to rest, saying he believes House Republicans will aim for more substantive action on eminent domain.
Meyer said he believes most Democrats understand there are competing interests in how to address the issue, as carbon capture pipelines are “an important part of the future of agriculture moving forward,” but that there are real questions on “how do we protect property rights” brought up by the projects.
Meyer said he believes there is a path forward to address this issue – but Republicans, who have held a trifecta of control at the Capitol for several years, will have to collaborate with Democrats to reach the finish line.
“We’re going to have to see where it goes,” Meyer said. “There’s a solution here. It’s just that they’re so used to not having to work with Democrats or anybody else.”
Cancer, water quality discussions expected
Legislative leaders also said they predict to field more discussions on issues related to Iowans’ health in 2026. As the state has the second-highest cancer incident rate in the country, officials have said they plan to investigate why Iowa’s cancer rates are growing while national rates lower.
Some advocates say environmental factors — and problems caused by agricultural products — are behind some of these numbers. Klimesh was questioned by a voter at the Westside Conservative Club about why lawmakers have advanced legislation in several previous sessions to shield pesticide companies from certain lawsuits — specifically, in response to numerous lawsuits launched against Bayer, the manufacturer of  RoundUp, which claim the product gave plaintiffs cancer.
Klimesh said the previous versions of the legislation did not stop people from suing companies like Bayer over claims like negligence or fraud, but over specific ““failure to warn” claims related to pesticide labels issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“At the end of the day, they did not take away your rights to sue that company for cause in any way, shape or form,” Klimesh said. “All it simply said was you can’t sue them for not meeting a requirement the federal government won’t let them meet. At the end of the day, what concerns me is, if we allow that to continue, glyphosates will come in from China. What’s the recourse then? There’s no way you’re going to sue a Chinese company, right? That’s an impossible hurdle.”
Grassley said he believes there are ” merits to wanting to make sure that these types of products are made here in this country — but not just this country, in our state.” He said while there was not enough support to move the bill forward last year, the 2026 session could be different.
“Not knowing what the future … looks like, if that’s something the caucus wants to move forward with, I think we’ll be open to that conversation,” Grassley said.
Another environmental issue that may be impacting Iowans’ health is water quality. Concerns about nitrate levels in Iowa’s waterways have heightened over the past year, as nitrate concentrations reached near record highs in Iowa rivers in 2025. Experts say data shows nitrate concentrations have increased in Iowa over the past decades.
Meyer said Iowa House Democrats plan to bring forward a legislative proposal to address high nitrate levels and increase water quality monitoring throughout the state.
While environmental advocates point to agricultural runoff as a contributor to Iowa’s growing cancer rates, some legislators have said other factors may be contributing. In November, Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Pella, said other states, like Illinois, would also be seeing similarly high cancer rates if agricultural pollution was the driving force behind the state’s cancer rates.
“Once we have apparent solutions or answers, then we can start changing policy or making policy,” Rozenboom said. “But I think most of us more have more questions than answers yet.”
Klimesh said lawmakers are also planning to continue to partner with institutions like the University of Iowa Health system, “to make sure that they’re doing research, point us in the right direction where we can be helpful with that.”
Weiner said as research is ongoing, the Legislature should focus on finding ways to “deal with some low-hanging fruit” and take steps to mitigate new instances of cancer.
“The cancer rates we’re seeing are result from exposures 20, 30 years ago, we can’t change that now,” Weiner said. “(But) we know we have high radon levels in the state. There are unregulated tanning beds there, you know, too many Iowans are probably are using one form of tobacco or other. Again, we’ll be having conversations with our Republican colleagues, but I think everybody realizes this is an issue we have to deal with.”
How leadership changes, special elections will impact 2026
Three of the top legislative leadership positions are held by people elected by their peers this year to lead their caucus for the first time –Klimesh leading Iowa Senate Republicans, Meyer leading Iowa House Democrats and Kaufmann as the new House majority leader.
These changes come amid a shake-up heading into next year’s elections – former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl is running for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District and former Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst is running in Iowa’s 3rd District. The former Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver announced he will not seek reelection as he continues treatment following a brain tumor diagnosis.
The session will also be Reynolds’ last term as governor, as she is not seeking reelection in 2026.
Grassley, who was elected House speaker in 2020, said he does not foresee major changes coming from the new leadership.
“I don’t want to say business as usual in a bad way, but I think you’re going to see the House, the Senate, the governor, continue to be able to work together to be able to find resolution to difficult issues,” Grassley said. “We’ve displayed that for the last several years, taking on tough issues, and so I don’t think any of that necessarily just changes because there’s different individuals in some of the certain areas.”
A number of special elections in 2025 have also changed the makeup of the Iowa Legislature. Iowa Senate Democrats gained two seats in special elections in the past year – Sen. Catelin Drey in Senate District 1 and Sen. Mike Zimmer in District 35, breaking Republicans’ supermajority control of the chamber.
There’s one more special election in the Iowa Senate left this year, scheduled for Dec. 30 to fill the seat left by Sen. Claire Celsi, who died in October after a battle with an undisclosed illness.
While Republicans still hold a majority in the Senate, breaking the supermajority means Democrats could exert more control in the process of appointing gubernatorial nominees, which require two-thirds majority approval. Weiner said while “there may not be a ton of appointments, there definitely will be some,” pointing to the new appointments to the Iowa Board of Regents.
She also said while two of the Senate special elections were called because of tragic circumstances – the deaths of two senators – the special election campaigns have allowed Senate Democrats to hear directly from voters about what they want from the Legislature.
“We’ve had the opportunity since the beginning of January through the end of December to talk to voters all over the state, or more specifically, to listen to voters all over the state and hear what their concerns are,” Weiner said. “… It’s great to see new faces, and it’s also been a year of loss.”
The legislative session is set to begin Jan. 12, 2026.

It’s what happens when animals become “widgets,” farms become factories, and power quietly shifts from thousands of farmers to a handful of corporations.
In this season finale of “At the Iowa Farm Table,” Beth Hoffman digs into how chicken went from luxury to dollar-menu staple, and what we lost along the way. Journalist and author Christopher Leonard traces the rise of vertically integrated poultry and the contract system that keeps farmers under someone else’s thumb. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin reflects on how federal policy helped supercharge “efficiency,” and what that really cost rural communities.
Then we head back to the Midwest to meet two very different kinds of poultry operations charting another path.
We won’t solve chickenization in a 20-minute podcast. But we do ask a pointed question: if cheap meat comes with sick soils, hollowed-out towns, and stressed-out farmers, is it really efficient? (Click on the headline below the photo to listen to the podcast on Substack.)

Ohioans passed a constitutional amendment in 2006 that increases the state minimum wage every year based on the consumer price index.  
Ohio is one of 19 states that will raise its minimum wage on Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project.  
The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has not gone up since 2009. 
A couple of Democratic bills would raise Ohio’s minimum wage to $15 an hour, but neither of those bills have had any hearings. 
Ohio Senate Bill 234 would raise the minimum wage by a dollar per hour each year until reaching $15 per hour in 2029. Ohio State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, and Ohio Sen. Hearcel Craig, D-Columbus, introduced the bill. 
The bill would also eliminate the tipped employee minimum wage and require all employees to be paid the state’s minimum wage. 
Ohio House Bill 34 would increase the state’s minimum wage to $11 per hour on Jan. 1, 2026, $12 per hour in 2027, $13 per hour in 2028, $14 per hour in 2029, and $15 per hour in 2030. 
Twelve states and Washington, D.C. will have minimum wages of $15 or more as of Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project. 
Ohioans need to be making at least $22.51 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to a recent report by Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio and the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

It didn’t pass the legislature, but DeWine intended to use the $319 million it was projected to generate to help fund a $1,000 tax credit for families with children under seven.
If it had passed, the measure would have created economic benefits aside from the tax credit that utterly swamped its costs, according to a new analysis by Columbus-based Scioto Analysis. 
Mostly by getting adults to stop smoking and stopping teenagers from ever starting, the tax hike would produce $18.9 billion in social benefits over the coming decades, it said. That dwarfs the $816 million in estimated social costs. 
The conclusion was based on 10,000 computer simulations of raising the tax, the report said.
“We estimate that a $1.50 cigarette tax increase will cause 71,000 adults to quit smoking, 2,500 teenagers to either quit smoking or never start smoking, and adults who never start smoking to gain 45,000 years of life,” the report said. “The economic value of this mortality risk reduction to adults who will not start smoking is $177 billion. These are estimates of the value of benefits to individuals in the next year, whose health benefits we estimate over the next 68 years for adults and 81 years for teenagers.”
The analysis didn’t include the $177 billion in estimated savings to adults who would never start smoking thanks to the tax in its bottom-line conclusion.
Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States. With 15% of the state’s adults smoking, the rate of Ohioans who engage in the harmful activity is well above the national average of 12.1%.
In addition, mortality from health conditions associated with smoking is higher in Ohio than the national average, the report said. The habit also imposes costs on nonsmokers through secondhand smoke, increased health care costs and even fires that would otherwise have been avoided.
Raising taxes on cigarettes aren’t just a way to cover some of those costs, they’re also a way to shape consumer behavior.
“Cigarette taxes are one policy tool available for correcting irrationalities in the market,” the report said, citing studies showing that increased taxes reduce smoking. “If smokers underestimate long-term harm, higher prices can push consumption toward what they would choose with more perfect information.” 
The simulations found that the biggest benefits from increased cigarette taxes would accrue from people quitting or never picking up the habit. Altogether, Ohioans would have more than 100,000 years added to their collective lives, the models concluded. 
Meanwhile, the economic downsides that were simulated were losses to producers and lost taxes and legitimate sales due to increased smuggling from states where smokes are cheaper. 
One potential social cost the analysis didn’t appear to examine was the impact of cigarette taxes on families of people who would continue smoking. 
According to the anti-smoking nonprofit Truth Initiative, 72% of smokers are from low-income communities. So most of those who aren’t able to overcome their nicotine addiction live in households least able to afford more taxes.

The Catholic Church has always been a part of her, she says. (Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Tina Thompson found a different way to be Catholic.
She was ordained in November as a Roman Catholic Woman Priest, an international group that has tethered itself to the Catholic Church but isn’t officially recognized.
“This is about something so much bigger than me,” Thompson said in an interview on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “This is about women who want to show the world that we are the Roman Catholic Church.”


Thompson said she is the first Roman Catholic Woman Priest in Kansas, but she is one of hundreds of women Catholic priests around the world.
“We are still the church, but we are different in that we open the tent,” Thompson said. “We want everyone to feel like they are welcome.”
The organization’s mission focuses on ordaining mostly women who feel called to priesthood. It is often oriented toward social justice, Thompson said. The organization says its ordinations are valid because they have abided by apostolic succession, which refers to the transition of power from bishops and popes that originated with the Apostles. Each person who performs an ordination is connected to that line of authority.
A 10-member commission created by the late Pope Francis affirmed in a study made public earlier this month that women are not allowed to be ordained deacons, which are a rank below priests.
Thompson was raised Catholic. The religion was rooted in her family’s everyday. Her grandfather prayed each morning, she said. As she got older, Thompson drifted from the church. She did not condone its views, including those against divorce, women and same-sex marriage, and condemned its handling of cases of sexual abuse.
She was away from the church for roughly 20 years, but she said Catholicism was always a part of her.

Tina Thompson was ordained as Kansas’ first Roman Catholic Woman Priest on Nov. 1, 2025, at a Unity Church in Lawrence. (Submitted)

“It sort of gets in your DNA,” she said.
It wasn’t until her 60s that Catholicism piqued her interest again.
It came after Thompson lost her younger brother unexpectedly. Reflecting upon his death, Thompson said he never lost his faith, even in the face of addiction and health issues. Following his burial, she began searching online for Catholic woman priests. She said she felt called to do something bigger, which led her to the organization.
Women priests do not perform their duties in Catholic churches, and they cannot be officially ordained in one either. They are not recognized and are often excommunicated from the Catholic Church if they are heavily involved before their ordination as Roman Catholic women priests.
“We’re just a schism, as they say,” Thompson said.
Thompson was ordained at Lawrence’s Unity Church, a religious movement founded in Kansas City, Missouri, that blends Christianity with spiritualism, emphasizing inclusivity, a loose approach to worship and embracing personal transformation.
Thompson said she loves the Catholic Church’s sacraments, celebration of the Eucharist and singing.
“If you said, ‘Well, go be an Episcopal priest,’ it’s not the same. It’s just not the same,” Thompson said. “And I believe the Roman Catholic institutional church could be so much more, and I don’t want to give up on the church.”
A lot of good things come out of the traditional Catholic Church, Thompson said, “but they’re misguided in so many ways. And male-guided, in so many ways.”
Her ministry as a priest isn’t yet clear. She said she gravitates toward art and ensuring an inclusive spiritual practice, but she also said she doesn’t want to limit herself so early into her priesthood. Ultimately, priests “want everyone to feel this mystery,” she said. But it can be difficult to explain.
“Faith is about being together,” she said,” and celebrating in community and recognizing the gifts that we each have to offer to make the world a much better place.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC190256-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-29 11:12:12.827815

(Photo by Erin Socha for Kansas Reflector)CHAUTAUQUA COUNTY — About 15 years ago, Flint Hills rancher Bill Sproul was given an oak sapling, sprouted from an acorn dropped beneath the tree where conservationist Aldo Leopold sat and wrote his seminal 1949 collection of essays, “A Sand County Almanac.”
Sproul brought the sapling home to his ranch near Sedan and planted it, looking forward to the shade his Leopold oak would one day provide.




Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in the state of Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




It grew slowly. After two years, the sapling had four leaves. By the fourth year, it had six. But in the fifth year, one day the oak was gone. Next to its tiny stump sat a pile of rabbit pellets. And Sproul thinks Leopold would be thrilled by that.
“Because that rabbit belongs there too,” he said. “That tree belongs there, the rabbit belongs there, they all belong there. Somebody eat somebody, somebody eat them. So, I don’t have my Leopold oak no more. I got a Leopold rabbit. And maybe the coyote ate the rabbit. And now maybe I got a Leopold coyote. And that’s how I view everything out there.”
Cattle ranchers like Sproul have translated this conservationist philosophy into land management by adopting practices collectively known as “regenerative grazing.” This approach aims to preserve native grasslands and keep healthy ecosystems intact.
Sproul was the first recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Kansas Leopold Conservation Award, in 2015, for the work he has done on his 2,200-acre ranch in the southern Flint Hills.  There, he has removed thousands of woody invasive trees and incorporated holistic practices such as patch-burn grazing, which selectively burns pasture each year and rotates cattle at rates that allow native plants to flourish. The annual award is given to farmers and ranchers who, like Sproul, embrace their roles as environmental stewards.
Sproul knew he was doing something right when, after eight years of this type of management, rattlesnake master reappeared in his pastures. Rattlesnake master is a native flowering plant that can indicate healthy, high-quality prairie, but cattle will overgraze it if they’re allowed.
Native grasslands across the Great Plains evolved in large part because of the ecological disturbances of grazing animals and wildfire.

Rob Manes, co-director of regenerative grazing lands strategy for the Nature Conservancy, said managing cattle to allow plants time to recover is one of the foundational pillars of regenerative grazing.
“Once a pasture is grazed, most systems need a full growing season for those plants to be untouched and recover in order to reach their optimum ecological help,” Manes said. “That means they’re driving carbon into the soil. It means they’re replenishing their root stocks. It also means that those plants that get really hammered by cattle” have time to rest.
Some native species like rattlesnake master and compass plant, he said, are a “snickers bar” to cows.
But practices like overgrazing, Sproul said, are ingrained in a system that pushes for a maximum dollar return on every inch of land. Letting a pasture rest, or reducing the number of cattle during drought years, often means less profit.
“We push stuff too hard. We overgraze,” Sproul said. “If you can grow 200 bushels of corn, let’s shoot for 300. More fertilizer, more chemicals, better genetics, more and more and more. And if we don’t use it all up, it goes into the water system, and we have pollution, and we have all these problems with nitrates in the water and all kinds of stuff. But we’re going after 300 bushels of corn, because that’s what we’re taught. If there’s any grass left standing out there, get it.”

Reading about Leopold’s concept of land ethics in “A Sand County Almanac,” he said, changed his worldview.
He no longer views land as a commodity, he said, but as a community that includes the prairie, the oak, the rabbit and the coyote.
“When you view land as a commodity, you can do anything you want because it’s yours. You can plow it. You can overgraze it. You can over farm it, “ he said. “When you view land as a community, that’s when you can really start to love and cherish land. Instead of abusing it, you start taking care of it.”
Sproul’s Flint Hills ranch protects one of the last remaining tracts of what was once the second-most diverse ecosystem on the planet, behind only the Amazon rainforests.
“Tallgrass prairie was once the continent-defining ecosystem,” said Tony Capizzo, director of the Flint Hills Initiative for the Nature Conservancy.
“It stretched from Texas to Canada and from Kansas east through Iowa, Illinois and into northwest Indiana,” Capizzo added. “At the time of colonization, there was about 170 million acres of tallgrass prairie, and today we have less than 4% of that remaining. Two-thirds of what we have left is in the Flint Hills.”

A history of cattle ranching in Kansas is one of the reasons the Flint Hills were spared the plow, Capizzo said, while states like Iowa were almost completely converted to row crop agriculture.  Before colonization, native American tribes managed the grasslands with prescribed fire to influence bison migration.
Human intervention and disturbance have played a key role in the prairie’s evolution, said Manes, the Nature Conservancy’s regenerative grazing director. Grasslands not only benefit from grazing but need it in order to be healthy, he said.
“Regenerative grazing pivots on a couple of really fundamental principles,” Manes said. “One is appropriate disturbance. Without that, it turns into forest. The disturbance in the case of most prairie is grazing, the clipping of the plants, the hoof action in the soil, and most often fire at some interval. It might be a long time, but fire is almost always an important component.”
For a decade, Sproul practiced patch-burn grazing, a system which burned a third of the pasture each year. Cattle would graze new growth on burnt acres and leave the rest to rejuvenate. His system is simpler now, he said, and more similar to how fire lit by native Americans or lightning would burn: he just lights the fire once. Spots that are less dry or contain less fuel naturally extinguish themselves.

Sproul’s new method takes some of the fun out of it, he said.
“The most fun part of all of burning is relighting because it’s safe,” he said. “You can do it in 30 mph wind because it’s black all around you. You’re riding around on your four-wheeler, and you’re looking for horns, and you’re lighting fire. Fire takes off because the wind’s blowing like crazy. And none of your neighbors care, because they’ve all burned. We don’t do that no more.”
Allowing the fire to burn unevenly creates a landscape mosaic that is essential for what Manes describes as another one of the fundamental principles of regenerative grazing.
“What we’re looking for is heterogeneity across the landscape,” Manes said.
A mix of growth provides different habitats for different species, especially grassland birds.
“You have one place that’s been grazed recently,” he said, “one place that hasn’t been grazed for a long time, and that’s where the prairie chickens and the Henslow’s sparrows nest, and over here is where the American golden plovers eat when they’re migrating through in the the fall, because they like the bare ground. And so, you create that diversity. It also creates resilience in the pastures and helps a rancher ensure that she or he will have grass even in drought conditions.”
After decades of ranching, Sproul isn’t terribly concerned with passing his ranch on to his children. His ranch, he said, is just a postage stamp compared to the whole world.
“I would rather instill in my children and grandchildren land ethics,” he said. “That’s where you can pass your legacy on.”
“Nothing is really ours, it’s the next, the next, and the next and the next,” he added. “We’re just stewards here for a little while.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sproul-Ranch-1-1024x601.jpg,,,2025-12-29 09:58:35.511094

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUESTS: Zurui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. 







THE PRIMARY CARE crisis has become an innovation problem for states.   
The problem, at its root, is that not enough physicians are choosing to go into or remain in primary care to meet demand. Fixing long-standing issues with lower reimbursement rates for primary care – a big cause of the crisis – is a complicated puzzle that involves federal policy. It’s not a challenge that states can easily overcome on their own.  
But “what states can do is think about primary care in new ways,” said Zurui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
Song talked with John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast. 
Primary care practice “has continued to not be attractive enough for the majority of our trainees to stay in the field,” Song said. “And at the same time, there is a growing off-ramp of exits from traditional primary care practice into more free market models of practice, including concierge primary care, direct primary care — models of practice that are a little more detached from the traditional delivery system, the integrated delivery system, or the large group practice, and in some cases, or detached from health insurance completely.” 
Long-time primary care physicians are finding “more autonomy and more restored joys of practice” and more time face-to-face with patients outside of those traditional models, he said.    
“So the exits are growing, the entries are slowing,” he said, “just at a time when we need more supply for a growing demand for primary care. And that is the national crisis that we face.” 
States can exert more direct control than “just toggling the fees up and down” for certain primary care options, Song said. States like Massachusetts, which has a dedicated primary care task force making recommendations to up state spending on primary care, can reform payment models to be more tailored to the people receiving care at any given primary care clinic.  
Some states have experimented with a multi-payer system, Song noted, while others like California, Colorado, and Delaware have moved toward setting state targets for primary care spending.  
“The most, innovative, or the farthest departure from primary care being simply part of the fee schedule is probably thinking about primary care as a public utility,” Song said.  
That would mean reframing primary care as “something akin to when you turn on the faucet in the kitchen, water runs. You expect water to run. When you flip on your light switch, you expect electricity to be running… Fundamentally, thinking about primary care as a public utility allows a state or a self-insured employer, or any entity responsible for paying for care, to lift It out of the fee schedule and concept and then that opens up possibilities for financing, for dispersing the financing, for potentially even organizing the care.” 
On the episode, Hattis, McDonough, and Song discuss the primary care crisis nationally (3:30) and in Massachusetts (8:30), and dive into the promise and issues with private equity in health care (19:30).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 09:12:23.210416

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Two people fight on a sidewalk as a police officer pulls up in a squad car. Shouting, a man turns to the officer, while the woman walks away.
The situation can go any number of ways from there. It’s up to the officers in training to decide what to do in the computer-simulated scenario. Standing in front of a screen, their response dictates the outcome. The situation is one of many they will practice at the Criminal Justice Academy in Columbia, where every new police officer in the state undergoes training.
Last year, the academy turned out just over 1,000 students, who went on to work for law enforcement agencies across the state.
For 12 weeks, including four online, recruits learn about the law, self-defense and how to use their weapons. Woven through all their training is crisis communication, which teaches officers how to handle as many situations as possible through talking while still recognizing when they might need to use force.
Crisis communication
Outside, the recruits learned how to fire a gun. Inside, they learn when to fire their gun, instructor Donta Stewart told the half-dozen recruits waiting for their turn with the computer simulation.
The first recruit successfully defused the situation, even after the computer-generated man reached for a rolled-up flag to use as a weapon. Talking to the man, the officer got him to drop the flag and get on his knees without drawing his weapon.
Another recruit faced a very different outcome. When she failed to get the man to listen, he wielded the flag, moving as if to strike her. The recruit pulled out her gun and shot the computer-generated man three times, killing him.

“Think about this for a second,” Stewart said after that attempt, turning the lights back on.
Stewart walked the recruit through the scenario, asking questions along the way. What could the recruit have done as she approached the scene? What sorts of cues should she have been looking for? Why did she decide to fire? How could she have kept the situation from escalating to that point?
Scottie Frier, another instructor who specializes in deescalation, starts his crisis communication classes with a question: Could recruits talk themselves into five situations that cause them to use force?
“If you agree with that, then let’s say, ‘All right, well, then let’s learn to talk ourselves out of five use-of-force situations,’” Frier said.
When new officers start at the academy, most have never faced the types of situations police deal with on a regular basis, said agency director Jackie Swindler. If they’ve never been in a fight or had someone take a swing at them, they may not know how to react the first time it happens, he said.
That could lead to a situation getting out of control and an officer using a weapon or other forceful tactics in a situation that could have had a peaceful outcome. Even if a person the officer is interacting with disobeys instructions, officers need to learn how to communicate first, before turning to other methods, he added.
Communication “is your best tool,” Swindler said new recruits learn. “That is your best weapon.”
It’s also most of what officers will do during their day-to-day jobs, Swindler said. Officers must understand how to handle all sorts of situations, including helping people having mental health crises and knowing when to report fellow officers for misconduct.
“Officers have to wear a lot of hats,” Swindler said. “They have to be counselors. They have to be preachers and teachers and then, of course, make people follow rules.”
12 weeks of training
The simulations come at the end of recruits’ 12-week training.
When new sheriff’s deputies, police officers and other law enforcement officers are first hired, they spend four weeks doing online courses with videos recorded by academy instructors, Swindler said.
That started in 2019, in an effort to remedy long wait times between hiring and training that left new officers in limbo, he said. At one point, recruits were waiting an average of 106 days to start their training, worsening vacancy rates in understaffed departments.

After each week of online material, recruits must pass a test to move onto the next week of training. At the end of the four weeks, every recruit must pass an in-person, cumulative exam, Swindler said.
Recruits who pass that test and a physical fitness exam start their in-person training within the following two weeks, depending on where they fall in the rotation.
At the academy’s campus in Columbia, new hires must learn legal basics, self-defense tactics and how to conduct traffic stops and sobriety tests. One week is dedicated entirely to firearms training, followed by two weeks of practical scenarios for recruits to use what they learned in approximations of real-world situations.
A small group of buildings, referred to as the village, allows recruits to practice routine traffic stops and rehearse scenarios in classrooms, banks and courthouses, including testifying during a mock hearing. In a warehouse with moveable walls and plush furniture, officers can practice clearing people out of homes, bars and schools in preparation for hostage situations or active shooters.
Instructors watch from a catwalk above.
“We try to replicate as much as we can,” Swindler said. “But those recruits, as much as we can make them stressed or nervous to see what it’s about, they know there are two things that are not going to happen: We’re not going to beat them up, and we’re not going to kill them.”
The training can be difficult, Swindler said.
Some recruits may flunk their academic tests, while others may not be physically fit enough to complete the obstacle courses. Sometimes, the academy has to dismiss students for having a bad attitude or being unprofessional, he said.
By the end of the 12 weeks, 73% of recruits graduate, said spokeswoman Mikie Pylilo.
“We kind of categorize ourselves as gatekeepers,” Swindler said.
Addressing AI
As technology evolves, so does the academy’s training.
Officers must continue completing courses throughout their careers, with a required minimum of 40 hours of additional training due every three years, Swindler said. That may involve refreshers on the law or defensive tactics, but it may also mean updates to what officers learned when they first started.

Artificial intelligence is one area Swindler is watching closely. The academy isn’t yet updating its curriculum to include the technology and all its burgeoning uses, but as it becomes more popular, instructors may have to add it in the coming years, he said.
AI could be an asset for police, helping them analyze reports, find patterns and scrub large sources of data, such as body camera footage, Swindler said. It could also cause major problems if people can falsify videos and attempt to use those as evidence.
Officers will need to be aware of how to recognize an AI-generated video and be sure not to arrest a person based on a video alone, making sure they gather other evidence, Swindler said.
That’s another place where communication skills will come in handy.
“There are a lot of things that still would require old-fashioned policing,” Swindler said. “Talking, looking, smelling, touching, all those things.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5585-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 09:12:23.210416

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Framed by the fireplace in Alaska’s governor’s mansion earlier this month, Gov. Mike Dunleavy shook hands and posed for pictures in the final holiday open house of his two terms as Alaska’s top elected official.
Dunleavy is prohibited from running for another term, and 14 candidates have already signed up to run for his office in the 2026 elections. One of those candidates, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, stood next to Dunleavy at the open house, smiling alongside her husband. 
Speaking to reporters before the open house, Dunleavy said the highlight of the year at a statewide level was the signing of a gas pipeline contract with developer Glenfarne. 
“It started what I think is going to be a real pipeline,” Dunleavy said. “It’s something that the state has dreamed about for decades, ever since the trans-Alaska oil pipeline came into being.”
Since January, when Glenfarne announced it was buying into the long-pursued Alaska LNG pipeline project, it’s announced a series of preliminary agreements from international companies interested in buying gas.
To date, it doesn’t have firm deals for either buying or selling, and it is expected to make a go/no-go decision on the first phase of the project — a pipeline from the North Slope to Southcentral Alaska for in-state use — within the next month.
“I think in January there’s going to be some major announcements that will solidify that this pipeline as a go,” Dunleavy said. 
Dunleavy said he’s also been pleased with rising forecasts for Alaska North Slope oil. In November, the federal Energy Information Administration predicted that North Slope production would grow 13% in 2026, reaching levels that haven’t been seen since 2018. 
“That’s good for Alaska as well,” Dunleavy said, “because of the renaissance on the Slope.”
The state’s unemployment rate is holding below 5%, he noted.
“When you look at the turmoil across the country and you look at the turmoil across the world, I think Alaska is in pretty good shape. … We have a lot of resources here, and I think we have a lot of great people,” he said.
Asked for the lowest point of the year on a statewide basis, Dunleavy said: “You’re always dealing with disasters. Under my tenure, there’s been 73 declared disasters … we had the issue out in Western Alaska, and so we have to add now a typhoon to our mix of volcanoes, earthquakes and so forth.”
Dunleavy himself was affected by the recent Matanuska-Susitna Borough windstorm disaster, and his wife couldn’t attend the holiday open house as a result.
“We lost some of our roofing on a building or two out there, and the heat went out,” he said.
While disasters are part of living in Alaska, he said Typhoon Halong was something extra.
“I would say that whenever a disaster impacts people at the visceral level, at the local level, at their household level — we got hit hard with that typhoon,” he said.
For much of the year, as in his conversation with reporters, the governor preferred to focus on the positives.
Earlier this year, Dunleavy said the arrival of the Trump administration was “like Christmas every morning” for Alaska.
Since Trump was sworn into office, his administration has relaxed restrictions on oil and gas drilling on the North Slope. It has advanced the Ambler Access Project, which promises to open a large mining area in Northwest Alaska. 
The Interior Department has also pushed forward the road between Cold Bay and King Cove and proposals to explore for oil in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Dunleavy administration has been enthusiastic in its support of those actions, but most have been tied up in federal court and will be for months or years.
The ANWR drilling issue, for example, won’t even come before a federal judge until late 2026, according to a status update published this month in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
The Trump-backed Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress this year will deliver millions of dollars in construction projects to the state, and other legislation will provide millions more, but other projects — particularly those involving renewable energy and projects intended to deal with climate change — were eliminated.
“Christmas every morning” entailed other metaphorical bits of coal for Alaska this year: The extended government shutdown left thousands of Alaskans unpaid for over a month, and the cuts instituted by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency caused significant amounts of uncertainty.
In the long run, DOGE doesn’t appear to have significantly affected the number of federal jobs here: The latest available figures show more federal employees in the state than there were at the start of the year.
While some federal grants targeted by DOGE have since been restored, many were not. Public radio stations and arts organizations laid off staff and curtailed their work. 
Tariffs, visa issues and a prolonged dispute with Canada threatened the summer tourist season, but a feared Yukon boycott never appeared, and the number of cruise ship passengers traveling to Alaska increased slightly, to a new record high of more than 1.7 million.
At the holiday open house, Dunleavy said there’s plenty to look forward to in the coming year and in the years once he leaves office.
“There’s just a whole host of things — the possibility of data farms, artificial intelligence, and how that’s gonna revolutionize not just the world, but here in Alaska, I think we could become a data transportation center because of our proximity on the globe. So I think you’re going to see a number of announcements throughout the year that I think will set the stage for a great several decades going forward,” he said.

The data purges begin (March) 
Soon into the new Trump term, data began to vanish from government websites. That included erosion mapping from FEMA and long-relied-upon research sets from the National Institutes of Health. Reporter Jennifer Smith talked with Ariel Beccia, an instructor in epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has since had her funding slashed, to discuss the effect of the Trump administration’s purges of health-related government data and researchers’ efforts to respond. 
“A lot of people think these data sets are just used by academics to do research in the ivory tower, to work on their papers,” Beccia said. “But that’s not the case at all. It has such a direct implication on the lives and well-being of individuals and communities thorough the US and here in Massachusetts.”

Primary care crisis (August) 
On the Health or Consequences series of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute have dived deep into the primary care crisis in Massachusetts and nationally. The diagnosis is dire: profound burnout, understaffing, and pay issues are creating more incentives for new physicians to steer clear of primary care in favor of specialty practices. This is creating knock-on effects throughout the health care industry for patients and institutions alike.  
In this episode, Hattis and McDonough talk with Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health. 
“This will become a nation of people with chronic disease,” Dickson said. “And as the population ages and medications get better to keep people alive longer, it’s a little bit scary to think about the shortage of primary care that exists today, and how bad that will be 10 years from now, if something doesn’t change.”  

LISTEN

Municipal budgets feeling the pinch (November) 
As federal policy changes prompted Massachusetts officials to take a hard look at the state budget, CommonWealth Beacon took a look at the roller coaster of funding cities and towns. Reporter Chris Lisinski unpacked municipal finance with Massachusetts Municipal Association executive director Adam Chapdelaine, Amesbury mayor Kassandra Gove, and Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance executive director Paul Craney.   
“There’s this friction for the taxpayer that their taxes are going up and they’re paying a lot here, but they are getting less for that dollar,” Gove said.   
The guests debated how much of the municipal strain is a result of recent political developments versus longer-term structural factors and discuss the history and future of Proposition 2½.

Rising tides and retreating towns (May) 
In a special live episode of The Codcast during a month of focused climate coverage, reporter Jennifer Smith and CAI radio’s Eve Zuckoff (now of WBUR) took a trip out to Provincetown to talk with local experts about how the Cape is working to weather the changing climate.  
They were joined by Jay Coburn, president and CEO of the Community Development Partnership – the non-profit community development corporation serving the eight towns of lower and outer Cape Cod; Mark Borrelli, a coastal geologist and director of the Coastal Processes and Ecosystems Laboratory (or CaPE Lab); and Timothy Famulare, the community development director for Provincetown and formerly the town’s environmental planner and conservation agent.  
The Cape and Islands have been grappling with dueling pressures: increased demand to live in these desirable coastal towns and the reality that the very thing that makes them so attractive is carving away at the available land.

Is the T turning it around? (July) 
For years, the MBTA has been on a bumpy track. Between inadequate funding, weather crises like the winter of 2015, and dramatic scenes of buses or trains aflame, being in charge of the state’s major transit system was no easy task. Then Gov. Maura Healey tapped Phil Eng as general manager, and even through painful commutes, the tone has shifted. 
Reporter Gintautas Dumcius (now author of State House News Services’s MASSterList newsletter) talked with Eng about his first few years helming the famously troubled MBTA. This was before Eng also took over as maybe-interim-maybe-permanent transportation secretary. 
A civil engineer, Eng came to the MBTA from his post as president of the Long Island Rail Road in New York. From his vantage point as a newcomer, Eng said, “we were basically going towards shutting down the system, if you ask me, if we’d continued down this path.”

California lawmakers only spent just a few minutes discussing in public the hundreds of bills they introduce. But these 10 measures had hours of intense debate in 2025.


Most bills in the California Legislature are barely talked about in public before lawmakers take action, often after secret negotiations with lobbyists.
But a handful of controversial proposals broke through the usual rushed process, drawing hours of testimony and intense public lobbying from some of the state’s most powerful organizations that spend millions of dollars to get their way, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database, which tracks every word spoken in the Legislature. 
That’s compared to the overall 2025 average, which showed lawmakers and advocates spent just 32 minutes publicly talking about each of the 1,657 bills that were discussed in at least one hearing.
These were the 10 most debated bills of the 2025 regular legislative session, according to Digital Democracy.(Note: Advocacy groups listed below may have changed their positions as the bills were amended.)
Divide over antisemitism bill
Bill: Assembly Bill 715
Lead author: Democratic assemblymembers Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo and Rick Zbur of Los Angeles.
Time discussed: 15 hours
Approximate number of speakers: 486
Why it was a talker: California’s Jewish lawmakers made countering antisemitism in schools their top priority this year, but opposing the bill was a coalition of education groups, unions, civil rights advocates and Muslim community organizations who feared censorship of pro-Palestinian voices and infringement on academic freedom. The groups turned out in droves to testify.
Number of groups in support: At least 68, including the Jewish Community Action, the Los Angeles County Business Federation and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
Number of groups opposed: At least 92, including the California Federation of Teachers, the California Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the California School Boards Association.
Status: Signed into law. 
Local governments balk at transit-oriented housing
Bill: Senate Bill 79
Lead author: Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco
Time discussed: 6 hours, 40 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 198
Why it was a talker: Local governments balked at a new state mandate allowing developers to build midrise apartment buildings within walking distance of many major train, light-rail, subway and high-frequency rapid bus stations — even if local zoning restrictions would otherwise ban such dense development. 
Number of groups in support: At least 49, including pro home-building groups and the California Apartment Association.
Number of groups opposed: At least 76, including, at one point, the building trades unions, the California Association of Realtors and dozens of municipalities.
Status: Signed into law.

Charter schools oppose new restrictions
Bill: Assembly Bill 84
Lead authors: Democratic assemblymembers Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga and Al Muratsuchi of Torrance. 
Time discussed: 6 hours, 32 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 491
Why it was a talker: This was the latest legislative effort by California’s powerful teachers unions and their allies to add restrictions and oversight to charter schools. Homeschool families and charter schools opposed the measure, introduced in response to high-profile charter school fraud scandals, saying it would strip millions of dollars in state funding from their programs. The bill added auditing requirements and new fees as well as a proposed new Office of Inspector General inside the Department of Education.
Number of groups in support: At least six, almost all influential unions.
Number of groups opposed: More than 200, many of them charter schools or home school groups.
Status: Failed in the Senate. 
Uproar over teen sexual solicitation
Bill: Assembly Bill 379
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove
Time discussed: 5 hours, 28 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 149
Why it was a talker: This bill, originally authored by Democratic Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, a former state prosecutor, sought to increase penalties for soliciting teen sex. But the legislation sparked difficult discussions between progressive and moderate members of the Democratic caucus about how hard to crack down on those accused of soliciting sex from minors, based on whether the victims were younger or older teenagers.
Number of groups in support: At least 48, including law enforcement unions and some Native American tribes.   
Number of groups opposed: At least 25, including ACLU and various advocates for progressive criminal justice reforms.
Status: Signed into law.

Bill: Senate Bill 627 
Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Jessie Arreguín of Berkeley and three other senators
Time discussed: 5 hours
Approximate number of speakers: 100
Why it was a talker: Members of California’s Democratic legislative supermajority aren’t shy about speaking their minds on President Donald Trump and his controversial immigration policies, so it’s no surprise that there was a lot of discussion over California’s first-in-the nation measure to prohibit federal immigration officers and local police from wearing masks in California. 
Number of groups in support: At least 45, including non-police unions, public defenders, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.
Number of groups opposed: At least 16, almost all of them police unions.
Status: Signed into law
Democrats pitch gerrymander to counter Texas
Bill: Assembly Bill 604
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry of Davis and Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach
Time discussed: 4 hours, 58 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 76
Why it was a talker: There were plenty of heated discussions after California Democrats put forward their own gerrymandering plan after Trump pressured Texas to change its congressional maps to make new Republican districts. 
Number of groups in support: At least 54, including labor unions and progressive groups. 
Number of groups opposed: At least 19, including California Common Cause, Govern for California and conservative groups.
Status: Signed into law, approved by voters

Energy bill gets lengthy debate
Bill: Senate Bill 254
Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park and two other lawmakers.
Time discussed: 4 hours, 55 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 119
Why it was a talker: This energy bill created a new public financing system for electric transmission projects and extended a controversial program that shields utilities from some wildfire liability costs, but critics warned it could ultimately drive consumer bills higher. It was part of a package of energy and climate measures the Legislature passed this year.
Number of groups in support: At least 55, including trades unions, the California Democratic Party, the California Chamber of Commerce, environmental groups and the California Municipal Utilities Association.
Number of groups opposed: At least seven, including the California Farm Bureau Federation, Rural County Representatives of California and the California State Association of Counties.
Status: Signed into law.
Fees for veterans’ benefits draws testimony
Bill: Senate Bill 694 
Lead author: Democratic Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Sabrina Cervantes of Riverside
Time discussed: 4 hours, 39 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 99
Why it was a talker: For years, veterans advocates have wanted a state law preventing  companies from charging exorbitant fees to help veterans file federal disability benefits claims, something they can do for free through the government and certain veterans’ organizations. But the Legislature has repeatedly balked, as companies claim they provide an important service to help veterans get the benefits they need.
Number of groups in support: At least 25, including the California State Association of Counties and the American Legion. 
Number of groups opposed: At least nine, including Veterans Guardian, one of the companies that files claims.
Status: The bill did not pass the Senate, although lawmakers announced they had a deal on the legislation and would vote on it in January.

Bill: Assembly Bill 470
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Tina McKinnor of Inglewood
Time discussed: 4 hours, 13 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 209
Why it was a talker: AT&T has spent millions in lobbying as it tried unsuccessfully to bow out of its legal requirement to provide copper landlines in much of the state. Rural communities and others pushed back, leading to some of the lengthiest discussions in the Legislature this year. 
Number of groups in support: At least 145, including AT&T, some tribes and other groups aligned with the telecommunications company. 
Number of groups opposed: At least 96, including rural counties, some unions and AARP.
Status: Failed in the Senate.

During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one is from September. 
Galen Bacharier: “I spent a lot of time this year covering the recovery from Hurricane Helene in broad, regional terms — statistics on homes destroyed and roads closed, dollar amounts in the hundreds of millions. It was a breath of fresh air, then, to travel to Mitchell County and report on something entirely different: one couple’s life and home, upended by the floodwaters and now slowly coming back together.
“Leo and Tessa’s story represented a lot of what I thought best embodied the people of western North Carolina as they rebuilt from Helene. Proudly independent, but also not afraid to lean on their neighbors and friends. Embracing the natural beauty of their home, and fiercely dedicated to maintaining it. And remarkably kind, as they made time for me to visit the riverside homestead and ask them about the most challenging time of their lives. It was a privilege to report and write this profile, part of a three-part series focused on western communities rebuilding from the worst storm in North Carolina’s history. Thank you for reading.”
GREEN MOUNTAIN — A few ounces of Helene’s floodwaters remain trapped in the headlight of Leo Sharp’s Harley-Davidson.
When the Nolichucky River surged, it swallowed the bike, flooded the tool shed and ripped away the vegetation. Water rushing down the mountain left everything caked in mud, the barn barely standing and half of the home destroyed.
The year since has brought a new roof; a reinforced shed; the skeleton of a new bedroom. Sharp and Tessa Reed, who call the riverside property home, still sleep most nights in a tent pitched on wooden scaffolding across the property.
Estimated repair costs were far beyond their own means. The couple didn’t have flood insurance, and have yet to receive aid from FEMA. Help has come in fits and spurts, from neighbors, friends and church groups. At first, they had hoped to have the home repaired by July 2025. Now, the timeline is indefinite.
“It’s hard to get any one thing done when everyone is pulling you in different directions,” Reed said, standing in the echoey, wrapped shell of a room. A rolled-up carpet and cardboard are stuffed in a clawfoot bathtub.
They don’t plan to leave or sell. Nor do their neighbors. They’ll stay and rebuild, they’ve decided, even if it’s with their own hands.
“In the moment, it was like, what are we going to do?” Sharp said. “Then afterward, you’re just saying, ‘thank God I have you.’ Thank God for everything we do have. Everything else just kind of becomes unimportant. It’s been a hell of an onion to peel.”

The homestead
Sharp and Reed, 38 and 29, moved to Mitchell County three years ago. Their new, century-old home was a dream come true, a far cry from their original home in Virginia and Sharp’s decade aboard a Navy submarine.
They had transformed their home into a business — selling herbs and tea, eggs, honey from their beehives. Helene destroyed the garden, topped the beehives, washed away the chicken coops and ruined freezers full of meat and vegetables.
After checking on their neighbor Freddie and Sharp’s mom, who lives five miles away, they began to dig out. The bedroom was unsalvagable, with the foundation eroded and black mold creeping in. An estimate for a bare minimum rebuild totaled $120,000, nearly what they paid for the home in the first place. Somehow, it could have been worse.
“I think if we had another three inches (of rain), we would have lost the house and the barn,” Reed said.

Over the coming months, neighbors, friends and roving groups of volunteers and charity workers began to take on projects on the property.
One group rebuilt an enclosure for the ducks and geese, digging out a small pond and building a wire fence. Two young Amish men helped install insulation, and built a retaining wall to prevent the shed from collapsing. A group of men from Wisconsin helped the couple construct the bedroom’s frame. And Living Grace Ministries, a Virginia-based church, has had members coming by for months to lend a hand.
A friend named Mike, who lived two hours south in Saluda, would make daily trips up to help the couple. He brought them peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
“We’ve called him Mountain Dad,” Reed said, smiling.
The river
The Nolichucky was unrecognizable when the flooding subsided. An island in front of the couple’s home looked more like a landfill: toppled trees, scraps of metal from cars and homes.
After months without a hint of green, Sharp spotted a bundle of yellow daffodils sprouted among the debris. A year after the storm, the island is mostly rebuilt, and plants grow again.

Still, the couple has gotten to know the local wildlife well — and saw both the storm and the cleanup upheave it.
“Truck after truck after truck, excavators driving through the river,” Reed said.
The excavator was such a common sight that it earned a nickname: “Carl.”
“We had seen hellbenders and trout during the spring and the summer,” she said. “While we were out here fishing, almost every day.
“You couldn’t pay me to get in that water now. I don’t care how many water tests come back OK.”
Reed’s a bird person. But she hasn’t seen kingfishers or osprey fly over, as they normally do. Sometimes she spots a heron.
She started seeing copperheads frequently after the storm, after having seen none in years. Sharp’s mother and her neighbors started to see bears venturing further out, near homes.

The mine
In recent months, Sharp and Reed noticed work vehicles and excavators constantly coming down the railroad tracks. A neighbor’s Facebook posts shed light on why: a 50-acre mining operation along the Nolichucky to supply CSX the materials it needed to stabilize a railroad bed.
For those living nearby, the noise was deafening and constant — sometimes going into the early morning hours.
But for Sharp and Reed, it was the air quality that was the most apparent: clouds of dust descending on their home. Reed has systemic lupus, and had started to notice more persistent flares. And Sharp had recently had a cancer scare.
“It gets in the house, it gets in your car, it gets in everything,” Reed said.
Sharp, a licensed drone pilot, captured overhead footage of the active mine. When the Department of Labor learned that the operation was being done without a permit and a judge shut it down days later, his photographs and video accompanied the story across TV stations.

It was, it seemed, another test for a region already exhausted by hurricane recovery.
“Out here after Helene, there were so many people that dipped their fingers into the area,” Reed said. “It’s just fishy … opportunistic.”
In late August, the company’s application for a permit was denied by the Department of Environmental Quality.
“Taking advantage of our area was not the right move,” Sharp said. “It did a lot of people harm, so we fought it. Even though we’ve only lived here a few years… we fought for it to get shut down. This is where we call home.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3564-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

A new law orders regulators to study the cost impacts of fast-growing, energy-hungry AI data centers. Lawmakers are expected to revisit tougher rules as utilities, advocates and tech groups battle over who pays for the grid upgrades.


Tools that power artificial intelligence devour energy. But attempts to shield regular Californians from footing the bill in 2025 ended with a law requiring regulators to write a report about the issue by 2027.
If that sounds pretty watered down, it is. Efforts to regulate the energy usage of data centers — the beating heart of AI — ran headlong into Big Tech, business groups and the governor. 
That’s not surprising given that California is increasingly dependent on big tech for state revenue: A handful of companies pay upwards of $5 billion just on income tax withholding.
The law mandating the report is the lone survivor of last year’s push to rein in the data-center industry. Its deadline means the findings won’t likely be ready in time for lawmakers to use in 2026. The measure began as a plan to give data centers their own electricity rate, shielding households and small businesses from higher bills.
It amounts to a “toothless” measure, directing the utility regulator to study an issue it already has the authority to investigate, said Matthew Freedman, a staff attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocate.
Data centers’ enormous electricity demand has pushed them to the center of California’s energy debate, and that’s why lawmakers and consumer advocates say new regulations matter.
For instance, the sheer amount of energy requested by data centers in California is prompting questions about costly grid upgrades even as speculative projects and fast-shifting AI loads make long-term planning uncertain. Developers have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity for data centers, more than enough to serve every household in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.
But the report could help shape future debates as lawmakers revisit tougher rules and the CPUC considers new policies on what data centers pay for power – a discussion gaining urgency as scrutiny of their rising electricity costs grows, he said.
“It could be that the report helps the Legislature to understand the magnitude of the problem and potential solutions,”  Freedman said. “It could also inform the CPUC’s own review of the reasonableness of rates for data center customers, which they are likely to investigate.”
State Sen. Steve Padilla, a Democrat from Chula Vista, says that the final version of his law “was not the one we would have preferred,” agreeing that it may seem “obvious” the CPUC can study data center cost impacts.  The measure could help frame future debates and at least “says unequivocally that the CPUC has the authority to study these impacts” as demand from data centers accelerates, Padilla added.
“(Data centers) consume huge amounts of energy, huge amounts of resources, and at least in the near future, we’re not going to see that change,” he said.
Earlier drafts of Padilla’s measure went further, requiring data centers to install large batteries to support the grid during peak demand and pushing utilities to supply them with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030 — years ahead of the state’s own mandate. Those provisions were ultimately stripped out.
How California’s first push to regulate data centers slipped away
California’s bid to bring more oversight to data centers unraveled earlier this year under industry pressure, ending with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s veto of a bill requiring operators to report their water use. Concerns over the bills reflected fears that data-center developers could shift projects to other states and take valuable jobs with them.
A September Stanford report on powering California data centers said the state risks losing property-tax revenue, union construction jobs and “valuable AI talent” if data-center construction moves out of state.
The idea that increased regulation could lead to businesses or dollars in some form leaving California is an argument that has been brought up across industries for decades. It often does not hold up to more careful or long-term scrutiny. 
In the face of this opposition, two key proposals stalled in the Legislature’s procedural churn. Early in the session, Padilla put a separate clean-power incentives proposal for data centers on hold until 2026. Later in the year, an Assembly bill requiring data centers to disclose their electricity use was placed in the Senate’s suspense file – where appropriations committees often quietly halt measures.
Newsom, who has often spoken of California’s AI dominance, echoed the industry’s competitiveness worries in his veto message of the water-use reporting requirement. The governor said he was reluctant to impose requirements on data centers, “without understanding the full impact on businesses and the consumers of their technology.”
Despite last year’s defeats, some lawmakers say they will attempt to tackle the issue again.
Padilla plans to try again with a bill that would add new rules on who pays for data centers’ long-term grid costs in California, while Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan — a Democrat from San Ramon — will revisit her electricity-disclosure bill.
Big Tech warns of job losses but one advocate sees an opening
After blocking most measures last year — and watering down the lone energy-costs bill — Big Tech groups say they’ll revive arguments that new efforts to regulate data centers could cost California jobs.
At a CalMatters event in November, Silicon Valley Leadership Group CEO Ahmad Thomas argued that California must compete to attract investments like the $40 billion data-center project Texas secured with  Google. Any policy making deals like that tougher next year would provoke conflict, he added.
“When we get to the details of what our regulatory regime looks like versus other states, or how we can make California more competitive…that’s where sometimes we struggle to find that happy medium,” he said.
Despite having more regulations than some states, California continues to toggle between the 4th and 5th largest economy in the world and has for some time, suggesting that the Golden State is very competitive. 
Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, another industry lobbying group, said new requirements on data centers should apply to all other large electricity users.
“To single out one industry is not something that we think would set a helpful precedent, ” Diorio said. “We’ve been very consistent with that throughout the country.”
Critics say job loss fears are overblown, noting California built its AI sector without the massive hyperscale facilities that typically gravitate to states with ample, cheaper land and streamlined permitting.
Data-center locations — driven by energy prices, land and local rules — have little to do with where AI researchers live, said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside.
“These two things are sort of separate, they’re decoupled,” he said.  
Freedman, of TURN, said lawmakers may have a bargaining chip: if developers cared about cheaper power, they wouldn’t be proposing facilities in a state with high electric rates. That means speed and certainty may be the priority, giving lawmakers the space to potentially offer quicker approvals in exchange for developers covering more grid costs. 
“There’s so much money in this business that the energy bills – even though large – are kind of like rounding errors for these guys,” Freedman said. “If that’s true, then maybe they shouldn’t care about having to pay a little bit more to ensure that costs aren’t being shifted to other customers.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110625-Data-Center-San-Jose-BH-Reuters-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

A variety of decisions and statements from President Donald Trump created a great deal of economic uncertainty, especially in California.


California is ending the year in much the same way it started: uncertain about what impact President Donald Trump’s policies and actions will have on its economy. 
Immigration raids and the threat of them negatively affected the state’s residents, communities and labor markets in different industries. Farmworkers and farmers are anxious about the future. Citizens and noncitizens of Los Angeles and surrounding areas lost work after the raids, according to one study. 
California, home to some of the nation’s busiest ports, had to deal with ever-changing tariffs. The agricultural and wine industries worried about higher costs and their ability to maintain relationships with their export partners, who received not just tariff threats but other presidential rhetoric. For example, Trump’s talk of annexing Canada angered some Canadians and affected tourism into the state and the rest of the nation. 
The tech industry dealt with a mishmash of policies that included Nvidia agreeing to revenue-sharing with the federal government; the U.S. taking a stake in Intel; and new fees on H-1B visas. Still, the hype around artificial intelligence has been mostly a boon for the industry, especially Big Tech, which helped drive tax revenue to state coffers.
Property insurance has also had a big effect on California’s economy. For years, insurers have shied away from writing policies in the state, citing increased wildfire risk. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara this year implemented new regulations meant to encourage companies to resume writing policies, but the Los Angeles County fires in January complicated the issue. Now fire survivors complain that insurers are trying to raise rates while delaying or denying claims, and have called for Lara to resign. 
2026 outlook 
Higher spending, partly because of federal funding cuts, means a nearly $18 billion budget deficit next year, the Legislative Analyst’s Office predicts. That could include trying to fill gaps in spending on health care, education, homeless housing and more. The state’s unemployment rate hovered above 5% and was among the highest in the nation for most of 2025. U.S. labor market forecasts for next year are mostly gloomy, with economists from jobs website Indeed predicting a possible continuation of what they called a “frozen” labor market. Likewise, Wells Fargo economists said in late November that “a stalled job market” was a factor in slipping consumer confidence. In tech and other industries, the double-edged sword that is the AI boom could continue to be a factor in layoffs. On the immigration front, continued raids could have the greatest impact on the nearly 3.3 million Latino immigrants who make up 16% of the state’s labor force, according to the UCLA Latino Politics & Policy Institute.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/021225_Port-of-LA_JAJ_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

President Trump focused on California first as his administration rolled out its crackdown on unauthorized immigration, sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and carrying out high profile raids throughout the state.


In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.
Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border. 
CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods. 
Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home. 
Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority. 
All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.
A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside. 
A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems. 
Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories. 
2026 outlook: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity. School districts and employers are preparing for more mass removals, while lawmakers are considering new privacy protections.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071025-Camarillo-Raid-LV-CM-19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

Crackdowns on cities’ immigrant-friendly policies. Heightened arrests and, with them, heightened fear. These were just a few of the ways President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push in 2025 played out in New Mexico, a majority-minority border state with the nation’s highest percentage of Hispanics.
New Mexico also pushed back in several ways, joining litigation against Trump’s executive orders  revoking longstanding protections such as birth-right citizenship and cracking down on so-called “sanctuary city” laws. The state’s jails that hold immigrants also continue to face heightened criticism.
Nonetheless, by year’s end, ICE had arrested at least 1,800 people in New Mexico, creating an emptiness that Zoe Bowman, managing attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, feels across the state. 
“They’re clients who are stressed about their wife and children being homeless because they’ve been in detention for several months, and there’s no income for the family anymore,” she said about the immigrants she’s represented all year long. “That’s just a totally different reality.”
See how that new reality played out below in Source New Mexico’s coverage of the most important immigration stories of the year.
A crackdown at the border

Acting U.S. Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison stood alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in mid-April near the Mexican border. As part of Trump’s push to close the border, a land swap converted former federal public lands into a military base with a constant Army presence, and Ellison announced a new criminal charge to arrest people found within the new “National Defense Zone.”
Within days, the US Attorney’s Office announced dozens of charges against people whom prosecutors suspected of crossing the border illegally, though many were later dropped. The rollout of the new zone also came with widespread confusion. Prosecutors were forced to drop several charges because of uncertainty about the new zone’s borders, and ranchers grappled with how to manage grazing leases that turned overnight into an extended military base. 
The new zone remains in effect, along with the new criminal charges, and federal officials have since extended it into Texas. 
In New Mexico, Ellison’s office continued to release regular updates on arrests in the national defense area, even as fewer migrants arrive at the southern border. The latest release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office shows 54 people were arrested in the zone between Dec. 4 and Dec. 19.

Noem on Aug. 19 announced that Border Patrol officials would be tasked with painting the border wall black for two reasons: First, to prevent rust, and second, to burn the skin of anyone trying to climb over during the hot summer months. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office quickly decried the effort as inhumane and emblematic of Trump’s “cruel approach to immigrant enforcement.”
That section of New Mexico’s shared border with Mexico has already seen a sharp spike in immigrant deaths, particularly after the city of El Paso joined Operation Lone Star, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature border mission. 
Between 2022 and 2024, the number of migrant deaths in the New Mexico desert increased exponentially, Source New Mexico and the Texas Tribune reported, peaking at 176 in 2024, a figure that includes deaths due to falls from the wall that DHS began painting black in August. 
A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to Source’s request in December for an update on the agency’s progress painting the wall black.

ICE detention increases, along with scrutiny

As of Nov. 30, 65,735 immigrants were held in ICE custody, the highest number in history. In many states across the country, ICE relies on local jails, including three in New Mexico, to house them. 
The state’s ICE detention facilities in Torrance, Cibola and Otero counties faced growing scrutiny across 2025, especially as the population  of ICE detainees held in them steadily increased.
Despite public pressure, the Legislature did not pass the Immigrant Safety Act, which would have prohibited public entities from contracting with ICE for detention. Sen. Joe Cervantes (D-Las Cruces), chair of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, later suggested he didn’t bring the bill up for a hearing in the session’s final days because it was “not yet ripe.” 
Without a law in place, state lawmakers publicly and privately argued about whether housing ICE detainees in New Mexico is better than housing them elsewhere, and they grappled with the potential loss in jobs and tax revenue for struggling rural communities. 
While the debate is still ongoing in December, Cervantes recently said his mind may be changing on the matter, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has urged lawmakers to consider the bill again in the 2026 legislative session. 
Advocates are expecting her to put the measure on the list of legislation to be considered in the 30-day session, though Michael Coleman, the governor’s  communications director, told Source on Dec. 17 that the governor is still “determining exactly what will and won’t be on the session call.”

ICE arrests — and fear of arrest — skyrocket

In 45 states, ICE immigration arrests more than doubled in the first 10 months of 2025 compared with the same period last year during President Joe Biden’s administration. The percentage of people ICE arrested who had never been charged with a crime also sharply increased this year. 
In New Mexico, ICE arrested about 240 detainees in New Mexico in 2024, according to the Deportation Data Project, a team of researchers and academics that analyzes ICE data. In just the first 10 months of 2025, the agency reported arrests of more than 1,800, a figure that is likely an undercount, according to a project spokesperson.
Among the arrestees here were 48 people “disappeared” in March raids across the state. Then there were the dairy workers at a Lovington dairy farm; probationers who arrived at scheduled check-ins; and two Venezuelan delivery drivers whose families told Source they were left reeling from the violence of the arrests and their loved ones’ sudden disappearances.
Fear of arrests was also widespread, even among those who have lived in the United States since time immemorial. Three days after Trump’s inauguration, the Mescalero Apache president alerted the tribe that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent questioned one of their members. By that point, reports were swirling across Indigenous communities about ICE questioning tribal members, prompting more public warnings from tribal leaders.
States, cities and communities respond

States, cities and community organizations used the courts and their local authority throughout the year to slow or halt Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
In the Roundhouse, as well as churches, hospitals and city halls, New Mexicans mobilized to protect immigrants and fund programs they relied on. 
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez signed onto multiple multi-state lawsuits against Trump’s immigration policies, including seeking to unmask ICE agents, preserve birthright citizenship and ensure the state’s immigrant-friendly policies don’t deprive it of federal funding for crime victims or road repairs. 
The New Mexico Legislature passed laws that allow immigrants to become police officers and to prohibit state employees from providing immigration information to federal authorities. It also convened in October to replace federal funds cut in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” including $12 million in food assistance funds for lawfully permanent residents.
Despite Trump’s threats, cities including Las Cruces, Santa Fe and Albuquerque re-affirmed or maintained their immigrant-friendly policies in a state that’s already “one of the safest places for undocumented immigrants,” according to a University of New Mexico professor who studies the issue.
And immigrant legal advocates and community organizations rallied behind individual New Mexico immigrants caught up in the new ICE dragnet with protests or lawsuits filed on their behalf. 
Community members also showed up in force for Antonio Chairez Rios, a 20-year Albuquerque resident, who walked out of a local ICE facility in June to cheers from protesters who’d been demanding his release for hours.
“I would like to have a chance,” he told the crowd gathered. “Because all my family is from here, my daughters, my grandchildren.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would allow a voter with a disability to have assistance with filling out an absentee ballot.
HB 45, sponsored by Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, would require the Secretary of State to change the absentee ballot application to allow another person to submit the disabled voter’s ballot. On existing absentee ballots, only the voter can submit the ballot except in the case of “medical emergency absentee applications.”
“I’ve had constituents complain to me about not being able to hand deliver an absentee ballot application on behalf of a loved one or a neighbor,” Clarke said in an interview. “ I do believe that state law allows for us to be good Samaritans and to help the disabled with the entire absentee voting process.”

In 2024, Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Culman, passed SB 1, which prohibited any payment for assistance in absentee ballot applications or to “knowingly” provide an absentee ballot with pre-filled information. A group of five non-profit, non-partisan organizations filed a lawsuit against the state, saying that Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act preempts the law.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit deferred its decision on the case to the Alabama Supreme Court, according to a Dec. 15 court filing, due to questions it had about the law.
This is the third session Clarke has filed the bill. Each year Clarke filed the bill, it was not considered in its respective House committee. Clarke said she hopes pre-filing the bill will help move it through, but only about one third of filed bills are passed each year.
“Sometimes a third of those get passed, which means two thirds of them don’t,” Clarke said. “We have to keep trying.”
Because the bill has not been considered in the past, Clarke said she has not heard any specific concerns about it. There is no fiscal note attached to the bill.
“I think that most people probably print the application from the Secretary of State’s website, and so I don’t see this as an additional cost to the state,” she said.
The bill defines disability as it is defined in federal law, as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the applicant.” 
Larry Canada, legal director of the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), said in an interview including the definition strengthens the bill. ADAP is one of the five plaintiffs in the SB 1 lawsuit.
“It’s not a one-size-fits-all,” Canada said. “If you have someone with mobility issues, someone who is blind, for instance, they need assistance, and this defines disability the way the federal government defines it. I think it’s a good step.”
While ADAP is not legally allowed to lobby for policies due to its federal funding, Canada said ADAP’s purpose is to educate those with disabilities on their rights.
“What our concern is, is that people with disabilities are allowed to exercise their constitutional right to vote. To us, it doesn’t matter whether they’re Republican, Democrat, Independent, everyone has a right to vote who is a citizen of this country and in this state with the residency rules that we have for voting,” Canada said. “To us, anything that impedes that is a violation of federal law, period.”
The bill allows a voter with disabilities to be assisted by a designee to fill out the absentee ballot application and ballot, and allows the designee to deliver the application and ballot to the mail or the absentee election manager. 
“It is the humane, considerate, compassionate thing to do is to make it legal for disabled individuals to be able to get the help that they need with returning an absentee election ballot application,” Clarke said. “We should all put ourselves in the shoes of disabled individuals, and do the right thing here.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s gas tax will rise 4.2 cents per gallon on Jan. 1, the rate driven higher by slightly lower fuel use and a 2024 state law that boosted the tax’s collection targets.
The increase will bring total taxes for gasoline to 49.1 cents per gallon and 56.1 cents for diesel.
New Jersey’s fuel taxes adjust automatically to hit revenue targets under a law signed by then-Gov. Chris Christie in 2016. If fuel use — and, therefore, gas tax revenue — falls, the taxes increase. If fuel use rises, they fall.
The taxes’ collections are sent to the state’s transportation trust fund, which pays for road, bridge, and other transportation projects in the state.
Treasury officials project fuel use will decline slightly, falling by 1%, in the current July-to-June fiscal year, but rising revenue targets accounted for a larger share of the new increase.
In 2024, Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation reauthorizing the transportation trust fund. That law also raised the fund’s revenue targets. The trust fund must collect about $2.1 billion from fuel taxes in the current fiscal year, up from just over $2 billion in the prior one.
That target will continue to rise until it nears $2.4 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2028.
As that bill was moving through the Legislature, lawmakers said the increases would raise New Jersey’s gas tax by about 2 cents annually.
New Jersey’s total gas tax rate is made up of two separate taxes. The Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax adjusts automatically and will rise with the new year to 38.6 cents per gallon of gas and to 42.6 cents for diesel.
The Motor Fuels Tax does not adjust automatically and charges 10.5 cents per gallon of gasoline, or 13.5 cents per gallon of diesel.
The increase is the largest since fiscal year 2021, which followed the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that took drivers off the road, raising fuel levies by 9.3 cents, an increase erased by reductions over the two following years.

It’s a change restaurants told lawmakers was needed because of an abundance of fake listings, wherein people impersonate restaurants on a third-party delivery app and sell their own food, often at lower quality and higher prices. Such imposter kitchens — sometimes called “ghost kitchens” — can damage the reputations of restaurants and potentially put people’s health at risk, the restaurants argued.
The new law, passed as Assembly Bill 116 during this year’s regular session, requires food delivery apps to verify that the restaurants they are listing have proper permits with their local health authority.
Unlicensed food establishments caught listing themselves on food delivery apps will be subject to a fine, as will any food delivery apps which don’t remove such listings once they are found to be in violation of the law.
The ghost kitchen crackdown stems from one of the dozens of bills going into effect Thursday.
Nevada looks for way to continue ARPA-funded expansion of rare disease screenings for newborns

Another new law going into effect will support and expand the number of rare diseases that newborns in Nevada are screened for.
Nevada is not currently in alignment with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ accepted national standard for newborn screening. To help get the state there, Senate Bill 348 proposed increasing the fee that hospitals pay the Nevada State Public Health Lab for the screenings. The previous rate had remained unchanged since 2014.
Other health care-related bills going into effect include: Senate Bill 138, which is expected to streamline the process of hospitals enrolling eligible women and babies into Medicaid upon delivery; Assembly Bill 163, which enters Nevada into an interstate compact that allows licensed professional counselors from other states to work here without applying for a separate license; and the “Right to Contraception Act,” which strengthens protections against a state or local government burdening access to contraceptive measures.
Also going into effect:

AI disclosure AB73 requires that campaign advertisements and materials must, in “a clear and conspicuous manner,” disclose if they include images or audio generated by artificial intelligence. State lawmakers unanimously supported the measure during this year’s regular session, but its enactment may undergo further scrutiny in the upcoming year. The Trump administration this month issued an executive order promising a review of all state AI laws.
Language accessibility AB367 strengthens the state’s language access laws for election materials. Ballots and other materials will be required to be available in more languages, including American Sign Language, and the state will be required to establish a toll-free telephone number where people can receive language interpretation for election-related materials.
ID card program AB220 authorizes the Nevada Department of Human Services to establish a program to issue identification cards to Nevadans experiencing homelessness. The department is prohibited from charging a fee to the unhoused for the ID card.
Air quality protections SB260 requires employers to notify workers when air quality is poor and limit outdoor work during dangerous conditions.
Defendants deemed incompetent AB467 expands treatment options for defendants who have been deemed incompetent to stand trial. Specifically, it allows such defendants to be treated at private institutions instead of only at state- or county-run ones, which often have long wait lists.
Foster care kids SB284 puts more parameters on child welfare agencies regarding how they deal with the federal benefits children in the agency receive. Among its provisions are requirements that the child welfare agencies check to see if children are eligible for benefits like Social Security. If they are eligible but not receiving them, the agency must apply for them.

The immortal man – born 1822, the year Jackson was founded – wears a green suit inspired by the city’s flag and takes to the skies in the inaugural issue of Jackson Comics. He fights fire with fire to defend the city from flamethrower-wielding villains who seek the downfall of Jackson. 
“He’s protecting not just the people of Jackson, but also the idea of Jackson,” said Blake Barnes, the writer behind Captain Jackson and the founder of Jackson Comics. “The villains show up in Jackson and they want to just burn the whole place down. They’re like, let’s just start from scratch, let’s burn it all up.” 
Barnes said he wanted readers to be able to imagine their own villains, so he gave the antagonists stormtrooper-esque outfits to mask their identities. 
“But I like to think they’re from Rankin County,” he said jokingly.
Barnes, a Mississippian who has lived in Jackson about five years, wanted to give local writers and artists a space to create comics about their home. Since launching in 2022, he’s published two issues of Jackson Comics so far, featuring short illustrated stories that explore a perennial topic for Mississippi writers – the relationship between the state’s past, present and future. A third installment is due to publish this spring. 
The stories also consider Jackson’s relationship to the state of Mississippi.
“Faulkner was the one who said to understand a place like America you have to first understand a place like Mississippi, and I think it can be said on a smaller note to understand Mississippi you have to understand Jackson,” he said.
When Barnes envisioned Captain Jackson, he knew he wanted the superhero to be a Black man in his mid 40s. He teamed up with local comic book legend Steven Butler, who has drawn for Marvel and DC Comics, to bring the character to the page.
While Jackson is a city so often associated with the issue of access to water, Barnes turned to another key element in Jackson’s past: Fire. He drew inspiration from the dormant volcano beneath Jackson, the Civil War-era moniker “Chimneyville,” a reference to Union troops burning Jackson to the ground, and the fires that so many abandoned homes succumb to today. 
Barnes wanted Captain Jackson to be able to use this element to protect the city. 
A television producer at Mississippi Public Broadcasting, Barnes said he was also inspired by an oft-repeated description of civil rights icon Medgar Evers. 
“We just kept hearing all these people say that Medgar Evers had this fire inside him and he wanted to keep going,” he said. “I liked the idea of fire being a motivator and not necessarily something that was destructive.”
Captain Jackson belongs to the city in more ways than one: When Barnes held an exhibition at the Municipal Art Gallery in October last year, he donated a character sketch, created by Butler, to the city.
For the second issue, Barnes turned the clock forward, curating stories from students of all ages about the future of Mississippi. 
“Most of it was dystopian,” he said. “But they all ended on some good note. … They haven’t lost hope, so that’s good.” 
The stories contain imaginative plots: A bomb has fallen on the state, and a young boy discovers a ragged state flag among the ashes. Magnolia trees come to life and attack. The end times have come, but a biker and the owner of a home cooking restaurant still make conversation over a biscuit. 
For his contribution, Barnes imagined Captain Jackson accompanying a group of students to a museum, where they encounter a man from the future who has traveled back in time to punish people for their historical wrongdoings. 
The villain was inspired by Barnes’ own complicated feelings about Mississippi’s history. He challenged himself to embody that idea in a character. 
“That’s something I have felt for some time,” he said. “We’re always having to pay the dues of people who came before us, and I wish we could just restart with every generation, have it be our own way.” 
But Captain Jackson teaches the students that they can’t change the past. 
“They go off with this idea that they can change the future and that’s really what they have to work for,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12133742/copy-Captain-Jackson-Cover-1.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:11:59.948124

But plenty of issues await lawmakers on Jan. 13. And afterward, we have the possibility of an interesting fall political campaign. Maybe not a competitive one, but better than what we saw four years ago.
Health care: With health care costs rising throughout the country, legislators must address potential premium increases in the Public Education Employee Health Insurance Program (PEEHIP) and the State Employee Health Insurance Program (SEHIP), which provide health insurance for state employees. PEEHIP has requested a $380 million funding boost from the state to avoid premium increases. The State Employees’ Insurance Board has already raised some costs for employees next year. Lawmakers will have to wrestle with how much they want to give to the state agencies as affordability stays on everyone’s minds.
Employee pay raises: Legislators will also be tempted to approve pay raises, especially for teachers next year. That will have to balance against what’s expected to be a merely-OK year for revenue growth, where health care may demand a large portion of any new money.
CHOOSE Act: Republicans in control of the Legislature are fans of the voucher-like program, and approved $180 million for the program last year — $80 million more than they were legally required to.
There will be pressure on lawmakers to increase that still further. Whether fiscal constraints stop them — or whether they simply ignore them — could be the difference in whether legislators in 2027 have additional headaches in the Education Trust Fund. States that have created similar programs, including Arizona, have seen them blow holes in their budgets.
Alabama Democrats: Before Doug Jones entered the gubernatorial contest last month, the Alabama Democratic Party seemed moribund. While Jones isn’t the first Democrat to join the contest, many of those who were in had no experience or no proven record of winning at any level. It wasn’t a good sign for a party that seemed to pick its nominees not by consensus, but by accident.
Jones at minimum has given the faithful a point to rally around. A proven fundraiser and a popular figure among Democrats, the former U.S. senator has seemed to kickstart the minority party’s enthusiasm for next year’s contests. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, came into the lieutenant governor’s race with Jones’ encouragement.
We’ll have a better sense of the party’s prospects when candidate qualifying ends on Jan. 23. Jones can’t do it alone. Democrats will need a strong slate of candidates up and down the ballot. They’ll especially need a solid number of House and Senate nominees to keep local enthusiasm up. If they can do that, and if the national climate continues to lean toward the Democrats, the fall campaign might be interesting.
Alabama Republicans: But it may not change much. Republicans are unlikely to lose their grip on state government next year. Alabama remains a solidly red state. And the Alabama GOP is better organized and better funded than its opponents.
There are potential risks for the GOP, and they’re at the top of the ticket. For better or worse, Republicans have largely fallen in line behind U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville as their gubernatorial nominee. Tuberville has spent much of his term making awful statements about Black Alabamians, immigrants and now Muslims. He hasn’t put residency questions to rest. The senator’s campaign has projected an arrogance about its prospects that won’t be an asset for the party. And Tuberville looks eager to make his campaign a giant culture war offensive, which could backfire if the electorate is more focused on affordability.
But the major interest groups in Montgomery are closing ranks behind GOP candidates, and straight-ticket voting could carry Republicans over any mistakes, as it has in the past.  Democratic turnout will likely be higher than in either 2022 or 2024, but at this point, the party’s best realistic hope is picking up a few seats in the Alabama Legislature.
One thing I’ve learned is that it’s foolish to make predictions in Alabama politics. There will be surprises ahead in 2026. And very likely some unfinished business awaiting next year’s winners in 2027.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alabama-State-Capitol-Nov-14-2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:11:59.948124

(Photo by Hal Bernton)UNION GAP, Wash. — On a chilly fall morning, farmworkers fanned out through an orchard here to pick rose-hued apples from green rows of trees that flank this central Washington valley’s irrigated slopes. 
These Pink Ladies were one of the last varieties to ripen in a harvest season that began in late summer amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. 
Local farmworkers — many of them immigrants without legal status — were on edge, while growers worried the federal deportation push could worsen chronic labor shortages.
In a harvest that stretched from August to early December, federal agents did not make large-scale arrests in workplace raids in the orchards. Instead, as in other parts of the country, people often were targeted as they ventured from their homes to shop or commute.
These tactics added a new element of risk and a big dose of fear to many workers’ lives. Still, most continued to make the daily trip to the orchards, where skilled pickers can make from $20 to more than $40 an hour.
“Everybody has work. They got to pay their bills. So, it makes it hard to not come,” said Raul Arroyo Rosas, a Yakima Valley horticulturist working in the Pink Lady orchard.
Stalled federal legislation
Immigrants not legally authorized to work in the U.S. represent an estimated 40% of the people who help to produce many fruits, vegetables and other labor-intensive crops. 
In central Washington, many arrived decades ago amid earlier waves of illegal immigration, and settled in communities such as Wapato, Granger and Toppenish, providing much of the workforce for an expanding agricultural industry with apple orchards that in 2024  provided nearly 70% of the nation’s crop.
The economic importance of these farmworkers — and their vulnerable legal status — has long been recognized by central Washington Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse. His family’s farm in Sunnyside grows hops, which require a lot of labor to train vines. 
Four times, most recently in May, Newhouse co-sponsored the “Farm Workforce Modernization Act,” which includes a provision that would offer farmworkers a pathway to legal residency in the United States. 
Many farmworkers use fraudulent documents, such as Social Security cards with numbers that belong to other people, to get hired. Many growers and farmers who employ these people do not use E-Verify, an online system that can detect such fraud. The bill Newhouse has supported includes a requirement that this system be used.
Newhouse was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. This has complicated Newhouse’s relationship with the president, who has not endorsed the farm workforce bill. 
Within the Trump administration, farmworker labor policies have been caught up in a broader tug-of-war over immigration. 
Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has continually pushed the Department of Homeland Security to step up deportations of all immigrants who lack legal status, including those in agriculture.
Agricultural representatives, many from staunchly Republican regions such as central Washington, have urged federal officials to forego workplace raids in fields and orchards. And, at times, they appear to have gotten through to Trump. 
“We’re not going to do anything to hurt the farmers, and we’re working on that, and we’re going to be coming out with rules and regulations,” Trump said in an Aug. 5 CNBC news interview in which he called farmworkers “very, very special people.”
But, so far, Trump’s talk has not led to any administration plan to offer a legal path for farmworkers.
And in Congress, Newhouse’s legislation has not made much headway. 
Newhouse announced Dec. 17 he will not seek reelection next year but told reporters he would continue to work on farm labor issues through the end of his term. 
The lack of legislative progress on the bill frustrates Jamie Ortiz, whose husband was arrested in September while on the way to work in a central Washington apple orchard. 
“That would be so awesome if that would have passed,” Ortiz said. “To be able to have your work permit. To be able to work, and not be afraid.”
Many apple growers also are eager to see their workers free from the threat of deportation. They include Aaron Clark, a vice president for Price Warehouse & Cold Storage, a Yakima-based operation that grows fruit on some 3,500 acres, including the Pink Lady orchard near Union Gap. 
“It’s no good for people to live in the shadows. It’s a bad deal,” Clark said. “Everybody understands this system is broken. We just gotta figure out how to get it fixed. But there isn’t the political capital to do it right now.”
Relying on immigrant labor
In the 21st century, the challenges of recruiting U.S. farmworkers have intensified, prompting a shift in Washington and other states to hire more foreign contract workers with short-term H-2A visas who receive free housing while in the United States. 
In 2024, Washington farmers and growers hired nearly 36,000 H-2A workers, up from less than 4,000 in 2011, according to U.S. Labor Department statistics.

In Grant County east of the Columbia River, shortages of domestic workers have intensified amid a surging economy that has offered more employment opportunities, including construction jobs building data centers.
“We can’t get workers to come out,” said Kent Karstetter, grower who operates 450 acres of orchards outside the town of Quincy. “If I didn’t have my guest workers, I would be in big trouble.”
Growers have tagged higher labor costs tied to the H-2A program as part of a broader financial crisis that has been compounded by low prices for their apples. They joined with farmers in other parts of the country to lobby the Trump administration for changes to the H-2A program that would help them cut costs.
In October, Labor Department officials proposed new rules intended to make it easier and less expensive to hire H-2A workers. This plan would also result in a more than $2.4 billion transfer of wealth from agricultural employees to their employers, according to the Labor Department.
The United Farm Workers and others sued in November over the Trump administration’s move, arguing the rules would reduce wages paid to U.S. workers in violation of federal law.
Central Washington’s Yakima County, with a population that is more than 50% Latino, has some of the greatest concentrations of Pacific Northwest farmworkers. That has enabled Clark, the Price Warehouse & Cold Storage field manager, to avoid shifting to H-2A workers. 
This year, the company hired at harvest peak some 600 people for orchard work, largely from the Yakima Valley.
“We decided a long time ago to, you know, to do what we could to kind of keep the money in the community,” Clark said.
During a November visit to the Pink Lady orchards, there were ample workers to keep pace with the harvest. They made repeated passes through each row of trees to pick each apple at its peak color and sweetness.
Through the course of a workday, a picker harvests thousands of apples, filling bin after bin, before finally heading home. 
Rising unease among workers
This year, immigration arrests have added stress for workers.
At the Pink Lady orchard, one was detained after he had left his home, while another had her husband picked up, according to Arroyo Rosas, the foreman at the orchard.
At a nearby orchard, one worker reported his uncle and two cousins were taken away by federal agents during a gas station stop. That worker then decided it was too risky to keep going to the orchard and dropped out of the harvest. And that increased the unease of other crew members.
“They hear rumors — and they are afraid,” said Jaime, a 52-year-old foreman who has been working in orchards since he came to the Yakima Valley from Mexico at the age of 18.

During the past year, central Washington has emerged as a hub of grassroots groups that have organized to help watchdog the movements of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Such activism can hold risks.
Ortiz is the administrator of a Facebook group with some 25,000 followers that posts sightings of immigration authorities in the Yakima Valley. She believes her social media posts drew the attention of federal agents, who then shifted their focus to her husband Jose.
Jose had resided in the U.S. since the age of 19 and was trying to legalize his status, Jamie Ortiz said. 
Jose Ortiz was held at the immigrant detention center in Tacoma for six weeks, then deported. He now resides in Hidalgo, Mexico, and has been banned from entering the United States for the next 20 years. Jamie Ortiz, who still has three children ages 16 to 20 living at home, plans to split her time between Mexico and central Washington, where she has a business marketing seasonal cherries.
Through much of the fall, the pace of immigration arrests increased. 
By late November, about five to 10 people a day were being arrested by ICE agents, compared to one or two a day in late summer, according to David Morales, an attorney who works with the Yakima Immigrant Response Network, which offers support to families dealing with arrests and detentions. That dropped to about three to five arrests a day in December. 
“There’s just been a steady drumbeat, and a lot of people detained are farmworkers,” Morales said.
ICE officials did not respond to an email requesting comment about the pace of arrests in central Washington. 
Some people are so spooked that they have balked at shopping, or even visiting a food bank, fearing federal surveillance. One family even barricaded themselves in their home, according to Noemi Sanchez, a Yakima Valley immigrant rights advocate. 
It can also sting when some commenters on social media sites cheer the arrests and expanded ICE presence.
Amid this turmoil, many Latinos would like growers to be more vocal in offering support for workers, according to immigrant rights advocates.
But for growers, there may be risks to speaking out, said Erik Nicholson, a farm labor consultant. Nicholson said he asked several growers why they had not taken more public stands.
“The response is ‘we do not want to be targeted for retaliation by this administration,’” Nicholson said.
Meanwhile, the immigration arrests continue. 
So, too, does the labor in the orchards. This month, shortly after the harvest was completed, many workers began a marathon of pruning to prepare the apple trees for the next year’s crop.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apple-Harvest-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-29 07:11:44.646943

Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman outside of the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday, June 18, 2025 in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)My Reformer year began when I texted Melissa Hortman to confirm what I’d heard: Minnesota House Democrats would skip the first day of the legislative session, boycotting what they argued was an illegitimate usurpation of power by House Republicans. 
I limited my texts to Hortman, mindful of her time, but she always responded, and always truthfully, and often with a quip that properly put me in my place and made me laugh. I texted her on Jan. 5, a Sunday, and she agreed to talk, but only when the Vikings weren’t playing, so we settled on halftime. I scooped the coming DFL boycott of the House. 
In one of my last exchanges with her, she commented on something I’d written and added:  
“Reading it made me even more eager than I have been to spend the summer dissecting the 2024 election and preparing for 2026…. A Democratic wave is not a forgone conclusion in the 2026 election and will have to be created.”
A colleague and I had a meeting with her on June 12. She was upbeat, self-deprecating and typically frank. 
She and her husband Mark Hortman were killed by a gunman on June 14, the same early morning that Sen. John Hoffman and wife Yvette Hoffman were badly injured by the same gunman, prosecutors say. 
I spent almost no time reflecting on any of it because there was work to do. We had to cover the immediate aftermath, including the manhunt and charges; the candlelight memorial and the Hortmans caskets lying in state at the Capitol. We published what I hope is a political obituary that will serve as a vital rough draft of history. And then I covered the funeral. 
I was in the back row of the Basilica of St. Mary, which gave me an intimate — almost intrusively intimate — view of the Hortman children and the other pallbearers, including Gov. Tim Walz, just as the service was about to begin. As the celebrants quieted and a deathly silence settled over the church, I could suddenly see the anguish of the Hortmans’ family and closest friends so clearly, through the watery lens of tears I’d pridefully resisted to that point. (A personal rule: Never solipsize someone else’s tragedy.) 
I channeled my anger productively, with a column about right-wing influencers who sought to stain her legacy for clicks, and another about Glenn Beck’s right-wing media company giving the alleged killer a platform to spout evil lies. 
The rest of the year featured other horrors: Children were killed at a Mass to start the school year at Annunciation Catholic School. 
A right-wing propagandist unleashed a wave of hatred on Somali Minnesotans.
Sometimes people ask me if we get burned out observing and recording and commenting on so much suffering. Which is a thoughtful question — second-hand trauma is a real thing — but we must also remember that we’re not the ones who sent our kids off to school for the final time. 
Instead, I use these events as fuel. I — like the rest of us — have been given a responsibility. Even if it’s just editing a small nonprofit newsroom, there’s work to be done.

(Photo courtesy the Jennings County Historical Society)When the General Assembly incorporated southeast Indiana’s Town of Vernon in 1851, it granted the community sweeping authority to govern itself. Over the next century-and-a-half, other towns in the state eventually gave that authority back. But Vernon never did.
In a state where every other municipality now operates under uniform state statute, Vernon remains Indiana’s lone charter town, governed by an incorporation act approved on Jan. 22, 1851, when Indiana was barely 35 years into its statehood.
The document serves as a local constitution, spelling out everything from elections and offices to fines, taxes and the powers of town leaders.
Home to fewer than 300 residents, according to the most recent 2020 census, Vernon is Indiana’s smallest county seat by population. The Jennings County town sits just south of the larger city of North Vernon, on a narrow peninsula formed by a bend in the Muscatatuck River. 
It’s one of only a handful of towns in the state to elect a mayor and the only town that elects both a mayor and a town marshal.
The unusual governance of one of the Hoosier State’s smallest communities resurfaced this year at the Statehouse as lawmakers considered a bill that would have shifted town elections to presidential election years. 
The proposal ultimately died — but even if it had advanced, Vernon would have remained untouched, thanks to a special carveout to specifically exempt the town.
Indiana’s last charter town
Long before Indiana standardized municipal government — a process that gradually unfolded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — and in the days predating synchronized election calendars and machine-printed ballots, towns were governed by charters — individual acts of law passed by the General Assembly.
It was a common approach in the 1800s, according to historians and state historical records. Towns, churches and even businesses were often created with legislative approval, each with its own rules.
Vernon’s charter, for example, begins by formally incorporating the town by name, defining its boundaries and declaring its residents “a body corporate and politic” vested with “all the powers and privileges appertaining to bodies corporate and politic with perpetual succession.”
Story continues below.
VernonIndianaCharter21
 
But that system began to unravel later in the 19th century. 
Indiana’s 1851 Constitution — approved just months after Vernon’s charter took effect — curtailed the General Assembly’s ability to pass special laws for individual communities, pushing the state toward uniform municipal statutes instead. Over time, towns relinquished their charters and transitioned to governance under state law.
By the late 20th century, Vernon stood alone.
The reasons for resistance? Historians, lawmakers and local officials say it’s part habit — and part local pride.
Bell and ballot boxes
Under Vernon’s charter, elections are governed not by Indiana’s consolidated election calendar, but rather by the town’s own rules.
The charter calls for the election of a mayor, council members and other officers to two-year terms, held “biennially thereafter.” The language predates today’s partisan primaries or uniform state election days now held in May and November. 
The document also specifies who can vote, requires advance public notice of elections and even outlines the hours polls remain open. Per the charter, voting historically took place during a short window that closed at 4 p.m., earlier than modern polling closures closer to 6 p.m.
It further requires either newspaper publication or posted written notices in each of the town’s wards. Although Vernon historically operated with five wards, an ordinance in the early 2010s changed the town’s structure to its current three wards.



And although election practices have evolved, Vernon has preserved many of its older traditions. 
Votes are cast on paper and counted by hand. Ballots are deposited in a wooden box. And when polls officially open, a handheld bell is rung to signal the start of the election.
The charter also allows elections to proceed without partisan primaries, also different from the rest of the state.
The mayor presides over council meetings and casts tie-breaking votes. The council is tasked with passing ordinances governing public safety, nuisances, streets, markets and taxation — as long as those laws are in line with the United States and Indiana constitutions.
The river town’s charter additionally grants authority to the town to “restrain and prevent” livestock from running at large; regulate the speed of railroad trains within town limits; and impose fines for violations ranging from unsafe bridge crossings to misuse of municipal water supplies.
In one section, the charter mandates that town ordinances be published “on the door of the Court House, or at some other public place” —  but nowadays, Vernon’s website makes those publicly available, too.
Why Vernon never gave up its charter
There’s no single explanation as to why Vernon never formally surrendered its charter, but the town’s website boasts that its elections continue to be held “unlike any others in the state.”
According to the town’s historical record, Vernon debated abandoning its charter multiple times over the decades, especially as state law became more standardized and administrative responsibilities grew more complex.
Senate approves scaled-back bill swapping town election years

Each time, however, local leaders and residents chose to retain it, viewing the charter as both a practical governing document and a symbol of the town’s identity.
Election administrators and historians have described Vernon’s system as a “living artifact” of sorts, showcasing how local governments once operated across Indiana.
During the 2025 legislative session, Senate Bill 355, authored by Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, sought to shift town elections to presidential election years. The bill passed the Senate but stalled and later died in the House.
Even so, lawmakers were careful not to disturb local operations in Vernon. The bill explicitly exempted the town, allowing Vernon to keep holding elections under its own rules.
Gaskill emphasized that the exemption was intentional.
“There was no desire on my part to interfere at all with a piece of history that Indiana could be proud of,” he said.

 Court order in favor of states/Permanent injunction

 
Agency dismantling: Rhode Island, et al. v. Trump, IMLS, et al.
This lawsuit was filed to challenge the dismantling of multiple federal agencies — the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. 
A preliminary injunction was granted to the states in May, and in November, the district court granted the states summary judgment and permanently halted the dismantling of these particular agencies. The U.S. Department of Justice had filed an appeal to the preliminary injunction, but voluntarily dismissed that appeal four days after the court order in favor of the states. 
 
Wind energy: New York, et al. v. Trump, USA, Dept. of Interior, et al.
This lawsuit challenged policies by the U.S. Department of the Interior that would halt projects intended to develop wind energy around the U.S., including federal approvals for those projects. 
The states won their case on Dec. 8, after a judge vacated the orders that had been issued by the federal government that were halting the approvals, allowing those approvals to begin again. 
 
Department of Transportation grant stipulations: California, et al. v. U.S. DOT, Duffy, et al.
This case challenged new stipulations added to funding from the Department of Transportation that would impose immigration enforcement actions on grants that otherwise had nothing to do with immigration. 
A preliminary injunction was issued in June, and the issue was closed in November after the U.S. Department of Transportation was permanently enjoined from conditioning federal transportation funding on acceptance of immigration enforcement terms. 
 
Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program: Washington, et al. v. FEMA, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the decision to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) bipartisan Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program (BRIC), which was designed to preemptively assist communities in preparing for natural disasters. 
The court issued a preliminary injunction in August, and in December, the court ruled in favor of the states and stopped FEMA from ending the BRIC program. 
 
Department of Energy funding support: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Energy, Wright, et al.
This case sued the U.S. Department of Energy for a policy shift that would eliminate funding supports for states to cover administrative costs and staffing, which had historically been covered by funding programs. 
The court ruled in November to permanently enjoin the government from implementing those funding rules, and vacated the policy that had sent them in place. 
 
Mental health programs in schools: Washington, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education, McMahon, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the decision by the U.S. Department of Education to cut congressionally approved funding for mental health programs in K-12 schools. 
The court issued a preliminary injunction in October, and the Department of Education filed an appeal of that injunction in November. On Dec. 22, U.S. District Court Judge Kymberly Evanson of the Western District of Washington granted the states’ summary judgment motion and ordered the two sides to meet and agree on a timeline for the Department to make lawful continuation decisions. 
 
 Preliminary injunction/Temporary restraining order

 
Public health grants: Colorado, et al. v. HHS, RFK Jr., et al.
This lawsuit was filed to challenge over $11 billion in cuts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including over $379 million that would go to Michigan. 
A temporary restraining order was issued by a judge in April, and a preliminary injunction was issued in May, halting the federal government’s action. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services filed an appeal in July, but voluntarily rescinded that appeal shortly after. 
 
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education, McMahon, et al.
This lawsuit was filed to prevent the U.S. Department of Education from rescinding an extended deadline for states to access money from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, which was created during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Preliminary injunctions were granted to the states in May and again in June, after the department again tried to move the deadline back. The Department of Education filed for a stay on those injunctions, which was denied, and the department’s appeal was voluntarily dismissed in August. 
 
AmeriCorps: Maryland, et al. v. AmeriCorps, et al
This case challenged the layoffs and cancellations of the majority of AmeriCorps staff and positions, including all of the AmeriCorps positions in Michigan. 
A preliminary injunction in favor of the states was issued in June, which reinstated many of the programs. However, the Office of Management and Budget withheld funding until the OMB was added as an additional defendant in the case. After the states filed for a second injunction against the OMB, the office agreed to fully release previously withheld funds, and states withdrew their second injunction request. 
 
Immigration requirements for safety net: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, et al.
This lawsuit challenged new requirements within the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which would require verification of citizenship or immigration status for individuals before they can access dozens of state safety net programs. 
A preliminary injunction was granted in the case in September — the government appealed that decision, but withdrew the appeal later. Briefings for the court’s final ruling will happen throughout spring 2026. 
 
SNAP data sharing: California, et al. v. USDA, et al.
This case involves proposed data sharing requirements from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, giving data to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, looking for information on SNAP recipients for purposes of immigration enforcement.
The court granted a preliminary injunction that blocked the Department of Agriculture’s demand from states from sharing data on SNAP with DHS and ICE and prevented the department from withholding funding from states that did not comply. 
 
Sexual health education funding: Washington, et al. v. HHS, RFK Jr., et al.
This lawsuit challenged the attempt by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to remove funding from states for teen reproductive and sexual health education programs unless the states removed language that was inclusive of gender identity from the curriculum. 
A preliminary injunction was granted in October, and briefings for the final decision will be scheduled throughout spring 2026. 
 
SNAP funding: Massachusetts, et al. v. USDA
This case challenged the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision not to use contingency funding and other funding sources to continue providing SNAP benefits for the month of November to recipients during the 2025 government shutdown, which stretched from October to mid-November. 
On Nov. 12, the court issued a temporary restraining order and prevented the USDA from taking action against states that had provided full SNAP benefits to recipients in November. Shortly after this, the shutdown ended and SNAP benefits were released. 
 
HUD Continuum of Care: Washington, et al. v. HUD
This case challenged changes to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care grant program, which reduced funding for permanent housing options and imposed ideological barriers on grant recipients, such as barring recipients from acknowledging gender identity. 
A preliminary injunction was granted on Dec. 19, after HUD rescinded the Notice of Funding Opportunity that the states were challenging. 
 
SNAP eligibility: New York, et al. v. USDA
This case sought to overturn a policy from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that would essentially eliminate access to SNAP food assistance benefits for all non-citizens, even certain legal residents who had previously been eligible, such as those with refugee status. 
The court granted a preliminary injunction to the states on Dec. 15, halting the policy. 
 
 Preliminary injunction, under appeal

 
Federal funding to states: New York, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al.
This case was filed to stop a directive from the Office of Management and Budget that sought to halt all disbursement of federal funding to states — which included money for programs like Medicaid as well as public schools and law enforcement. A preliminary injunction was issued on March 6, but a month later, it was ruled that the federal government had not been complying with that injunction specifically in terms of FEMA disaster relief funding. 
The decision on FEMA funding has been appealed, and a decision is forthcoming in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 
Medical research funding: Massachusetts, et al. v. NIH
This lawsuit was filed to challenge the decision to halt billions of dollars in medical research funding at the National Institutes of Health. This included research being conducted at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University. 
A preliminary injunction was issued in March, and in April the federal government appealed that decision. Oral arguments have been held in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 
Election executive action: California, et al. v. Trump, Bondi, et al.
This lawsuit challenged an executive order issued by Trump that would institute sweeping voting restrictions, including proof of citizenship measures and new requirements on ballot counting. 
A preliminary injunction was granted by federal district court in June, and the U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal in July. A motion to dismiss by the federal government was denied by the court in September, and the case is still ongoing. 
 
Dismantling the Department of Health and Human Services: New York, et al. v. RFK Jr., HHS, et al.
The lawsuit challenged the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to fire around 10,000 federal employees and consolidate agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The states were granted a preliminary injunction in July. The Department of Health and Human Services first attempted to vacate the injunction in district court and then appealed the injunction in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, but after the appellate court denied a stay, they withdrew their appeal. However, the department’s motion to dismiss is still open in district court. 
 
FEMA grant stipulations: Illinois, et al. v. FEMA, Homeland Security, et al.
This case challenged new stipulations added to funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that would impose immigration enforcement actions on grants that otherwise had nothing to do with immigration. 
The district court issued a permanent injunction in September, barring the federal government from enforcing the immigration enforcement term in the agencies’ grants. FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security filed an appeal of that decision in November, which is pending. 
 
Medicaid data transfer: California, et al. v. HHS, RFK Jr., et al.
This case involves proposed data transfer from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, specifically the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. DHS and ICE sought records of Medicaid beneficiaries for purposes of immigration enforcement. 
A preliminary injunction was granted in August. However, HHS and DHS announced in November that they intended to attempt again to transfer this data, and the states moved for a second injunction against that action. The court extended the first injunction through Jan. 5, 2026, to allow for consideration of that new motion. 
 
Planned Parenthood funding: California, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the “Defund Provision” of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that passed this summer, which would block Medicaid reimbursements for services such as cancer screenings, birth control and STI testing at Planned Parenthood health centers. 
A preliminary injunction was granted to the states on Dec. 2, but the government filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal six days later, which was immediately granted by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which will rule on the motion further. 
 
Appealed
 
Birthright citizenship: New Jersey, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al.
First filed the day after Trump’s inauguration, this lawsuit is challenging an executive order that sought to overturn birthright citizenship. The case alleges a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees birthright citizenship. 
While a preliminary injunction was initially granted, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that federal district courts were limited in their ability to issue a nationwide injunction. The injunction is under appeal, but those proceedings are paused as the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a related case on birthright citizenship, Barbara v. Trump, sometime in 2026. 
 
 Filed

 
Consumer protection: New York, et al. v. Russell T. Vought, et al. 
This case seeks to stop the complete defunding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose current acting director, Russel Vought, is refusing to request any funding from the Federal Reserve, which plaintiffs argue will virtually guarantee the agency runs out of money in January 2026.
The case was filed Dec. 22, 2025  in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon.
 
Title VI: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education, McMahon, et al.
This case is challenging the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically in regards to its interpretation of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
The case was filed in April, and briefings are scheduled through spring 2026 with a hearing set on June 4, 2026. 
 
Energy emergency: Washington, et al. v. Trump, et al.
This lawsuit is challenging the Trump administration’s declaration of an “energy emergency,” which has dictated energy policy and prioritized the use of energy sources like coal, oil and gas as opposed to wind, solar and batteries. 
The case was filed in May and remains open. 
 
Agency priorities: New Jersey, et al. v. OMB, et al
This case called into question the legality of the Office of Management and Budget, along with other federal agencies, cancelling grants to states based on shifts in “agency priorities.”
The case is still in court, and briefings were completed on Dec. 5. 
 
Affordable Care Act marketplace: California, et al. v. RFK Jr., et al.
This lawsuit alleged that a new rule established by the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the enrollment for the Affordable Care Act “truncates and eliminates enrollment periods, makes enrollment more difficult, [and] adds eligibility verification requirements,” and as such is against the law.
The states filed for a preliminary injunction, which was denied in October. Briefings for the final ruling on the case will go through spring 2026. 
 
Transgender youth health care: Massachusetts, et al. v. Trump, et al.
This case sued the Trump administration for attempting to restrict access to necessary health care for transgender, intersex, and nonbinary youth, including through threats of criminal prosecution for parents and doctors. 
The case was filed in August.
 
Electric vehicle infrastructure: Washington, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration policy to suspend the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which provided federal funding to states to develop their electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Michigan joined the case on Aug. 1, and oral arguments are expected Jan. 13, 2026. 
 
Solar for All program: Maryland Clean Energy Center v. USA; Arizona, et al. v. EPA
These two lawsuits, one in the Court of Federal Claims and one in U.S. District Court, challenged the cancellation of the Solar For All program, which was intended to provide solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities. 
Both cases were filed in October, and in district court, a hearing for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026. 
 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness program: Massachusetts, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education
This lawsuit challenged new restrictions on eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student loans for government and nonprofit employees after ten years of service. The restrictions would eliminate eligibility for any nonprofit organization that the government deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose.”
The case was filed in November, and briefings are expected through spring 2026.
 
FEMA grants: Michigan, et al. v. Noem
This lawsuit challenged new funding terms for the Emergency Management Performance Grant and the Homeland Security Grant Program, both intended to be used for disaster response and preparedness, to limit direct access to funding by state and local police and emergency personnel — who are the people usually using the money from FEMA. 
The lawsuit was filed in November, and a hearing was held on Dec. 17 on a motion for summary judgment. 
 
H-1B Visas: California, et al. v. Kristi Noem, et al.
This lawsuit argued that a new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions is illegal, which are visas for highly specialized workers such as doctors and researchers. 
The lawsuit was filed in December. 
 
Dismissed
 
DOGE: New Mexico, et al. v. Elon Musk, et al.
This case challenged Elon Musk’s authority, in his role heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to stop federal funding for various programs and eliminate the actions of a number of government agencies. Specifically, the case challenged it on grounds of the constitutional powers of Congress to appropriate money. 
The states voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit on Dec. 15. Though there is not an official reason in the court filings, Bloomberg reported that it was because Musk had left the agency and its work had essentially stopped. 
 
Federal employee layoffs: Maryland, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, et al.
This lawsuit was brought after the decision to institute “Reduction in Force,” or RIF, layoffs in a number of federal agencies that laid off thousands of government employees. The lawsuit stated that, because this would increase unemployment, states would now be required to pay out significantly higher amounts of unemployment benefits and Medicaid. 
The case was dismissed after the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the states did not have standing and did not prove a significant enough harm. 
 
Education Department reduction: New York, et al. v. Linda McMahon, et al.
This lawsuit was filed to challenge what the states alleged to be an attempt to dismantle and eliminate the Department of Education by the Trump administration under Education Secretary Linda McMahon. 
The case was initially granted a preliminary injunction in May, but in July, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in a brief and unsigned order, to overturn that injunction, which eventually led to dismissal of the states’ appeal of that decision and the injunction being vacated in October.  
 
Machine gun conversion devices: New Jersey, et al. v. Bondi, ATF, et al.
This case called into question the policy of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives that included plans to distribute thousands of machine gun conversion devices, which turn semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons. 
The states withdrew their motions after the ATF expressly confirmed to a judge that it would not follow through on that policy. 
 
Education funding freeze: California, et al. v. Linda McMahon, et al.
The lawsuit challenged the Trump administration’s decision to freeze funding to six longstanding programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, which totalled over $6 billion to go to states for education programs. 
Weeks after the case was filed, the administration released the frozen funding. Both sides of the case filed to dismiss the case, after an agreement that the remaining funding for the fiscal year would be released on time, which the court agreed to. 
 
Victims of Crime Act funds: New Jersey, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bondi, et al.
This case challenged new stipulations added to funding intended to be used for the Victims of Crime Act that would impose immigration enforcement actions on grants that otherwise had nothing to do with immigration. 
After this case was filed, the Department of Justice dropped these plans to enact such policies. 
 
Victims of Crime Act grants: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bondi, et al.
This lawsuit challenged new policies on funding from the Victims of Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act that would restrict the use of grant funds to provide some legal services for certain immigrants. 
The case was dismissed after the Department of Justice said that it would not impose the restrictions on grants in question.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1131102011-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 07:11:44.646943

Taking her hand momentarily off the path’s parallel metal railing, she bent down and stuck her fingers in the brown clay.
When they emerged from the rain-laden dirt, her palm had in it a rounded shell fragment from an oyster. She spotted another connecting piece nearby, and her hand returned to the earth. 
“I just walked right by it, and there it was,” the Ripley resident said as she picked up similar shells scattered in the area.

Northeast Mississippi is hundreds of miles away from any ocean waters that could make for a suitable home for an oyster — at least it is right now. But roughly 74 million years ago, when this mollusk may have lived, most of the state was submerged below the present-day Gulf of Mexico.

For the last three decades, the remnants of that time — fossils of shells, shark teeth and other marine life lining the soil surrounding and beneath Twenty Mile Creek — has attracted people from across the country to visit this highway-side land, now known as the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park. Although easily missed by the thousands of daily drivers who cross the bordering U.S. 45 bridge, Browning has played an important role in both science and Mississippi history.
Its unique impact stretches to the present, as it’s the state’s only public park with space dedicated for fossil finding (another is being developed in Columbus and is expected to officially open within the next two years). 
While there aren’t great ways to measure how many people visit this park each year, George Phillips, the paleontology curator at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson, said he believes it brings enough traffic to have a significant positive economic impact on the surrounding towns. He said there are few geologic formations filled with fossils close to earth’s surface  that are as easily accessible by the public. 
“The intersection of all of these things make it so special,” he said. 
During the later parts of the geologic Cretaceous Period, an era starting 145 million years ago and ending with the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs, parts of the state’s northeast corner flip-flopped between being submerged completely underwater and emerging as coastal barrier islands. Scientists believe sharks, sponges and mollusks lived just above where humans would later develop buildings like Tupelo High School and roads like the Natchez Trace Parkway. 
The present-day stretch of Twenty Mile Creek that slices through Browning has steep walls filled with tall grass and other vegetation. Phillips said the upper chalky walls have sediment from the deepest parts of the ocean, and the sandy creekbeds below contain residues of when Browning was part of a barrier island. 
“The sea is waxing and waning,” he said as he pointed to a museum map of Mississippi’s geological history. 
George Phillips, the paleontology curator at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, points out the northeast portion of Mississippi on a map illustrating the state’s geological history.
Eventually, after the Cretaceous Period ended 66 million years ago, the ocean gradually retreated all the way down to the present-day Gulf Coast. But remnants of Northeast Mississippi’s underwater ecosystem stayed in the Appalachian foothills. 
Locals had found some of those time-capsules for decades before the park was ever considered, Phillips said. But their discoveries weren’t always taken seriously. An ABC Evening News clip from 1991 features a man who said others thought he was “loose in the head” when he told them about finding shark teeth there in the 1980s. 
Public perception of the site changed after a 1990 summer construction project. That’s when the former Mississippi State Highway Department, now a part of the Mississippi Department of Transportation, was bulldozing a path through the hills of West Prentiss County to extend U.S. 45.

When the construction crew dug up the area around Twenty Mile Creek, workers uncovered beds filled with fossilized shark teeth and oyster shells, according to a 1992 report from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. The site also preserved evidence of prehistoric bites and borings, two types of remnants scientists broadly call trace fossils. 
That discovery caught the ear of Patsy Johnson, who at the time was an earth science teacher a few miles from the construction site at Booneville High School. She had previously taken a class to dig for dinosaur fossils at another Prentiss County site near Pisgah.
When she heard about the shark and oyster fossil beds, she called her friend, Douglas Fleury. Fleury had helped start a community museum in Corinth years earlier, and in 1990, he was doing entomology education research at the University of Arizona. 
“I said, ‘Fleury, I’ve got a project for us if you will come back and tackle it,’” Johnson said. 
Together, they collaborated to apply for a grant from the National Science Foundation, an organization that had awarded Johnson the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching a few years earlier. Johnson and Fleury hoped funding from the department would let Booneville High School students be some of the first people to excavate the site through a project they called Students Teaching Others Paleontology, or STOP. 
The proposal sought to teach girl students how they could discover and identify fossils in the region. Then, after they gained those skills, they would relay that information to the broader Northeast Mississippi community. 
“We had to prove that we had something that was worthwhile for the students,” Johnson said. 
The federal agency granted the Booneville School District just over $25,000 to do the exploration in the first half of 1991. 
It was the first known National Science Foundation grant awarded to a high school for students to conduct novel research, according to Mississippi Today’s review of the foundation’s award database and annual reports going back to the 1950s. 
Fleury flew from the Sonoran Desert back to Northeast Mississippi for the dig, which took place for about two weeks in the spring of 1991. The state Department of Environmental Quality report says the high school transformed the construction site into “a laboratory of geological education.”

Both boys and girls from Booneville High were ultimately invited to be part of the project, and Fleury said many of them started the dig more focused on staying clean than looking for fossils. That changed after a student found the first big shark tooth fossil.
“Then, the dirt flew everywhere,” Fleury said.
Jennifer Kendrick was a sophomore at Booneville High School that spring, and she was among the students spraying clay in pursuit of shark teeth remains. She said she finished the dig with lots of them.
Kendrick said she’s a natural skeptic who wants to see evidence before jumping to conclusions. That supercharged class field trip was filled with fossilized souvenirs that helped her better understand the underwater past of her hometown. 
“That’s a little bit of proof to show how the earth has changed,” she said. 
The Booneville High School dig added not only to the students’ personal knowledge but also to the scientific canon. One of Kendrick’s classmates, Ginger McAnally, discovered a fossil of an unusual-looking crab. Scientists later determined it was the first known time any person had found a fossil of that particular crab species. 
The first fossil discovered of Tropidicarcinus mcanallyae, a crab from the Cretaceous Period. It was discovered in 1991 at the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park by Ginger McAnally, a Booneville High School student.
Ginger died in a car crash just a few months after her discovery. Since then, the crab species has been named Tropidicarcinus mcanallyae — an ode to its Booneville High School discoverer. It’s one of at least two species discovered and documented around Twenty Mile Creek.
Both of those fossils are now part of the Natural Science Museum’s collection in Jackson and overseen by Phillips, the state paleontologist.
“It’s not just a new species,” he said of Ginger’s discovery. “This is a whole new genus. So that’s kind of a big deal.”
While the Booneville High School dig delayed U.S. 45’s extension, the site was paved shortly afterward. But Johnson, the earth science teacher, found ways to keep future exploration at Twenty Mile Creek alive.

She happened to be friends with Willie Browning, the co-owner of some of the land adjacent to the new road. Johnson remembers asking him whether he might be interested in making a part of this fossil-filled land available to anyone.
“He said, ‘I’ll let you have that little bit of land if you want to make a park out of that,’” she said. 
Four years after the high school dig, she and Fleury helped Prentiss County officially establish the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park in May 1995. 
The land’s former owner died a few months before the park was officially dedicated, but Fleury and Johnson said members of the family were there for the event. 
Before Browning passed, Johnson said she visited him in the hospital, where he was bedridden with pneumonia.
“I said, ‘Mr. Willie, I’m so sorry you’re sick, but it is really a big ordeal about that. You have really done us well,’” she said. 
Since that dedication 30 years ago, Fleury has worked to make sure young people across the country can continue to learn from Prentiss County fossils. He helped get the clay path down to the creek built, was part of constructing additional picnic tables above the creek and wrote an instructional guide for kids at the park. 
He also helps to ensure there are communal sieves and scoops for visitors who want to find new fossils and periodically leads field trips with local elementary and middle school students about the park. 
Handmade scoops and sieves for fossil finding lie on the ground for community use at the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park in Baldwyn, Miss.
Even after decades of mining the site, Fleury said the creek still and always will have lots of prehistoric capsules for people to take home. 
“We will run out of people before we run out of fossils,” he said.
That stewardship for the park has paid dividends for the surrounding community, as it’s become a favorite place for lots of Northeast Mississippians. On a summer afternoon, Browning’s small dirt parking lot can fill up completely with cars and overflow into the nearby side street — vehicles filled with families looking to spend a day on the creek.
It’s the type of day trip Kendrick, the former Booneville High School student, and her two kids took for years. She returned to Prentiss County after attending college in Memphis and Hattiesburg, and she was surprised when she learned people were still finding fossils near where she and her friends did decades earlier.

Kendrick, her son and her daughter would visit the creek a lot when they were younger, where the kids loved to catch frogs and bugs. She said her son, now a freshman at Booneville High School, has always wanted to be a paleontologist, and it was nice to have a place nearby where he could explore that interest. 
It’s also a good way for her to remind her kids of her and her classmates’ roles in Twenty Mile Creek’s history. 
“They tease me about, ‘Were you here when the sharks were here?’” she said.
Byrd McDowell, the Ripley resident at the park that November morning, has similar fond memories of spending summer days at Browning. She and her husband would drive to Browning and watch their five children play in the creek, occasionally wandering off to spots farther up or down the stream where they thought there could be more shark teeth. 
“It gave them something to do without fighting,” she said.
Joanna Byrd McDowell points at the creek of the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park in Baldwyn, Miss., on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. 
That was over a decade ago. Her kids are all adults now, and her husband passed away recently. These days, Byrd McDowell’s relationship with Browning has changed. 
She comes to the park, a place her husband loved, to find peace when she feels stressed by tasks that he used to take care of for her family. 
“He liked to walk around the edges because he didn’t like getting in the water,” she said.  
Sometimes, when Byrd McDowell has felt the need to sleep somewhere away from her house, she’s pulled her car underneath the nearby highway overpass and spent the night camping out. She said the sound of cars driving over the 34-year-old U.S. 45 bridge makes her feel safe.

She said she’s grateful Browning has always provided her with the space she and her family have needed.

The specter of a lengthy court dispute can throw cold water on housing construction. Vermont’s new Act 250 board thinks it can resolve these disputes faster.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Thirty-two new homes will soon be built adjacent to a nature preserve in South Burlington — but only after a drawn-out legal battle launched by neighbors stalled the project for three years. 
Shortly after the developers secured an Act 250 permit for the project next to the Wheeler Nature Park in 2022 — signaling its compliance with Vermont’s development review law — a group of neighbors appealed it. They contended that scenic views of the Green Mountains would be marred by the new homes, and wildlife would be disturbed by the rock blasting needed for construction.

An environmental court judge ruled in favor of the builders. In 2024, the neighbors appealed that decision up to the Vermont Supreme Court, which — after nearly nine months of back-and-forth between the parties — again gave the developer the go-ahead. 
While a relatively small number of permits get challenged like this, just the specter of lengthy litigation can throw cold water on housing construction — a major problem given Vermont’s acute shortage of homes, housing advocates argue. Chris Roy, an attorney with the Burlington firm Downs Rachlin Martin, who represented the landowner JAM Golf, LLC in the South Burlington case, said the prospect of a prolonged tit-for-tat with opponents can steer builders away from taking on projects in the first place.
“If you have organized opposition that is willing to, you know, do it for the long haul, you’re looking at years,” Roy said. “People hear that and, I mean, all predictability is thrown out the window.”
Housing boosters in Vermont point to cases like this one as prime examples of how not-in-my-backyard style legal challenges can hold up badly-needed new housing, sometimes killing projects entirely or adding considerable expense. Lawmakers are now primed to revisit the thorny issue of reforming when and how opponents can appeal new development.
“The fact that our appeals system is so broken is perhaps the largest remaining regulatory barrier to having a housing system that will meet the state’s needs,” said Miro Weinberger, executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, a pro-housing advocacy group.
After largely punting on the issue two years in a row, lawmakers in 2026 will consider ways to speed up the appeals process. They’re looking to a recent report as a starting point for legislation, according to Sen. Alison Clarkson, D-Windsor, who chairs the Senate Committee on Economic Development, Housing and General Affairs.
The Land Use Review Board — the newly-refashioned body that administers Act 250 – authored the report. The board recommends taking Act 250 appeals out of the court system altogether and giving itself the authority to review challenges to projects.
The report argues that the move would help expedite and streamline the appeals process. The board would have more flexibility to limit discovery and back-and-forth between parties, and mandate stricter response timelines, said Land Use Review Board Chair Janet Hurley. It could also prioritize taking up housing-related permits “to address Vermont’s urgent housing needs,” the report says, and could take up challenges to local permits for projects that also see state-level Act 250 pushback.
“We could hopefully get a decision out quicker than the court,” Hurley said.
Kathy Beyer, senior vice president for real estate at Evernorth, the largest nonprofit affordable housing development organization in the state, recently navigated a years-long legal fight over an affordable housing project in Putney brought on by two neighbors. While the courts ultimately sided with the homebuilders, legal fees and rising construction costs added tens of thousands of dollars to the project, according to the developers.
Beyer thinks pivoting appeals from court to the board is worthwhile.
“Given our experience with the length of time the appeals have taken to be resolved in the more judicial process … I think it’s worth giving it a try. I mean, we’ve been talking about this for years,” Beyer said.
Other housing proponents think appeals should remain in the court system, and the state’s efforts should go toward making that process more efficient by setting stricter deadlines and adding staff capacity to move cases along more swiftly.
Some argue that the new Land Use Review Board should focus its efforts on overseeing a major overhaul of Act 250 set in motion last year. And some skeptics think that a politically-appointed board could invite bias.
“You’re going to have the potential for … the tide going in and out as far as who’s on the board over time,” said Roy, the attorney.
Hurley, the board chair, said the board itself is “politically insulated” and noted that the report suggests holding back the transition from the court until 2028, once the board has wrapped up its Act 250 overhaul.
Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, the chair of the housing committee in the House and former dean of Vermont Law and Graduate School, said he has yet to make up his mind on whether appeals should remain in the courts or shift to the board. 
“The one thing that really is clear to me is that, from the point of view of housing, we want a much faster process,” he said. “It’s not a question of nibbling around the edge. It’s really a question of — can we change the system to make it much shorter.”

One indictment, returned Dec. 9, charges 22 people with offenses corresponding to their alleged roles in the conspiracy, including conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank burglary and fraud and related computer activity and conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
A related indictment, returned Oct. 21, charged 32 people, alleging 56 crimes, including one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit bank burglary and computer fraud, 18 counts of bank fraud, 18 counts of bank burglary and 18 counts of damage to computers, Woods’ office said. 
The indictments also allege that the gang Tren de Aragua used jackpotting to steal millions of dollars in the U.S. and transferred the proceeds among its members and associates to conceal the illegally obtained cash.
Tren de Aragua is a Venezuelan gang that started in a prison and has since expanded into Central America and the U.S., including to Texas, New York, Colorado and Wisconsin. 
According to a report from Transparency Venezuela, the group adopted its name between 2013 and 2015 but likely began operations earlier. The group has been accused of human smuggling and other criminal activity that targets migrants, including kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking.

One of the people in indicted was Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, an alleged Tren De Aragua leader and Venezuelan entertainer who was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
OFAC alleged that Navarro helped the notorious head of Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, escape from a prison in Venezuela in 2012, and that others in the network laundered money for Tren de Aragua leaders.  
The U.S. Attorney for Nebraska said the “case demonstrates what state, federal, and local law enforcement officers can accomplish when they fully join forces … [and] TdA members will find no safe harbor in the State of Nebraska.” 
The Justice Department highlighted the indictment in its “Nationwide Crackdown on Tren de Aragua” press release. The announcement cited other indictments in New York, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. 
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a social media post that this is “another recent example of why I believe Nebraska has to do our part, through setting up the ICE Detention Facility in McCook and by sending the Nebraska National Guard and State Patrol to secure our southern border, to help the federal government root out and deport criminal, illegal aliens.” 
President Donald Trump mentioned the gang during the 2024 campaign. It was the group Trump named when calling a Colorado city a “war zone” after online right-wing reports of Venezuelan gangs “taking over” a Colorado apartment complex, which were false and exaggerated. 
The State Department has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization in February. Trump has justified a U.S. military strike on a boat in waters off South America because he said Tren de Aragua operated it. Strikes have continued and face scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists. They told the Associated Press the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and say the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings. 
Woods’ office said the alleged conspiracy developed and deployed a variant of malware known as Ploutus, which was used to hack into ATMs and force ATMs to dispense cash. The malware’s primary purpose was to issue unauthorized commands to the ATM’s cash dispensing module to force withdrawals. 
The conspiracy relied on recruiting several individuals to deploy Ploutus malware nationwide, authorities said. Members of the conspiracy and the gang would travel in groups, using multiple vehicles, to the locations of targeted banks and credit unions, according to Woods’ office. Authorities say the conspiracy members would then split the proceeds into predetermined portions. 
If convicted, the defendants face a maximum term of imprisonment ranging between 20 and 335 years.

(Screenshot of the Oklahoma 988 website)OKLAHOMA CITY — With funding for the Oklahoma mental health crisis hot line set to run out at the end of the budget year, lawmakers will have to determine how to fund 988 this session. 
The program is primarily funded by the state, but federal assistance from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will dry up at the end of the budget year in September, which means Oklahoma will have to fund the full $5.7 million annually to keep the program running. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services said the agency requested funding in its appropriation request, but lawmakers could also weigh other options to fund 988 long term.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 26, there were nearly 57,000 calls and almost 11,000 texts answered in Oklahoma. 
“988 is a valuable resource for all Oklahomans, which is why the ODMHSAS includes 988 as part of its core and essential services,” the agency spokesperson said in a statement. 
Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, previously proposed creating a telecommunications fee, at a cost of 60 cents per phone line per year, to fund 988, but his bill didn’t make it out of a committee. 
At the time, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow said the need was not urgent because funding had not yet dried up. He declined to comment on avenues to fund the program this session and said it was an issue his caucus would be discussing. 
While Alonso-Sandoval said he doesn’t see the telecommunications fee bill moving forward, he said he hopes funding 988 will be a priority for the Legislature. He said that he’ll push for his bill if no other lawmakers are moving legislation forward. 
“We do need to consider having a long term funding mechanism,” he said. “Whether that’s ingraining it within the funds we send to the Department of Mental Health or directing it specifically for 988, I think that’s something that’s good. If we’re willing to do that year by year, I’ll support it every time but I think eventually we want to make sure it’s just baseline funding that goes to this service.”
Rep. Daniel Pae, R-Lawton, chair of the Health and Human Services Oversight Committee, said another option to fund the help line could be creating a revolving fund. A revolving fund is created by lawmakers in state statute to collect funding for a specific purpose, as outlined in the law. 
Pae said an interim study earlier this year provided information about how much 988 has helped Oklahomans, especially in “these tough economic conditions.” 
“I think the justification is there for the program to continue, and the question now is, how do you fund it in a sustainable way,” he said. 
Funding 988 is an “investment,” Pae said, that is cheaper on the front end than paying for emergency care and other resources later on. 
“I’m open to whatever the final path looks like,” he said. “I’m hopeful that we’ll have broad, bipartisan support on the endeavor.”
Pae said freshman lawmaker Rep. Kevin Norwood, R-Owasso, will be taking the lead on a bill to move funding for 988 forward. 
Norwood declined to comment.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)I was disheartened to read that Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt is sending members of the Oklahoma National Guard to Washington, DC , to participate in the federal surge in the nation’s capital. 
What’s being sold  as a public safety initiative is actually a political stunt that trades real solutions for optics and short-term headlines. 
This so-called “mission” reinforces the harmful narrative that DC is inherently unsafe, and that its residents, many of whom are Black and brown, pose a threat. Framing the District as a “federal enclave” in need of protection from its own people undermines local governance and only serves to fuel fear and distrust. 
The decision to send troops without any coordination with local leaders mirrors the same top-down tactics we’ve seen from President Trump’s administration time and again. It’s performative, punitive, and disconnected from the actual data. 
Why is Oklahoma’s National Guard being deployed to a city that is not in crisis?
One of the primary justifications for the surge was a reported uptick in carjackings. What the data show is that carjackings have been falling from their historic peak in mid-year 2023, and even declined the month before the federal surge in August.  Like other cities,  DC  has seen a significant decline in violent crime since the summer of 2023. 
Prior to the surge of federal law enforcement policing DC’s streets, homicides, robberies, and carjackings have all dropped, mirroring national trends. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan organization of public safety experts, reported “a large and unmistakable drop in reported violence” across the District. These gains were not the result of federal deployments and one-off interventions, but of sustained investments in community-based solutions: violence interruption, restorative justice programs, reentry support, and trauma-informed care.
Recent federal actions, including  federal cuts to those exact violence prevention programs that work to reduce crime, have created further instability across DC’s public safety system.  
While a spokesperson for the Governor said the increased deployment of the National Guard was designed to, “protect the federal enclave of DC”, even local law enforcement have warned that prolonged federal occupation could strain police-community relations and divert resources away from serious crime.
At its core, this federal surge is about power. It’s about a presidential administration trying to undermine the will of DC residents through force, nearly 700,000 of whom pay federal and city taxes, serve in the military, and vote in elections, but still have no full representation in Congress. Rather than respond to the needs of the city, federal actors are using DC as a stage to score political points and impose policies that override the will of District voters. 
Do Oklahoma state officials really want to be complicit in a plan that undermines democratic norms, targets immigrants and Black communities, and disrespects local governance principles? Shouldn’t their focus be on meeting the needs and priorities of Oklahoma residents?
When the Oklahoma National Guard is deployed, it should be for genuine emergencies, not manufactured crises. Sustained safety in the District doesn’t come from a show of force, but from investments that support people and address the root causes of crime. 
Residents of Oklahoma deserve to know what their service members are contributing to because the safety of District communities and residents is not it. 
They deserve transparency and accountability from local officials who are sending the National Guard to DC to score political points under the illusion of supporting public safety.

Conservationists decried Trump's policies, while Wyomingites clashed on nuclear manufacturing proposals.
The post Trump’s sweeping energy policies dominated Wyoming energy headlines in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","Wind turbines continued to sprout across Wyoming this year as legacy oil and natural gas industries weathered bumps in the market, uranium mines resumed operations and coal companies held out hope for brighter days.
It was also the year that a vast majority of Wyomingites woke up to climate change, according to a University of Wyoming survey that showed 86% believe it is happening and they are alarmed at what it portends for the state’s scant water resources.
But Wyoming’s most significant energy headlines of 2025 — even beyond the proliferation of data center plans that would double the state’s electrical demand and intense debate over nuclear energy projects — were President Donald Trump’s sweeping, incessant slashing of federal regulations to boost fossil fuels and orders to rebuff renewable energy.
Sweeping federal policy
On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which, among other things, directed federal agencies to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The order also directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to “reconsider” the landmark 2009 endangerment finding that determined greenhouse gases cause harm and compelled past administrations to curb their emissions.

The president tapped Wyoming’s own Cyrus Western, a former Wyoming lawmaker, to lead the EPA’s Region 8 office overseeing much of the Rockies Region, including Wyoming.
“I think President Trump has been really clear that he wants to take a very different direction and work with the states, help encourage industry, but also simultaneously ensuring that the communities do have access to clean water, that their air is clean, that kind of stuff,” Western told WyoFile in March.
The GOP-led Congress followed Trump’s lead in prioritizing fossil fuels in July with provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill that slashed royalty rates for coal, oil and natural gas. While cheered by Wyoming’s extractive industries, WyoFile reported the cuts will choke the flow of federal dollars — a $50 million annual loss for the state on coal royalties alone. 
Still, Trump’s efforts won praise from Wyoming’s congressional delegation and Gov. Mark Gordon, who celebrated the “immediate change in approach” to federal energy policies and described the new direction as “a win for U.S. energy and Wyoming.”

Wyoming conservation groups decried the moves, which included an overhaul of the planning processes for public lands. The sweeping changes, they said, are a threat to the state’s wildlife and an outdoor recreation economy that heavily relies on federal public lands, including the already climate-stressed Red Desert. 
“The Trump administration has obviously led with prioritizing extractive industries over all other uses on public lands,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile in September.
Coal lease flop
Trump’s effort to “unlock” federal coal reserves in Wyoming and Montana failed spectacularly, at the hands of a coal mining company with operations in the Powder River Basin.
Based on the premise that a Biden-era ban on future coal leasing in the region hamstrings a soon-to-be resurrected industry, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management scoured the books for federal coal leases that had gone dormant and could be put up for sale. The agency cleared the decks for a 167 million-ton coal lease auction in Montana for a single, apparent bidder, Navajo Transitional Energy Company. Before that auction took place, the administration announced it would also revive a years-long lingering 441 million-ton federal coal tract in Wyoming for auction — again, enticing the single, apparent bidder NTEC, which had not asked for the opportunity, a company official told WyoFile.

When the Montana federal coal auction came on Oct. 6, NTEC — the lone bidder — offered just $186,000. In 2012, the last time the industry demanded a major federal lease sale in the region, the bid was $1.10 per ton. This time around, NTEC’s fraction-of-a-penny per ton bid spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the 441-million-ton auction scheduled for days later in Wyoming.
“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile.
Despite those results, Wyoming’s congressional delegation in November led an effort to bypass the enshrined public-input process for crafting BLM land management plans by invoking the rarely used Congressional Review Act. The move invalidated the agency’s Wyoming and Montana resource management plans for the sole purpose — according to the delegation — of overturning the ban on future leasing. Trump signed the law in December. 
Nuclear contention
Growing interest in nuclear energy proved particularly divisive in Wyoming.

While the $4 billion Natrium “advanced” nuclear power plant continued construction near Kemmerer and notched permitting milestones — thanks in part to Trump executive orders to fast-track such endeavors — the towns of Bar Nunn and Gillette weighed other high-dollar nuclear proposals.
California-based Radiant Industries both enthralled and alarmed Bar Nunn and Natrona County residents with its proposal to manufacture nuclear microreactors for global deployment. The plan, however, would have required an exception to Wyoming’s partial ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. The issue ignited tensions that drew political divisions and, ultimately, led to Radiant scrapping its Wyoming plans in October.
Longtime U.S. Navy contractor BWXT, meantime, introduced its own plans in Gillette: a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant that does not involve spent nuclear fuel storage. In December, Gordon awarded BWXT a $100 million grant to support the project.

Both proposals came amid intense legislative debate and a Gordon-backed Wyoming-Idaho-Utah alliance to center America’s nuclear energy resurgence in the region.
Climate contention
A whopping 86% of residents (compared to 55% in 2014) believe climate change is happening, University of Wyoming researchers reported. And, researchers said, most respondents didn’t know their neighbors felt the same. 
There was evidence, though, when a crowd of voters in Pinedale booed Rep. Harriet Hageman when she used the phrase “absolutely based on false science” to describe the 2009 endangerment finding — the federal doctrine to combat air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. And when Freedom Caucus members sought to make carbon dioxide great again with a bill to outlaw greenhouse gas reduction efforts, their legislative colleagues shot it down.
In September, Gordon joined top Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C. to celebrate a package of coal industry revival initiatives, including a $625 million spending package to “retrofit” old coal plants. Upon return, WyoFile asked him about the carbon-emission implications of extending the use of coal-burning power plants.He asserted that deploying coal carbon capture technologies is key to addressing greenhouse gas emissions without inflicting too much economic pain, and added, “I think, probably, the answer is fairly clear: There’ll be more CO2 production.”

State lawmakers this year approved plans that could expedite new natural gas plants, catching clean-energy advocates off guard. (Photo courtesy the Integration and Application Network/University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science)In many ways, Maryland climate advocates felt “blindsided” by the 2025 legislative session, says Kim Coble, leader of the state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters.
Spurred by calls and emails from constituents complaining of high power bills, legislative leaders determined that increasing in-state energy generation was the solution, passing proposals to bolster solar panels and battery storage technology. But  they also opened the door for expedited permitting of a new natural gas-fired power plant in Maryland — even though it would likely place the state’s ambitious climate commitments out of reach.
And in October — in response to the legislature’s new energy law — Constellation Energy proposed just that.
“When we would say: ‘How does this match with our climate goals?’” Coble said, “the response you’d get back is: ‘We have to generate more energy.’”
With the 2026 session approaching, climate groups say they are ready for round two. They’re preparing to push hard for bills that will advance solar energy and batteries amid Trump administration attacks that will end key subsidies for renewables in 2026.
And they’re better prepared to play defense, opposing new natural gas generation, and any efforts to mine environmental and energy funds to close another intimidating budget shortfall.
“Climate is going to make a comeback this year in Maryland,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
Climate promises a ‘heavy lift’
Judge denies US Wind request to halt Trump administration attacks

But at least one leading lawmaker, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during a December interview that new natural gas remains on the table.
“We have options that include renewables and natural gas,” Ferguson said. “I think we have to have a really challenging conversation this session about the balance between the aggressiveness of our climate policies and the affordability for everyday Marylanders — and there’s a balance in between.”
Current law requires the state, in just five years, to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels. And nine years from now, Gov. Wes Moore (D) has pledged that the state will use 100% clean energy.
State studies have shown that the two goals are going to be a challenge. A January 2025 report from the Maryland Energy Administration labeled Moore’s clean energy goal “incredibly difficult.” One potential roadmap included a massive 185% increase in nuclear power, along with big increases in solar, onshore and offshore wind.
Paul Pinsky, recently retired director of the Energy Administration, and the architect of the state’s climate mandates, said that both goals will be “a heavy lift.”
“There’s been some retreat, and that’s a problem,” Pinsky said. “We’ve got five years, and we have a fairly significant way to go. So I’m not sure: Are we going to put our shoulders on the grindstone and push forward, or will the government backtrack?”
Part of the problem, Pinsky said, is that no legislators back then expected power demand to rise so precipitously — largely because no one predicted the role of data centers and artificial intelligence.
“We didn’t think or talk about data centers,” said Pinsky, who represented Prince George’s County in the General Assembly for decades before taking over the Energy Administration. “It was not on our radar screen.”
If Pinsky knew then what he knows now, the Climate Solutions Now Act might have looked a bit different, he said.

“I would have said that any data center coming into the state has to bring additional energy, at a minimum — and maybe requiring clean energy,” Pinsky said.
Preventing a solar energy ‘valley of death’
Climate advocates plan to take advantage of the moment to promote renewables in Maryland, especially solar and storage, as Maryland’s offshore wind projects face an unabating assault from the White House.
“Our message to the General Assembly is: You wanted to see what all of the proposals would look like. Now you’re looking at them,” said Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club. “And we think that there’s a strong case that the clean energy and energy efficiency and battery storage options are providing the opportunities that Maryland needs.”
Perhaps aiding advocates’ argument is the fact that Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez has admitted the company’s proposal for a new gas plant in Harford County would be expensive — and likely require state assistance. Getting gas to the site could cost north of $800 million, he told a gathering of legislators in November. The company also offered a battery storage proposal for the expedited consideration before the Public Service Commission.
“We need to kind of make some decisions. We could be a state that has its own natural gas-fired generation, or we can continue to be a state that builds transmission lines in from Pennsylvania,” Dominguez said in November. “The way I feel, I think natural gas ought to be a part of this.”
It’s clear, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery), that gas couldn’t be built in Maryland “without some kind of state support.” But that money is better spent elsewhere, she said.
“Let’s figure out what additional supports are needed, and let’s use that to double down on renewables that are also good for our air, our land, our water and our climate,” she said.
Constellation targets Harford County for new gas plant, but pipeline costs could get in the way

Charkoudian said she is working on a bill that would direct funds that Maryland already collects from energy suppliers (and, by extension, ratepayers) and direct it to the winning bidders in a competitive procurement for new solar energy projects.
Currently, those funds — a specific type of “alternative compliance payments” — go into the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which energy suppliers pay into when they do not meet the state’s renewable energy requirements. There, the funds can be deployed for a variety of uses, including solar projects but also energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households, EV chargers and more.
“Now, we’re taking that money and building solar with it,” Charkoudian said.
Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, formerly the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, said his members, which include solar developers and panel manufacturers, support the delegate’s proposal.
“These projects can come online faster than just about anything else,” he said. “But this is partially to prevent there from being a valley of death for the solar industry with the federal tax incentives going away.”
Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said he is focusing on minimizing “soft costs” for solar developers, particularly given that federal tax credits are set to lapse next summer, after President Donald Trump (R) signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law.
“Every project just went up 30%, with the loss of that federal tax credit, which is concerning,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “We don’t want to lose the solar industry in Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iil-bw-xx-cb-ian-aj-0013_0-1-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

The immigration agents took Khadija’s husband on a Thursday morning earlier this month. He was walking their two boys to school in Memphis.
They had his name and photo on a long list of people the previous government had welcomed into the country a few years before. The new government has changed its mind.
Khadijah’s husband, Qudratullah, begged the agents not to handcuff him in front of his boys, ages 5 and 9. They did it anyway. They took the Afghan national and his boys to a detention center near the airport.
Then they called Khadija and told her to come to the detention center to pick up their sons. When she arrived, they arrested her and took the entire family to a federal detention center in Dilley, Texas.
Khadija wept. “She is crying and screaming all night, every night,” said Latif Salar, pastor of Christ Community Afghan Church in Memphis and Khadija’s brother-in-law.
Salar, who has a Permanent Resident Card, and his wife, a U.S. citizen, speak on the phone to Khadija and her husband every day. “They were just beginning to recover from the trauma of the Taliban. And now this.”
The Trump administration’s campaigns of mass detention and deportation aren’t entirely focused on noncitizens from Latin America.
In late November, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspected shooter of two National Guard officers in Washington, President Trump halted the processing of all immigration applications (including those for asylum) from Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
He ordered ICE agents to “review” the cases of Afghans who entered the country after the 2021 withdrawal of all U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. “We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump said Nov. 28 from his resort in Florida.
A week later, Khadija and her family were arrested and detained.
“I’m a very conservative person, but I don’t understand it,” said Darla Richardson, a Baptist missionary who is trying to help Khadijah’s family and other Afghan refugees who have been detained in Memphis in recent weeks.
“I want the right people coming into our country, but immigration is not a black and white issue. These people were allowed in, they didn’t sneak in.”
Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement immediately responded to inquiries from the Institute for Public Service Reporting requesting details about the detention of Khadija and her family.

In the summer of 2021, the Biden administration evacuated approximately 80,000 Afghans as U.S. troops were being withdrawn after a decade of war.
“I want to thank these brave Afghans for standing with the United States, and today, I am proud to say to them: ‘Welcome home,’” President Joe Biden said.
Two years later, the administration introduced a “Family Reunification for Afghans” program. It allowed Afghans already here to sponsor their family members to come to the U.S. as refugees. Another 120,000 Afghans were permitted to enter the U.S. on “parole” and were shielded from deportation.
The Trump administration eliminated the shield. “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden,” Trump said late last month.
Khadija, her husband and their children came to Memphis in 2023 from Brazil, one of the first nations to offer humanitarian visas for Afghans fleeing the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.
After a long and arduous journey from Brazil, the family used the Biden-era CBP One app to book an appointment at a U.S. border crossing to request asylum.
They were given an electronic I-94 travel document that allowed them to enter and work in the U.S. for up to two years while they applied for asylum. Their immigration court hearing was scheduled for Dec. 26. They were arrested and detained Dec. 4. Richardson said the family has a new court date for Jan. 26 in Texas, but they are having trouble finding an attorney there.
“They came here out of desperation to escape the Taliban,” said Richardson, a compassion ministry catalyst for the North American Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. “They came here with permission. They were following the rules, but the rules keep changing. Now they are one step from being deported, and we know how the Taliban treats women and Christians.”
Khadija and her family are among dozens of Afghan refugees who came to Memphis after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Many are Christian converts and ethnic Hazara, one of the largest ethnic minorities in Afghanistan. In the 1990s, all Hazara groups united with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. Thousands of Hazara were slaughtered.
In 2021, a girls’ school in a predominantly Hazara area of Kabul was bombed by religious extremists. The blast killed 90 and injured 240. Most of the casualties were girls ages 11-15.
“Two years ago, I came to this vast land with a broken heart, a wounded soul, homeless and lost, seeking refuge from the hardships of life,” Jalil Buda, one of the Memphis Afghan refugees, wrote last July on his Facebook page.
“I came from a hell where I still don’t know who is to blame. My body still carries the scent of the blood of those girls and boys whose remains I gathered from the streets and schools. A land that never allowed me to feel even a moment of belonging, where my childhood was riddled with the bullets of violence and humiliation. But America, and its noble people — especially the circle of friends I live among — have given my life meaning in this beautiful land. Their kindness and dignity have made me feel the pulse of life again. For America and all my friends here, I wish nothing but the best.”
Jalil, who says he was beaten by the Taliban for reading a Bible, came to Memphis in 2022 with his younger brother, Halil, to join the Afghan church. They both have CBP One visas and I-94 travel documents.

Their parents and three other siblings haven’t been so fortunate. “They all made it to Brazil but they waited too long to try to come here,” Richardson said. “While they were waiting in Mexico, Donald Trump closed down those programs.”
Richardson said the family was being threatened by Mexican cartels and had nowhere else to go. So, in September, they surrendered to the U.S. Border Patrol and asked for asylum. They were sent to a federal detention center in Laredo, Texas.
The parents and their 7-year-old child were released after 30 days. Richardson and Jalil drove to Laredo to pick them up and bring them back. Jalil’s other brother, Safar, a deaf and mute adult, also was released. But their 21-year-old sister, Sakina, remains in El Valle Detention Facility in Texas. An immigration judge has ordered her to be deported.
“She’s the only one left,” Richardson said. “Why are they doing this? They all are good people. Whatever the current laws and rules say about their legal status, they all are refugees.”
Richardson has spent the past few weeks trying to help Jalil, Khadija and other Afghan refugees.
She works with Refugee Memphis, a local Christian nonprofit that befriends, serves, and prays for and with refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and other places.
Last month, she and Pastor Salar took another Afghan refugee named Ali to the police station in Bartlett to help him pay a ticket for going 10 miles over the speed limit. Ali, a chicken farmer who fled the Taliban, came to Memphis in 2023. The police notified ICE who arrested Ali and sent him to a federal detention center in Louisiana.
“I didn’t intend to do this kind of work. It’s exhausting. But I know what God has done for me,” Richardson said. “God has called me to share the Good News with all the nations, and God has brought all the nations here.”

Last Sunday, Richardson and Salar and all the nations gathered at Second Baptist Church, which once hosted the Afghan congregation.
They sang “Joy to the World” and “What Child is This?” and other songs to celebrate the season.
They heard Bible passages about the light that darkness cannot overcome and a soul that magnifies the Lord.
They told stories about the peace that passes all understanding and faith in things unseen.
They prayed for Latif and his family, Jalil and his family, Khadija and her family.
They heard good news about Ali, who was released from detention in Louisiana two days before. An immigration judge granted him asylum.
“All of these people need the intercession and care of their brothers and sisters in Christ,” Mark Morris, a longtime missionary and founder of Refugee Memphis, told the assembly.
At the end of the service, before he gave the benediction, Rev. Dr. Stephen Cook invited the congregation to join him in signing a letter being sent to elected officials in Memphis and Washington.
“We call upon you to urgently and favorably consider the serious threats our neighbors are facing” if they are deported,” the letter states. “We pray that you will join us in speaking up for and standing with our Afghan neighbors in this time of profound instability and deep fear.”
Cook said the letter isn’t political. It’s Biblical.
“These people are sisters and brothers in the Body of Christ who are here legally and have done everything they are supposed to do. They may die if they are sent back to the place from which they have fled,” Cook said. “As your pastor, I have to say to you that saying nothing and doing nothing in the face of these realities is not an option.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latif-Salar-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 06:12:11.272683

The America250 in Idaho Advisory Council voted on Dec. 19 to authorize spending up to $28,500 to restore the replica LIberty Bell in conjunction with next year’s America250 celebration. Idaho’s bell is a replica of the original Liberty Bell that rang outside of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Idaho’s bell serves as a symbol of the signing of the Declaration of Independence 250 years ago, officials said.

Officials will also seek private fundraising for the project, and any leftover funds available after donations will be reverted back to the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council. 
Idaho received the bell in the 1950s, Idaho State Historical Society Executive Director Janet Gallimore said. 
Plans call for cleaning and repairing the bell, fabricating a new wooden housing and adding additional protective metal at the top and bottom, Gallimore said. 
The America250 in Idaho Advisory Council is planning and promoting celebrations across the state for July 4, 2026 to honor the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Advisory council members said refurbishing Idaho’s replica Liberty Bell as part of the America250 in Idaho celebration is a way to protect the bell and celebrate America’s history. 
The bell was previously restored in 2009 and 2018, Gallimore said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)In 2026, Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell hopes to work with the General Assembly on improving school nutrition, retaining Kentucky Department of Agriculture employees and economic development in the agricultural sector. 
In an end-of-year interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Shell said his “number one priority in the budget cycle” is keeping his department’s employees. His team is still finalizing details on a request to the legislature to improve the department’s salaries, he said. 
“We continue to lose employees to other state government entities. They’re doing the same job here, and they’re leaving and going somewhere else and making more money doing that same job somewhere else — in state government,” Shell said. “Helping retain those employees that do an amazing job for us here at the department, not having to retrain …. is really important in these jobs, and consistencies for the people that we represent, the partners that we have.” 
During the 60-day legislative session that begins Jan. 6, Kentucky lawmakers will draft and pass the next state budget. Shell is working on other budget proposals around his Food is Medicine initiative with the Kentucky Hospital Association, which aims to get more nutritious food in the hands of medical facilities for patients and staff. 
“What we’re looking at is nutrition as a health intervention,” Shell said. “Getting people healthy fresh food on the front end of their problem, post patient care, … looking at chronic illnesses around diabetes, hypertension, blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and seeing those lifestyle changes that we can make through local, healthy, fresh food.” 
One Big Beautiful Bill
Shell said it “remains to be seen” what impact the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress this summer, could have on Kentucky farmers. 
Congress cut the the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, by $187 billion through 2034
“I think that looking at SNAP from a local purchasing standpoint of local foods is extremely important — finding a way to get more of our products in agriculture that qualify (and) are available in places where they are able to put into that system,” he said. 
In Kentucky, the Double Dollars program allows SNAP recipients to shop at farmers markets or other eligible shops and double the purchasing power of that benefit, incentivizing farm-fresh food. 
He wants the state to “maximize those dollars for our local farm community” while simultaneously supporting more nutritious food for vulnerable people.

“Looking around SNAP reforms and ways in which to get local fresh food more available for them, is something that we’re always interested in doing. But I think the impact from … changes that would happen on the federal level, with Medicaid and also with SNAP, is yet to be seen until we get out of this legislative session to see how our state government kind of handles some of that.” 
Congress cut Medicaid spending over 10 years by $880 billion.
Working with foster kids, other youth 
Two of Shell’s children are adopted and he sits on the board of CASA of Lexington. (CASA stands for Court-Appointed Special Advocates.) 
“We’ve got somewhere between 8-9,000 kids in the state of Kentucky that are in the system that … don’t need superheroes. They just need somebody,” Shell said. “They just need someone to show up for them and care about them and really pour into them.” 
As of Dec. 7, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services reported 8,692 children were in out of home placements. 
Because of his passion for child advocacy, Shell is working to connect children with food education in his role as commissioner, he said. 
Last year, the department held its first All in Ag Week, which focused on bringing various agricultural experts into schools to teach youth about food, the business of farming and much more. 
While it’s important to teach kids where food comes from and how food affects the human body, he said, schools also need ways to embed agriculture concepts into normal learning routines to show students the importance of agriculture, both as a career and as a source of sustenance. 
“If they’re teaching math, we want it to be ag math,” Shell said of teachers. “If they’re teaching science, it’s ag science. With reading, it’s ag reading.”   
The department’s two Ag Weeks in 2026 will be March 16-20 and Sept. 21-25. 
On his political future 
Shell, a Republican, was elected agriculture commissioner in 2023. He was previously a state representative. 
“If there was a commissioner of foster and adoption, I’d have probably ran for that instead of commissioner of ag,” Shell joked. “It’s really my first love, but there’s not.” 
Shell said he is “definitely running for reelection” in 2027 and “wishes we didn’t have term limits.” 
“I wish I could do this for the rest of my life.”

Tennessee’s GOP supermajority, following the agenda set by President Donald Trump when he returned to office in January, began the year by quickly focusing on enacting legislation targeting immigrants living in Tennessee without legal status.
By the end of January, Gov. Bill Lee had called a special session that gave fast approval to his immigration agenda, creating a new Tennessee Centralized Immigration Enforcement Division charred with working with, and providing grants to, local law enforcement to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. 
By year’s end, at least 55 sheriff and police agencies had partnered with ICE.
The legislature also passed a law making it a crime for nonprofits and other organizations to provide certain services to immigrants without legal status that is currently being challenged in court.
The most controversial piece of legislation denying immigrant children the right to a public school education was met with protests at the Capitol and pushback from school districts. It failed to pass but is expected to be reconsidered when the legislature reconvenes in January.
Tennessee also saw  increased ICE activity. In May, hundreds of immigrants were detained in raids across Nashville. In September, Trump created the Memphis Safe Task Force bringing more than 1,000 federal and state law enforcement officials to combat crime in the nation’s largest majority Black city. The task force has withheld information and data on immigration arrests but advocates have chronicled hundreds during traffic stops. Detentions of immigrants in traffic court, immigration court, worksites, school zones and church parking lots have been reported by media outlets across the state.

Private-school vouchers pass in 2025
The Tennessee legislature enacted Gov. Bill Lee’s private-school voucher plan in 2025, laying the groundwork for expansion in the coming year amid criticism it is creating an expensive entitlement program.
Despite a lawsuit against diverting public funds to private schools, Lee and key Republican lawmakers plan to put more money into the program in 2026, possibly doubling it.
The state spent $144 million this year on 20,000 vouchers that provide $7,300 for students to attend private schools. In addition, lawmakers provided money for one-time teacher bonuses and funds to offset losses for public school districts whose students transferred to private schools.
A state financial analysis of the program found 66% of the vouchers would go to the students already attending private schools, leading opponents to call it a private-school subsidy. The Department of Education has refused to say how many of those receiving the funds were enrolled in private schools last year.
Tennessee governor to increase private school vouchers based on revenue

Even though this budget year is projected to be the tightest in Lee’s two-term tenure, Lee and legislative leaders such as House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Senate Speaker Randy McNally plan to pour more funds into the program. Sexton wants to double the number of vouchers after the state received 42,000 applications for them this year. Lee and McNally say the number will depend on state revenue.
State law already allows 5,000 vouchers to be added next year if the number of applications reaches at least 75% of the scholarships available the past year. But even that depends on whether lawmakers fund the increase.
The legislature approved the program in narrow votes a year after it stalled because of opposition from rural lawmakers worried that their school districts would lose critical funding.
Dark-money groups, whose donors can remain anonymous, poured millions of dollars into election campaigns for candidates who promised to support Lee’s initiative, enabling him to pick up a couple of pieces of support before he called a special session in January to vote on the measure.
A lawsuit filed against the state claims the voucher program is diverting funds unconstitutionally from public schools. Parents who favor the program recently joined the lawsuit in support of the state, saying it allows them to continue to send their children to a private school of their choice without having to work extra jobs to pay for tuition.

Tennessee soybean farmers are facing a difficult harvest season. Severe weather reduced crop yield, inflation made production more costly and trade negotiations with China, Tennessee’s largest soybean customer, mean prices are too low to profit. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Hard times for farmers
2025 proved to be a trying year for Tennessee farmers.
Weather, tariffs, ongoing inflation and low crop sale prices mean farmers are projected to lose $450 million in Tennessee this year, Gov. Bill Lee reported in December.
Severe weather in West Tennessee this spring flooded fields and disrupted the beginning of the growing season for row crop farmers — particularly those growing soybeans, the state’s top agricultural commodity. 
Struggles stretched into the fall harvest season, as China halted purchases of U.S. exports including soybeans amid tariff negotiations with President Donald Trump. Soybean purchases from China, the largest U.S. soybean export customer, resumed in late November following a trade agreement, but some farmers aren’t convinced that the trade war was worth the result.
Trump’s administration also cut $31.2 million in federal grant funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture for agricultural research. One of the grants affected was a $30 million project aiming to expand markets for climate-smart beef, dairy and small grazing animals across multiple states.
In May, Gov. Bill Lee signed the Farmland Preservation Act, creating a grant fund for farmers who voluntarily choose to seek permanent conservation easements to preserve their farmland.
Residents of rural Middle Tennessee, including farmers, voiced their concerns about rising demand for water and proposed water rate hikes as a task force created by Lee continues working to identify ways to serve the region’s needs while protecting its main water source, the Duck River.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled out a series of relief programs in the fall to help offset farm, forest and livestock losses caused by Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.The USDA also announced $12 billion in payments for farmers throughout the country who were hurt by trade disruption and high costs in the 2025 crop year.

 Surprise special election in Tennessee District 7 took national stage

In early 2024, U.S. Rep. Mark Green announced he would not run for reelection after serving for six years, only to reverse course after being cajoled by President Donald Trump into running for another two-year term. 
Still, voters were surprised when Green, a Republican, announced his resignation — permanently — only six months into the new term, creating a vacancy and a special election that captivated politicos across the nation. 
Soon after Green’s June announcement, the field filled with Republicans and Democrats alikecapitalizing on what are typically low voter turnout elections. 
Democrats viewed the special election as an opportunity to pick up a congressional seat — the party holds only one of Tennessee’s nine, with U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen in the Memphis-based 9th Congressional District.
The Republican field of 11 narrowed to four viable candidates: state Reps. Jody Barrett of Dickson, Gino Bulso of Brentwood, Lee Reeves of Franklin, and first-time candidate Matt Van Epps, a former member of Gov. Bill Lee’s administration. 
After scoring an endorsement from President Donald Trump, Van Epps cruised to a primary victory. 
Four Democrats fought out a tight race, with state Rep. Aftyn Behn of Nashville defeating fellow Reps. Bo Mitchell and Vincent Dixie, both of Nashville, and Nashville businessman Darden Copeland. 
The race morphed into one of national significance after the Nov. 4 elections across the country in which Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, and Mississippi Democrats broke a Republican supermajority legislature. With Republicans holding a narrow margin in the U.S. House, both parties saw the Tennessee race as a crucial opportunity to either hold the majority or tighten it further. 
Millions of dollars poured into the race, and national political figures became involved, with Trump endorsing Van Epps and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stumping for the Republican nominee.  
Two former vice presidents — Al Gore, a native Tennessean, and former Vice President Kamala Harris — weighed in on Behn’s behalf, as did U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and the chairs of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. 
On Dec. 2, Van Epps defeated Behn by nine percentage points, down from the 22 percentage points Green won in 2024. 
Both parties will again eye the District 7 seat during the 2026 midterm elections as they look to make gains.

Colorado's largest remaining coal plant, and the last to be scheduled to retired in 2031, is now surrounded by solar projects. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)When Colorado Democrats took full control of state government nearly seven years ago, one of the party’s top priorities in the General Assembly was the passage of a climate action plan that would commit the state to the ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions recommended by climate scientists.
House Bill 19-1261, signed by Gov. Jared Polis in 2019, marked the first time Colorado had codified greenhouse gas targets in state law — and the end of calendar year 2025 is the deadline to meet the first of the goals, a 26% reduction in statewide emissions compared to 2005 levels.
Colorado will fall short of that goal.
That outcome has been all but certain for the last few years, as the state struggled to achieve the needed cuts, especially when it came to vehicle emissions, and state officials have previously acknowledged their efforts to meet the 2025 goal were at least a year behind schedule. The target slipped further out of reach this year as President Donald Trump’s administration and Republicans in Congress rolled back an array of clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric cars and home heating upgrades.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Still, Colorado’s top energy official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the findings of the state’s latest comprehensive emissions report. Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.
“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview. “What the latest inventory shows is that it basically pushes us back (another) year.”
That means the state now expects to meet its 2025 target — about 103 million tons of carbon emissions, a 26% cut from about 140 million tons two decades ago — in 2027. Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50% cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the federal government is going to do in the future,” Toor cautioned. “There is a lot more work that we’re going to need to do to make sure that we are accurately capturing the effects of all of the attacks on clean energy … from the Trump administration.”
Colorado’s approach
Climate scientists have warned that to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, governments around the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.
The world is badly off track to meet those targets. While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.
Colorado’s emissions peaked around 2010 and had declined by about 16% from 2005 levels as of 2023, the latest year for which historical estimates are available, according to the new inventory.
Polis’ administration has embraced what it describes as a “whole-of-government approach” to climate action, pursuing a wide range of policies across different emissions sectors and regulatory bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Air Quality Control Commission and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission.
That approach hasn’t been without its critics among climate and environmental advocates, who warned as early as 2020 that the state wasn’t doing enough to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals. Advocates have been repeatedly left frustrated by the scope and ambition of the Polis administration’s climate regulations, especially at the AQCC.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, on Dec. 9 announced a climate plan centered on a “cap-and-invest” program, reviving a proposal that some influential advocacy groups had hoped to enact through the AQCC after HB-1261’s passage seven years ago.
A separate report released this month by a coalition of Colorado environmental groups emphasized the need for the state to make “strategic near-term capital investments” to get back on track with its emissions goals.
“Coloradans see the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the form of more intense drought, more frequent wildfires and longer hotter summers,” Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development with Western Resource Advocates, said in a briefing on the new report. “Those impacts translate into real costs, but taking action — enacting forward looking policies to address climate pollution — has benefits for equity, for affordability and for air quality.”

Looman was previously appointed by former President Joe Biden as administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, where she led the federal labor standards enforcement agency from 2021 to 2025. In that role, she prioritized enforcement of minimum wage and overtime protections, combatted child labor exploitation, and addressed the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, according to a news release announcing her appointment. 
“As secretary of labor, Ms. Looman will drive my administration’s mission to equip Virginians with the skills and education they need to build steady, rewarding careers,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
Spanberger also cited Looman’s experience as a member of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, her track record on worker protections, and her background in state, federal and local government affairs. Looman previously served as commissioner of Minnesota’s Department of Commerce and as a senior fellow with the NYU Wagner Labor Initiative, where she focused on developing best practices and support for state and local governments to protect workers’ rights.
In Virginia, Looman will oversee regional, state and federal programs that connect Virginians to skills training and job opportunities. She will also advise Spanberger on labor-related matters and oversee several labor-related state entities, including the Virginia Employment Commission and the Virginia Board of Workforce Development. 
Looman’s appointment marks the 10th cabinet announcement from Spanberger as she prepares to take the helm of state government. Still yet to be named are the secretaries of commerce and trade and education. Spanberger has also created a new cabinet position, the “energy czar,” tasked with addressing electrical grid demand, keeping energy prices low and maintaining the state’s commitment to clean energy goals outlined in the Virginia Clean Economy Act. 
As she prepares to join the cabinet, Looman said she is eager to  “improve economic opportunity and security for Virginia’s workers.”
“I share Gov.-elect Spanberger’s vision that both investing in the creation of good jobs and protecting workers are essential to sustaining the commonwealth’s economic growth and shared prosperity,” Looman said in a statement.

(Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)North Dakota courts this year sided with the state in two civil rights lawsuits challenging sweeping restrictions on abortion and transgender medical care adopted by the Legislature in 2023.
Meanwhile, a district court judge sided with landowners in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law that affects underground carbon storage. Other ongoing cases include a lawsuit from two tribes against the state’s redistricting map, which could get review from the U.S. Supreme Court, and a free speech challenge against a North Dakota law regulating campaign advertisements.
Abortion ruling
North Dakota’s near-total abortion ban survived its review before the North Dakota Supreme Court after the justices failed to reach the supermajority vote required to declare it unconstitutional.
Three of five justices in a November opinion found the law unconstitutionally vague, but a vote of four is needed to strike it down.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

The law makes abortion illegal in all cases except rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy would be considered a serious physical health threat under “reasonable medical judgment.” It was signed by former Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2023 just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down a previous abortion ban.
The decision reversed a fall 2024 district court decision that declared the ban unconstitutionally vague and found that women have a right to seek abortions until the point of fetal viability.
The three justices that found the law unconstitutional were Daniel Crothers, Lisa Fair McEvers and Daniel Narum, a district court judge who sat on the case in place of Douglas Bahr, who recused. Chief Justice Jon Jensen and Justice Jerod Tufte found the law constitutional.
Citing testimony from doctors, Crothers wrote in the majority opinion that the law is too vague for medical professionals to understand how it works. He said this also means the state will not be able to enforce it fairly.
Tufte in his dissenting opinion wrote that the ban is not unconstitutionally vague. He said that plaintiffs argued their case based on hypotheticals could not point to any situations where the law had harmed North Dakotans because of vagueness.
Tufte also noted that when North Dakota adopted its constitution in 1889, abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the life of the mother. He said if North Dakotans want broader protections to abortion access, they need to amend the constitution.
Ban on gender-affirming care for minors
A North Dakota judge this fall found the state’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is constitutional. He found that the state had an interest in passing the law because the science behind gender-affirming care is unsettled and adolescents may not be able to understand the risks.
The law makes it a crime to prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to adolescents to treat gender dysphoria.
Unpacking North Dakota’s gender-affirming care ruling

A group of families with transgender kids and a pediatric endocrinologist filed suit over the ban in 2023, arguing that it infringes on personal autonomy and discriminates on the basis of sex.
Before the case went to trial in January, Lofgren dismissed the transgender teens and their families from the case, finding that they don’t have standing to participate in the suit. That left pediatric endocrinologist Luis Casas as the sole plaintiff.
Some of the kids and their parents still testified during the trial about how gender-affirming care had changed their lives for the better. Casas and other medical experts also testified against the ban.
Expert witnesses for the state, some of which had their credibility disputed in other lawsuits, said that gender-affirming medication has not been proven safe for minors.
The plaintiffs have not said whether they will appeal the ruling to the North Dakota Supreme Court.
Landowner lawsuit
A district court judge earlier this month sided with a landowner group and ruled that a law related to the underground storage of carbon dioxide is unconstitutional. 
The Northwest Landowners Association in 2023 filed a lawsuit against the state of North Dakota and the Industrial Commission, the state agency charged with permitting carbon dioxide storage projects.
The law enabled the Industrial Commission to force landowners to allow carbon dioxide to be stored under their property, without their consent, as long as a company secured permission from the owners of at least 60% of the affected land area.
North Dakota judge rules in favor of landowners, finds law unconstitutional

Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson wrote in his opinion that the law is unconstitutional because it enables a government-authorized taking of property without “just” compensation determined by a jury. In this case, the property is pore space – cavities in underground rock formations where emissions can be trapped.
The decision could have implications for multiple existing and planned carbon dioxide storage projects in the state, including Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed interstate pipeline. Summit’s project would transport emissions from ethanol plants in five states to North Dakota to be injected into the ground at the intersection of Mercer, Morton and Oliver counties. 
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said on Dec. 17 the state is considering whether to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. The state and companies that intervened in the case, including Summit, will have 60 days from the date of the judge’s order to decide whether to appeal. The order has not been issued yet.

Other challenges to state laws
Also in 2025, an appeals court overturned a North Dakota federal court’s decision related to redistricting. A federal judge had previously found that the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the power of Native American voters.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation, and three tribal citizens filed suit over the map in 2022, arguing that the new district lines had caused them to lose representation in the state Legislature.
The tribes officially petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case in September. The court has not made a decision whether to review the lawsuit.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals not only overturned U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte’s decision that sided with the tribes, but it also found that private groups do not have the right to challenge state or local governments over allegedly discriminatory voting practices. The appellate court said only the U.S. Department of Justice can bring such cases. 
The tribes say that if the ruling is allowed to stand, it would not only limit their representation in the North Dakota Legislature but be a detriment to racial equality across all seven states in the 8th Circuit.
The state of North Dakota says its 2021 map is not discriminatory and supports the 8th Circuit’s decision. It has argued that allowing private plaintiffs to bring such lawsuits destabilizes state district maps.
North Dakota tribes officially ask US Supreme Court to review redistricting case

In a separate case, a former North Dakota lawmaker recently sued the state in federal court over a law that makes it a crime to lie or make intentionally misleading statements in political ads, arguing it violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Brandon Prichard, a former state representative who is partly known for his attacks on incumbent Republican lawmakers, claims in the lawsuit that he and his wife have been subject to multiple unfair investigations under the law. The lawsuit names Attorney General Drew Wrigley, Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer as well as the North Dakota Ethics Commission and its executive director, Rebecca Binstock, as defendants. The case is still in its early stages. Some of the defendants have filed motions asking the judge to dismiss the suit.

Most of the time the deliveries aren’t complicated, said Tharp, who works for Pafford Medical Services in Phillips County. But then there are the ones that involve a breech birth or the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby’s neck, raising the stakes for paramedics.
“You’re dealing with the life of a baby and a mother, and that stress level is extremely high,” Tharp said. “You can do everything in the world possible, and it still may not be good enough, and you have to live with that.”
Long distances between hospitals that deliver babies have only been getting longer in recent years due to closures, putting an extra strain on ambulance services that transport these patients. Sometimes, they don’t make it in time and babies are born in ambulances, paramedics around the state say.
“Every time something closes a hospital or [another service] in health care, the ambulance is the safety net for that patient population, and the burden just grows and grows and grows on the ambulance service,” said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer at Pafford, which is based in Hope and serves much of Arkansas and parts of other states.

Only 33 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units. Six maternity wards have closed since 2020, including the ones in Helena-West Helena, Warren and Crossett. Pregnant patients in the Delta and South Arkansas have few options, and most of them involve at least half an hour and sometimes up to an hour and a half on the road.
Columbia County Ambulance Service paramedics have delivered babies in ambulances between Magnolia — where the service is based — and the delivering hospitals in El Dorado and Texarkana, Texas, said owner Amanda Warren-Newton, who is also president of the Arkansas Ambulance Association.
The closest in-state delivering hospital to Helena-West Helena is in Forrest City, and the next-closest delivering hospitals are in Memphis, Tenn. and Clarksdale, Miss.
Tharp and Warren-Newton both noted that many rural Arkansans are low-income and on Medicaid, so their deliveries are not covered by insurance if they have to give birth out of state. Medicaid reimburses ambulance companies at far lower than the actual cost of services, making it financially difficult for paramedics to serve rural areas.
More than half of Arkansas births are covered by Medicaid, according to the Arkansas Department of Human Services.
Rural Arkansans face long ambulance wait times, nationwide study says

Additionally, a 2023 study found that all 75 counties in Arkansas have at least one ambulance desert, meaning it takes paramedics longer than 25 minutes to drive to residences from an ambulance station.
In general, rural emergency services’ preparedness for obstetric services has room to grow, according to a separate study from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study surveyed 51 rural hospital-based emergency rooms and found that 71% of them “managed urgent transports of pregnant or postpartum patients” in 2023.
 Staffing, training and equipment

Tharp and Warren-Newton both said paramedics are trained to deliver babies, but it’s normally supposed to be the last resort. Tharp added that recruiting and retaining new paramedics is difficult because of the stress of the job.
“People that are going into the paramedic [field] now will come in for a few months and say, ‘I’m going into nursing, this is too much,’” he said.
One of the most urgent scenarios paramedics encounter with a patient giving birth is placental abruption. Tharp said this year he has twice witnessed this situation, in which a patient whose placenta detaches from the uterus needs a blood transfusion and surgery as soon as possible.
“We can put fluids back in them, but fluids do not carry oxygen, so if you’re over 30 minutes out [from a hospital], they can bleed out two liters in no time,” Tharp said.
Ambulance industry leaders are discussing ways paramedics could essentially maintain a blood bank in an ambulance, Warren-Newton said, but blood has a short shelf life, and it would be difficult to store it at the correct temperature.
Tharp said another problem with placental abruption is the Phillips County’s hospital’s lack of an on-site surgeon. Progressive Health of Helena is a rural emergency hospital, meaning it receives more federal funding in exchange for cutting its inpatient services and focusing on emergency and outpatient treatment.










You’re dealing with the life of a baby and a mother, and that stress level is extremely high. You can do everything in the world possible, and it still may not be good enough, and you have to live with that.


– Mike Tharp, a paramedic with Pafford Medical Services in Phillips County


The Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden is considering becoming a rural emergency hospital, which means its labor and delivery unit would no longer have the capacity to provide C-sections, CEO Glenda Harper said in September.
However, Delta Memorial Hospital in Dumas plans to have its revamped labor and delivery unit up and running by the beginning of February, CEO Jeremy Capps said. The hospital hired Nabholz Construction to renovate “an underutilized wing of the hospital” for $2.1 million in order to add five new labor and delivery beds, an obstetric emergency triage center and a nursery, Capps said. Five obstetric and family practice physicians will be serving patients there.
“Delta Memorial is setting itself up to be prepared for the future and have a great labor and delivery place for these oncoming doctors and mothers, filling that need that is hard to find in rural health care,” Capps said.
Magnolia’s hospital doesn’t serve enough patients to support a labor and delivery unit, Warren-Newton said, but UAMS medical professionals visited the Columbia County Ambulance Service earlier this month to train paramedics in dealing with both complicated and uncomplicated labor and delivery scenarios.
What would help paramedics in addition to further training is medical equipment small enough for newborns, such as IV needles and tubes to assist the baby’s breathing, Warren-Newton said.
“We’re being asked to add all these extra services because we’re having to do more than we’ve ever had to do, but so far, there hasn’t been any funding that’s been passed on to us to be able to do that,” she said.

ELKINS, W.Va. – Nearly 40 years later, the memories of the 1985 flood still sit vividly in the minds of West Virginians who lived through it.

Amy Moore, who grew up in Parsons and lived there during the Election Day floods, said she recalls that day like it was yesterday.
“It had been raining, and my dad came home from work and said the streets were flooding in town, which was kind of normal because of drainage problems,” Moore said. “As the water continued to rise, it was around my hips at this point. I started seeing things float by. I saw a house, I saw cows, cars, I saw everything.”
In total, 38 people died in West Virginia from the floods and cost the state roughly $700 million in damages.

Moore’s experience was one of countless stories from the 1985 flood, an event that devastated communities across northern and eastern West Virginia. It was considered a rare 100-year flood at the time, the kind that happens only once in a lifetime. The state has since experienced several major flooding events like it in the decades that followed.
West Virginia has seen major flooding again and again: in 1996, 2001, 2016, 2023 and again this past summer, where intense rainfall overwhelmed drainage systems and turned roads into rivers in areas such as Marion and Ohio counties.
But new climate data suggest the floods happening now are not the same as those in the past and are becoming more frequent.
Nicholas Zegre, a professor of forest hydrology and the director of the mountain hydrology lab at West Virginia University, says the state is becoming both wetter and drier simultaneously, a recipe for newer, more severe precipitation patterns.
“The warmer the air temperature, the (more the) atmosphere expands, the greater the ability for the atmosphere to store water. And so with the increased evaporation from the land surface, there’s more water going into the atmosphere, and more water can be stored,” Zegre said. “So when rainfall does happen, the rainfall is heavier and more extreme. And so what we’re seeing throughout Appalachia, in many parts across the globe, is with a warming atmosphere.”



Parts of the year, the atmosphere is getting drier due to lack of precipitation, and when it does occur, it is heavier and more extreme, Zegre explained.
According to the Climate Link, the amount of rainfall that happens within the first hour of a storm has increased by about 30% during the past 30 years, which has led to more frequent and extreme floods.
According to the Community Risk Assessment Report, West Virginia faces some of the highest flood vulnerability in the nation, with 94% of its 286 communities at significant risk. Repeated flooding can overwhelm a community’s ability to recover, especially in places already dealing with major socio-economic challenges.

But increased rainfall due to a warming climate is not the only issue causing major floods in West Virginia.  Infrastructure across the state was originally designed for these events to occur in the 19th and 20th century, not current climate events and has now become outdated.
“As the climate changes, and as fast as it’s changing, it’s impossible for the infrastructure designed to keep up with those changes,” Zegre said. “Not only is our infrastructure undersized for the kind of rainfall that we are receiving and projected to receive in the future, our residents and our buildings and our businesses and our infrastructure are all along rivers. And so this creates a threat multiplier in the sense of vulnerability to floods.”
West Virginia has about 32,260 miles of rivers and roughly 40,000 stream miles, with most of the state’s urbanized areas being concentrated along major rivers  like the Ohio, Kanawha and Monongahela.
With the sheer amount of outdated infrastructure, replacing or building new infrastructure across the entire state would cost billions of dollars, combined with recent slashes to federal funding regarding flood resilience. According to Zegre,  West Virginians must rely on other ways to be more flood resilient.
“A lot of the work that we do in the mountain hydrology lab is working with communities to become more flood resilient, meaning we know the heavy rainfall and the floods are going to increase there,” Zegre said. “So far as the atmosphere is warming, so far as climate change is happening, rainfall and floods are going to (increase). We know we can’t stop the rain and the floods, the water moving down our mountain slopes. So what can we do?”
Zegre says knowing how to act and prepare for a flooding event is one part of the solution, even if it is unknown if or when a flood will occur. According to Zegre’s research, this means knowing  where to go, how to protect your property and having resources in place — such as flood insurance — for when a flood does happen.
“What we’re seeing from the federal government is divestment in states, not investment,” Zegre said. “Under the current administration, they’re giving less money to states, and so the infrastructure problem will remain, but what we can do is work with communities to prepare and adapt to increases in flooding.”
Travis Blosser
Fairmont City Manager Travis Blosser says outdated infrastructure played a major role in flooding in his city on June 15-16 this year.
“The learning experience from that is that, yes, there are areas inside the city that were not designed to deal with that amount of rainfall in that short of time period. There are several areas that we have honed in on that need to see some additional infrastructure, which that’s going to cost money, and so it’s figuring out where those resources are coming from to be able to mitigate those issues,” Blosser said.
As Zegre explained, floods that once seemed rare are becoming more frequent as increased atmospheric moisture brings heavier rainfall, raising the likelihood of annual flooding in some communities
“[June] was a once in a 1,000 year flood event. The problem is that doesn’t mean that you’re not going to have another one until another 1,000 years from now. We’re seeing these events more and more often,” Blosser said.
Lack of agreement
Beyond infrastructure and rainfall, flood resilience is also shaped by whether communities believe in the causes of the problem at all. Deep divisions over climate change and distrust in institutions can limit public support for adaptation efforts, even as flooding worsens across the state.
“Climate change has become a very controversial topic for lots of different reasons, but when we engage with adults throughout West Virginia, half of that population denies climate change is happening or that it poses a problem for them,” Zegre said. “But, when we have that same conversation with youth and young adults in the state, they say climate change is happening and poses a threat to them and the world they are going to inherit from older generations as they grow up.”
Zegre says his research points to climate change as the cause of increased severe weather events, but in many West Virginia communities, conversations with affected people shut down at the mention of the topic. Instead, Zegre says, he focuses his conversations on people’s real life experiences.
“When you ask people throughout West Virginia about their experiences, what they say is, yes, the rain is getting heavier when it rains. And yes, it seems to be happening more frequently. And yes, it seems like this creek that flows through my property that we have lived in for six generations, never flooded like this. And so when we sidestep the conversation around climate change and really focus on what people are experiencing resoundingly throughout the state, people say, Yes, something has changed, and it’s becoming more intense,” Zegre said.
Blosser says despite disagreements about causes, he has seen firsthand West Virginia communities still come together to support each other in the wake of disaster.

“I was impressed and amazed by the response of our community, but even more so people outside our community that poured in with support, and not just the city of Fairmont. So I mean, I think my biggest takeaway from the entire experience is, number one, we have amazing emergency service personnel and we have an amazing community that responds in times of need,” Blosser said.
Moore says generations later, that has not changed. In 1985, she experienced the same level of community support.
“I think community always helps, especially in West Virginia, because that is just who West Virginians are. They are people who help each other in times of need. Always,” Moore said.
As of now, there are no major plans in place to update or build any new infrastructure across West Virginia.

I started in late May as the Pennsylvania Capital-Star’s first audio reporter, a role focused on expanding on we tell stories through audio, public media station collaborations and more. Right away, I noted the supportive, collaborative team environment. 
I’m grateful for that, how we push one another to be better and having learned so much from watching my colleagues — even after working in journalism for quite some time.  
Here’s some of what stuck out most to me: 
Whitney Downard joined the Cap-Star even more recently, just last month. But she really hit the ground running and got my attention with this story about the Harrisburg-Area Community College faculty strike. 
She flexed her storytelling skills and took extra steps to talk to more sources for a fast, insightful read about a news event that could’ve otherwise been handled with dryish, straightforward coverage. 

Unions are common at Pennsylvania’s community colleges  — but strikes aren’t


I found it somewhat challenging to choose the highlights among Peter Hall’s prolific portfolio. 
But he’s really good at mining court dockets for the most relevant cases, as with his story about allegations that the Washington County prosecutor’s office has been overzealous in its pursuit of the death penalty.
The top line’s fascinating all on its own. But Pete took the opportunity to provide context about the rules for seeking the death penalty, in addition to detailing the cases in question.

Death penalty defenders ask Pa. Supreme Court to rein in Washington County DA


It’s less straightforward, but just as important, to cover what doesn’t happen. Ian Karbal did that with his story about a domestic violence survivor support bill stalled in the state Senate (its companion in the House has since passed and been signed into law). 
Also, his article about William Penn School District getting a $5 million bonus in the state budget built off his similar accountability dive last year into additional allocations to certain school districts. 

State budget sent $5 million to a struggling school district represented by the Pa. House speaker


And as for me, … I most enjoyed collaborating on a multi-media project with our sister outlet Michigan Advance. It dropped in early September. At that point, our states were the only two without a budget of any kind for the current fiscal year (FTR, North Carolina had a partial one in place). So, our editor Tim Lambert shepherded a convening with Advance’s team. 
The resulting project hit some key elements for me. Comparative state policy analysis tends to figure into my reporting process. I generally enjoy collaboration. And I had the opportunity to reconnect with some public finance sources after far too long. 
Plus, the project included multiple audio elements: a feature that incorporated a tongue-in-cheek montage of our governor’s budget negotiation frustrations as well as an animated longform roundtable conversation among Pete, me and the Advance’s Ben Stoltis. 

Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan


Another highlight so far for me was a story that parsed the language in a wrongful conviction compensation bill to show the proposal as written wouldn’t help people as suggested initially.

Pennsylvania’s wrongful conviction bill could leave many behind

In Colorado, the consequences are still unfolding in communities such as El Paso County, often quietly and without recognition. From aging school buildings and municipal structures to legacy industrial sites and military installations, a material once praised for its fire resistance and durability has left behind a longterm public health burden that has never been fully accounted for.
Even though the medical science behind asbestos-related illnesses is well established, the country still lacks a transparent and centralized system that clearly documents where exposure occurred. Instead, the U.S. relies on what can only be described as a “shadow registry” of records scattered across asbestos trust funds, Veterans Affairs archives, and confidential legal settlements.
Without transparency, communities like El Paso County are left without the whole truth they deserve.
Hidden toll of asbestos
A truly public asbestos registry would reveal the full scope of harm caused by corporate negligence and regulatory failure. It would show exactly which job sites, military bases, and public buildings contributed to decades of exposure, including the construction, manufacturing, and public service environments that helped shape Colorado’s growth.
Between 1999 and 2017, Colorado recorded 3,214 asbestos-related deaths, including nearly 600 linked to mesothelioma and 260 to asbestosis. In El Paso County, in the same period, there were almost 400 casualties attributed to asbestos exposure. The county carries a heavy burden due to its deep military presence and rapid mid-century development. Generations of military personnel, maintenance workers, construction crews, and public employees worked in buildings and facilities where asbestos was common, with little to no tracking of their exposure.
Asbestos trust funds were established to compensate victims, but over time, they have become locked vaults of critical information. These records contain the exact data needed to trace where and how people were harmed, yet they remain inaccessible to doctors, researchers and the public. What was meant to serve justice has become a system that protects secrecy instead of public health.
Fragmented shadow registry protects secrets
The country already holds much of the data needed to understand asbestos exposure, but it’s scattered and sealed off. More than 60 asbestos trust funds contain detailed records of contaminated products, job sites, and corporate responsibility, but none of it is publicly accessible. 
At the same time, the VA and the Department of Defense maintain extensive medical records on asbestos-related illnesses among veterans, yet no unified system connects this information. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks cases of secondary exposure, where families fell ill after asbestos fibers were carried home on work clothing. Still, there is no public registry tying these threads together.
In El Paso County, this means that construction workers, mechanics, military families, and public employees who supported the region’s infrastructure and defense missions remain nearly invisible in federal exposure records. Their illnesses are treated individually instead of as part of a larger, recognizable pattern that could drive reform. 
Veterans, workers, and families are the unknown victims
Over 63,000 mesothelioma cases were reported nationwide between 2003 and 2022, and close to one-third of them involve military veterans. That is because many of these heroes worked and lived in installations such as Fort Carson and the Lowry Air Force Base, along with related defense facilities, which relied heavily on asbestos-containing materials for decades.
Colorado is home to more than 340,000 veterans, many of whom were unknowingly exposed to asbestos during their service. A national Mesothelioma Registry managed by the VA and the DoD would allow earlier diagnoses, better tracking, and more consistent compensation for military families.
The same protection should also apply to civilian workers. For decades, construction and industrial workers in El Paso County were exposed without any long-term system to document their risk. A centralized Occupational Exposure Registry led by the CDC could finally resolve this issue.
Families at home were also affected, as they were exposed through contaminated work clothes and deteriorating materials in older homes and schools. Many developed asbestos-related diseases later in life despite never working directly in high-risk environments.
Replacing shadow registry with real accountability
Undoubtedly, the victims of asbestos exposure need transparent databases that can be accessed publicly, not hidden, shadow records. The data already exists across federal agencies. What’s missing is the coordination and political will to connect these systems and open them to scrutiny.
A dedicated Mesothelioma Registry and a National Occupational Exposure Registry, both under NIOSH at the CDC, could bring structure and accountability to a decades-old problem. Releasing historical job and site records without creating new corporate liability could validate that their exposure was real and preventable. 
These tools would provide communities such as El Paso County with the clarity they have been denied for far too long. Workers, veterans, and their families across Colorado deserve more than silence. It’s time to exchange secrecy for truth and honor those who quietly pay the price for America’s industrial and military past.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia could soon learn whether it has secured a coveted federal award from the Rural Health Transformation Fund. 
Dubbed “VA Rural Vitality,” the proposal submitted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration calls for investing $1 billion to address rural health care access challenges and persistent health care disparities across large swaths of the state. 
Outdated technology, provider shortages, long travel times to care and high rates of chronic disease are among the issues the application aims to address. To tackle those challenges, the administration proposes directing any awarded funds into four integrated initiatives it has developed. 
Under an initiative called CareIQ, Virginia would direct $282 million to help localities modernize electronic health records, expand remote care options  for rural patients and support early-stage health technology startups.  
Another initiative, Homegrown Health Heroes, would put $132 million toward funding medical residencies at rural hospitals, expanding  health care apprenticeships and investing in community college programs. The proposal also includes expanding high school pathways into health care professions.  
A third initiative, Connected Care, Closer to Home, would focus on telehealth and mobile health clinics, with a proposed $412 million investment aimed at expanding access through telehealth services and mobile care units. 
The fourth initiative, dubbed Live Well, Together, would support wearable technology for chronic disease management, children’s physical activity initiatives and “food-as-medicine programs,” with a total proposed investment of $124 million. 
If awarded, Virginia would also allocate about $49 million to establish a centralized program management office to oversee grant administration, track data and evaluate progress. 
Regionally-specific ideas for how the funding could be directed also emerged during listening sessions around the state in recent months, as well as proposals submitted to a public email account. 
Those ideas ranged from outfitting EMS trucks in Southwest Virginia with satellite broadband to establishing mobile maternal health clinics for high-risk pregnancies in Southside Virginia, where a growing maternal health care desert exists. 
Screenshot from Virginia’s application materials to the Rural Health Transformation Fund.
“We think we have an opportunity not just to plug a few of the holes, but to transform in a lasting way the rural health care system in this country,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz emphasized on a press call when the applications opened up this fall.
CMS is expected to announce  grant recipients by the end of this year. 
If Virginia’s application is awarded  the full $1 billion it requested, that funding would come from a $10 billion pool available to states this year through the Rural Health Transformation Fund. 
The fund totals $50 billion overall, with $10 billion made available annually over the next five years. It was created during negotiations over Congress’ reconciliation bill passed this summer and has been hailed by President Donald Trump’s administration as a critical investment in rural health care. 
Health officials in former President Joe Biden’s administration, however, have characterized the fund as  a “band-aid” — a measure that could help in the short term but was ultimately a “political solution” aimed at securing passage of the reconciliation bill passed after pushback from Republicans representing states with large Medicaid or rural populations. 
That criticism stems from broader challenges in the reconciliation bill — formally called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act at its time of passage — which include forthcoming adjustments to Medicaid eligibility and hospital funding mechanisms. Those changes are expected to strain hospitals and could lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage. 
Ballad Health government affairs manager Stacy Ely told The Mercury in an interview this summer that the Rural Health Transformation Fund is a “$50 billion plug for a $300 billion hole.”
The hospital chain, which operates in rural parts of Virginia and Tennessee, is bracing for lower profits and shrinking operating margins. At Lee County Community Hospital in Southwest Virginia, for instance, about 20% of patients have private insurance, while the remainder rely on Medicaid or Medicare. Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million Medicaid enrollees, several hundred thousand could be at risk  of losing coverage when eligibility changes take effect.
Those Medicaid provisions were a point of contention for Democratic members of Congress and some Republicans.
U.S. Reps. Jenn Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland County opposed earlier versions of the bill before ultimately voting for it. As Virginia’s application is reviewed by CMS, they joined other Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation in signing a letter backing the state’s proposal. 
Still, the funding could help address long-standing challenges in a state where 60% of localities are considered rural. Residents often face lengthy travel times for preventative or emergency care, limited access to specialists — including in Virginia’s growing maternal health deserts — and heavy reliance on Medicaid at a time when hundreds of thousands could lose coverage.  
As patients and providers brace for insurance disruptions tied to other provisions of the reconciliation bill, Virginia’s network of free clinics is preparing for a surge in patients while seeking additional funding support from the state. 
Efforts to address rural health disparities have already been underway in Virginia through initiatives supported or launched by Youngkin, as well as legislation passed by state lawmakers. 
Last year, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, assembled a bipartisan group of lawmakers to tour rural communities to hear directly from patients and providers. That effort resulted in multiple bills, some of which were approved by the General Assembly and signed into law by Youngkin. 
Virginia is among 16 states that appear to have submitted full applications to CMS for the fund. Because CMS did not publicly disclose all applications, the Kaiser Family Foundation compiled a tracker based on public records requests and states that voluntarily posted materials. Mississippi, Oklahoma and Nebraska have not shared application materials, though KFF reports that most states have at least made portions of their applications available. 
With applications closing in early November, CMS is expected to notify awarded states by Dec. 31.

“Keith Phaneuf knows how money flows through the state government better than most. So when he told me he had a ‘really good’ story about how some colleges had been building up their reserves while asking for more money, I knew it would be an eye-opener. And that it was, especially in that it showed how huge sums of pandemic aid got pushed out the door in Connecticut without strict controls over how it would be spent. Keith’s sharp eye and keen understanding of state finances didn’t just break this story but pointed us to others.”

April 29: How Trump’s coal policies will impact CT, a state with no coal power plants

“There has been no shortage of important news on the environmental/energy front since Donald Trump took up residence in the Oval Office for a second time, so this story by Jan Ellen Spiegel about an issue that, on its face, doesn’t seem to impact Connecticut might seem like a strange pick. But Spiegel does a masterful job explaining  why a state with no operating coal plants is still at risk from Trump’s efforts to revive the U.S. coal industry.”

July 13: In chaos at CT Capitol, two waste haulers found favors

Credit: Dana Edwards / CT Mirror

“One of my favorite stories of 2025 was this story by Mark Pazniokas about how a 77-word amendment quietly inserted into a bill was used to benefit two politically connected waste-hauling companies. The language, which helped advance projects in Wallingford and Torrington, was emailed directly to Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney’s chief of staff, Courtney Cullinan, by an attorney who works closely with Vincent Mauro Jr. — Looney’s longtime political confidant and chair of New Haven’s Democratic Town Committee — who is also in a personal relationship with Cullinan. The amendment was added just hours before final passage, without public debate or disclosure, and no lawmaker has since claimed responsibility for it. The story offers a rare, detailed look at how close personal and professional relationships can provide a privileged channel into the legislative process, allowing targeted interests to shape state law without transparency or accountability.”

Aug. 28: ICE arrests, deportations in CT up sharply in Trump’s second term

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

“Good data journalism isn’t just about understanding the numbers in the story. It’s about finding the story in the data. In this case, Emilia Otte, Sasha Allen and Renata Daou worked together to find the data, identify the story and then tell it brilliantly with easy-to-read graphics and solid reporting. The takeaway: Arrests conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Connecticut had doubled and deportations had tripled since President Donald Trump returned to office. The story detailed the troubles some immigrant families had dealt with during the sweeps and sought out the perspectives of politicians and advocates. It was a thorough and compelling look at the struggles of the immigrant communities in Connecticut.”

Aug. 24: This CT recovery coach could lose his job to federal cuts. What will happen to his clients?

“When reporter Laura Tillman first started reporting this story we thought it was shocking that one recovery coach served people in more than a dozen towns in the Norwich area on his own. Over the months she met with him and spoke to people who said he’d helped them in their recoveries, the situation at the national level began to more urgently threaten the funding for these coaches. I chose this story because it is a great example of a story that begins with an interesting concept and gains even more importance as policies evolve, creating an urgency to let readers know what is ultimately at risk of being lost.”

Oct. 12: In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments

“The global transition to cleaner sources of energy is certainly underway, regardless of the actions of whoever is in the White House. But that transition can meet hurdles when large-scale developments start taking physical form. Individuals and communities who may have once fully supported clean energy, at least in theory, are running into the reality of its presence in their lives. And some folks in Connecticut, a seemly green energy-friendly state, have made a full 180-degree turn. Our energy and environment reporter, John Moritz, visited towns where residents have begun to sour on solar. As one described the change she’s observed, from rolling farmland to fields filled with panels, it can be ‘overwhelming’.”

Nov. 4: In CT, finding candidates to run for local office is getting harder

Credit: Josie Reich / CT Mirror

“This year the national news felt urgent, at times all-consuming. As an editor, I thought readers needed more tangible stories. I grew hungry for reporting about people and communities here in Connecticut that could show how the era-defining shifts — in national policy and norms — were playing out at the local level. In late October our intern, Josie Reich, approached me after attending a press conference about the Secretary of the State’s new civics education initiative. One of the speakers at the event had remarked that fewer people were interested in running for local offices in Connecticut and part of the impetus for creating the educational platform was to provide information to people who might be curious about public service but weren’t sure where to start. For Josie, it was the first part that intrigued her. Why weren’t people running for local office? She only had a few days to report the story — elections were coming up, and her college workload was substantial. But she turned around a piece, which we published on Election Day, that’s both a local story and a timely, national one.”

“The best journalism doesn’t just make us think; it also makes us feel. This story by Ginny Monk about the fate of one Connecticut child caught in the middle of a protracted custody battle between her biological father and her long-time foster parents is an example of the best kind of journalism. Monk, who covers housing and children’s issues, spent years reporting this story and it was the detail and expertise she gleaned from that work that allowed her to deftly weave a complicated story about whether foster parents should have legal standing in court proceedings with the emotional consequences to the human beings at the center of that battle.”

Dec. 14: CT doesn’t regulate homeschooling. Many parents want to keep it that way

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

“In May of this year, as the General Assembly’s 2025 session was reaching its apex, the Capitol grounds and the Legislative Office Building were overtaken for several days by parents and children brandishing signs in support of homeschooling. Connecticut doesn’t regulate homeschooling, nor were lawmakers seriously considering doing so. But in light of tragic reports of young people who had suffered at the hands of parents taking advantage of that lack of oversight, homeschoolers were concerned they’d face consequences for the actions of a small number of bad actors. Emilia Otte was among the reporters on our staff who had to weave their way through those crowds on their way to the Capitol press room, and she was moved by their devotion to the cause. Many of the parents were wary of journalists, but Emilia was persistent in her efforts to get to know them, following up after session and sitting down, face to face, to learn more about their concerns and their educational aspirations for their kids. The result is a deeply reported, sensitive story of a community that feels misunderstood. As lawmakers once again weigh whether to address homeschool regulation in the coming year, Emilia’s piece raises key questions for them to consider.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)December’s semi-annual revenue forecast for Maine’s general fund reported higher-than-expected revenues for the near future, predicting $250 million more over the next two years than the previous forecast. While this is generally welcome news for the state’s finances, a series of budget pressures on the horizon will strain Maine’s ability to support the most vulnerable Mainers and ensure long-term economic success.
Economic uncertainty is growing
While December’s forecast continues a multi-year trend of upward revisions to state revenue, the larger economic picture includes a lot of uncertainty, mainly driven by federal policies.
President Trump’s sweeping tariffs are likely to reduce demand for goods, cutting into sales tax revenue. Mass deportations reduce the labor force and consumer demand. Meanwhile, major federal spending cuts triggered by the Department of Government Efficiency and the Republican megabill passed by Congress in July (HR 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) will take resources away from rural states like Maine.
Making all this worse is the chaotic nature of many of these federal policies, which makes businesses reluctant to invest.
Some economic indicators already point to trouble — nationally, job growth has slowed and the unemployment rate has crept up. In Maine, the unemployment rate remains low, but payroll employment has shrunk for four of the last five months.
Federal policy changes hit Maine’s budget directly
Beyond broader economic risks, HR 1 creates immediate and long-term budget problems for Maine. The law shifts tens of millions of dollars of costs onto Maine’s general fund through cost-shifts and unfair penalties. Some of these costs will hit the state in two to four years, but lawmakers must prepare now to avoid a severe budget crunch in the future.
Legislators will decide whether Maine will conform to federal tax changes in HR 1. In most cases, they should not do so. These conformity measures could cause the state to lose up to $300 million a year in revenue that is vitally needed for other purposes (see my colleague Maura Pillsbury’s part 1 and part 2 tax conformity blogs).
Washington is pulling the rug out from under Mainers
HR 1 also takes away food assistance and health care from tens of thousands of Mainers, leaving people who already have precarious finances vulnerable to rising prices and a weakening job market. Maine doesn’t have to stand by and watch this happen. State lawmakers can take actions to fill the gaps opened by the federal government. To do so, they will need to be prepared to raise additional progressive revenue.
Mainers were already struggling with unmet needs
Even before the recent federal changes, the state budget was failing to fully meet the needs of struggling Mainers. June’s biennial budget failed to fully fund cost-of-living adjustments for care workers, did not commit to continuing the free community college program beyond the high school class of 2026, and underfunded family planning services. What’s more, there are still 176 bills on the Special Appropriations Table, looking for hundreds of millions of dollars annually in additional funding.
Revenue bills provide a way to make real investments in the economy and quality of life for Mainers
Fortunately, lawmakers have already taken steps toward creating additional sustainable and progressive sources of revenue to address the harms coming from Washington and support struggling Mainers. The following bills offer opportunities to tax wealthy corporations and individuals, making our tax code fairer while putting that money to good use:

LD 1089 places a 2% income tax surcharge on incomes over $1 million. Raises $143 million in the next biennium. Passed the Senate, currently in the House.
LD 1879 increases Maine’s top corporate tax rate on profits over $3.5 million from 8.93% to 10%. Raises $100 million over the biennium, of which the general fund would retain $40 million. Passed in the House and Senate.
LD 229 restructures Maine’s income tax brackets to ask more of higher-earning individuals and give a tax cut to Mainers in the middle class.  The current version of the bill would raise $176 million in the next biennium. This version passed the House and the Senate but has been referred back to the taxation committee for revision.

Legislators have a choice in the upcoming legislative session — they can allow President Trump’s policies to harm Mainers and Maine’s economy while billionaires get giant tax breaks, or they can reclaim some of that revenue and put it to work for more financially secure families and a stronger economy. Relying on the projected surplus alone is insufficient and short-sighted.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/maine-house-session-14-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 04:57:26.781194

In case I’m not making myself clear, let me explain the item that made me think about this topic. In my family, it was a baking sheet. Specifically, it was a baking sheet owned by my mother. It looked impossibly old. It wasn’t just black but a motley assortment of burned and scorched colors, each one slightly covering the other in a charred patchwork.
What did we use this baking sheet for? The easier question would have been what didn’t we use this baking sheet for? We made open-face cheese sandwiches. Seasoned steaks. Twice-baked potatoes. Pork chops. Sizzling whole potatoes wrapped in foil jackets.
OK, in retrospect there seem to be a lot of potato-related dishes being made in my family.
I’m not generally a childhood memoir type of writer. I remember certain incidents and images from those years, but I’m not confident enough on my hold of details to reconstruct that entire world for page after page after page. At least not now.
But my goodness, I can remember that baking sheet. I can remember it as clear as day. I can also remember wondering: Why didn’t we just get a new one?
In my own kitchen, there is no dish quite with the dark power of my mother‘s baking sheet. However, we do own a saucepan that has been separated from its fellows and kept serving through the years. It no longer includes a lid. However, the saucepan serves up an array of soups and other concoctions brewed by my son. We also use a tea kettle that I know logically must only be a few years old, but in terms of appearance and sound suggests it came from a magicians’ hut from the middle ages.
Keeping such old items does raise fascinating questions. Such as: What can you expect dishwashing to realistically achieve? What happens after we’ve eaten all the forever chemicals? And, how can metal become transparent?
When we cook, we commune with the past. We think about the food we once ate, the people who taught us how to cook it and who sat alongside us through those years. We don’t just speak to ghosts; we ask them to remind us of recipes and catch us up on gossip from the hereafter.
I like to think that the old pot or pan, the decrepit fork in the back of the drawer, opens these portals between past and present. The item bridges time, exposes the continuum of human and gustatory experience.
Either that or its cheaper to use the old pan than buying a new one. Have you seen how bad inflation is these days?

Starting the conversation earlier on will help to create healthy money habits as they grow, ultimately benefiting their financial future.
To help you get started, here are tips that make it easier for kids of all ages to learn how to save, budget and begin managing their finances more independently:
1. Start the conversation
It’s never too early to start talking about money in a realistic way so kids can understand how it’s used to support your lifestyle and help you achieve your goals and dreams. Begin the conversation in an age-appropriate way that highlights ideas, such as knowing the difference between needs and wants, saving for something special, and tracking the money you earn, as well as the money you spend. For example, young children can understand the idea of saving up money from their allowance or lemonade stand to buy something they want in the future.
2. Take notes and use tools
As your kids get older, explain the budgeting basics – even as simple as listing what you earn and what you spend, so you can ensure you won’t spend more than you have. Any leftover money is best put in savings first, then they can consider working toward items or experiences they might want to buy. There are many budgeting resources out there, so you can find the one that works for you, including budget worksheets to track spending.
3. Get organized and go digital
Financial confidence starts with getting organized. You can find easy-to-use budgeting tools that work for kids and parents both, with different levels of parental oversight and management suitable for different age groups. Whether it’s a first banking account, or an account geared towards a high school or college student, there are multiple options that can help students of various ages with firsthand digital transactions and account balances, assisting with budgeting and saving.
4. Plan for the future
According to Bankrate, 59% of Americans are uncomfortable with the amount of emergency savings they have, and 27% have no emergency fund at all. It’s important for kids of all ages to know that unexpected events in life can happen, so planning ahead may help reduce stress and better cope with whatever may occur. For this reason, building an emergency fund or saving for a rainy day is a crucial skill to learn.
Your kids can start learning and practicing vital money skills now that will stay with them for life, as well as how to use financial tools so they will be able to stay on top of their finances and achieve their goals.

A first-in-the-nation migrant detention center. A visa crackdown from the top down. An artistic visa used by influencers. And torture allegations at “Alligator Alcatraz.”
Here are the top immigration storylines from 2025:
February: A sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill becomes law
Gov. Ron DeSantis in February signed a comprehensive anti-illegal immigration package into law just hours after GOP lawmakers muscled it through the Legislature.
The law, SB-4C, created state-level penalties for entering Florida without proper documents, mandated the death penalty for a non-citizen convicted of a capital crime, nixed in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and demanded that all counties partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
DeSantis signs immigration bills less than an hour after lawmakers passed them



Despite the Legislature’s Republican supermajority, and repeated insistence that all GOP members wanted to carry out newly inaugurated President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, the legislation didn’t have an easy road.
The 2025 session under the leadership of Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Danny Perez, both Republicans, was marked by rare strife between legislative Republicans and the governor, who’d enjoyed vast power over the lawmaking branch throughout his time in office.
But, as DeSantis came off a brutal loss to Trump in Iowa and entered his final years as governor, Florida Republicans began to stray. This was illustrated first when Albritton and Perez unceremoniously adjourned the special session DeSantis called to debate immigration just 15 minutes after it began — killing all of his proposed legislation.
Then, during a second special session, they passed an anti-illegal immigration package called the TRUMP Act. This drew DeSantis’ ire in part because it handed chief immigration authority to the agriculture commissioner, prompting the governor to veto it and call a third special session.
This time, having integrated both the TRUMP Act and DeSantis’ original asks, the governor signed SB-4C into law just hours after it passed both chambers.
April: A U.S. citizen is arrested
Even after his mother begged while a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court, 20-year-old U.S. citizen Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was held for more than 24 hours in Leon County Jail under charges of illegally entering Florida.
Lopez-Gomez, who was born in Grady County, Georgia, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in April during a traffic stop for allegedly being a non-citizen who crossed the state border.


U.S.-born man held for ICE under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

This was false.
Although a Leon County judge examined the birth certificate and declared that she found no probable cause for the charge, made possible by SB-4C passed two months earlier, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because ICE had formally asked the jail to hold him.
ICE is the federal agency in charge of immigration within the United States. Immigration is a federal power, although state and local authorities may assist in detention efforts.
Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in a car pulled over by Florida Highway Patrol for going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone. He was on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.
The provision he was charged under — illegally entering Florida — has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.
June: A federal judge holds James Uthmeier in contempt
For the first time in recent history, a federal judge in June found Florida’s attorney general in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the new state immigration law as illegitimate and unlawful.
Instead of footing James Uthmeier with fines or jail time, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state’s chief legal officer to submit biweekly reports on how many people were being arrested under the immigration law she’d blocked in April. Williams believed it should be zero.
Uthmeier had taken a slightly different view.


Federal judge holds AG James Uthmeier in contempt of court

Days after her initial ruling blocking police and prosecutors from arresting or charging undocumented immigrants for illegally entering the state, Uthmeier mailed letters to law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs. He wrote that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under SB 4C for illegal entry to the state.
Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.
Still, law enforcement carried out arrests after Williams barred them from doing so. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen from Georgia, garnered international attention after it was first reported by the Florida Phoenix.
An investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that police, mostly other troopers, arrested 25 people on April 4, but didn’t find evidence of arrests after April 18. The second date is important because that is when Williams issued a second order clarifying that her suspension of the law applied to cops, which the state argued against, claiming that Uthmeier lacked authority to stop the arrests.
Uthmeier has since appealed the contempt ruling.
July: ‘Alligator Alcatraz’
President Donald Trump made a rare appearance alongside DeSantis and a host of Republican leaders in July to celebrate the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz,” Florida’s sprawling new migrant detention facility in the heart of the Everglades.
Built atop the near-defunct Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, with its 10,000-foot runway and remote location, “Alligator Alcatraz” became the nation’s first state-run detention center.


Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

The federal government will reimburse up to $608 million of costs to construct and maintain the center and its up to 3,000 detainees.
The center quickly drew concerns from environmental activists, human rights groups, and Democrats, worrying that the facility harmed the surrounding fragile ecosystem, provided poor health care, and was operated largely in secrecy.
The Everglades center inspired other state-run centers to crop up nationwide, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer,” Nebraska’s “Cornhusker Clink,” and Louisiana’s “Louisiana Lockup.”
Later, Florida opened the “Deportation Depot” in Baker County and announced plans for a “Panhandle Pokey.”
October: DeSantis asks to “pull the plug” on H-1B visas
DeSantis in October directed Florida’s top higher education board to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers on H-1B visas.
He wanted the Board of Governors to fully “pull the plug” on these visas, which allow foreigners in specialty occupations to temporarily work in the United States.


DeSantis orders Board of Governors to ‘pull the plug’ on H-1B visas in universities

This came a month after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for future H-1B visa applications and amid his administration’s broader efforts to stop illegal immigration and roadblock non-Americans from working in the United States. It signaled Republicans’ push to not only crack down on illegal immigration, but to also stop certain legal immigration avenues.
As of June 30, more than 1,900 Florida employers sponsored more than 7,200 H-1B visa-holders, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There were a total of 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries in the education sphere, with the University of Florida with the most H-1B beneficiaries at 156, followed by the University of Miami with 90 and the University of South Florida with 72.
H1-B visas have become a flashpoint in Republican circles, as party leaders like Trump and DeSantis urge less reliance on foreign labor while others insist that businesses need workers.
November: The visa for extraordinary talent is used by influencers and OnlyFans
The highly exclusive O-1B visa, reserved for foreigners with “extraordinary” artistic talents, has begun to be used by social media influencers, content creators, and even OnlyFans models.
OnlyFans is a pornographic website allowing users to directly engage, pay for, and request photos or videos of sex workers.
In 2018, immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick noticed that a massive influx of overseas social media influencers were trying to obtain these visas. But it wouldn’t be until 2020 that the San Diego attorney was contacted by an OnlyFans model.


The O1 visa is for ‘extraordinary’ talent: Among its users? Influencers and OnlyFans models

At first, he was skeptical.
Then he saw her monthly salary.
“She said, ‘Let me show you the backend of my platform.’ I looked, and she was making $250,000 a month,” Sapochnick told the Florida Phoenix in a zoom interview.
“I was like, oh my god. Okay. I can use that.”
She became Sapochnick’s first OnlyFans client to obtain the O-1B visa. In the next two years, Sapochnick represented influencers from places like China, Russia, and Canada — many of whom were fitness influencers “dabbling” in OnlyFans.
Sapochnick’s story isn’t unique — at least, not anymore. According to five other immigration lawyers across the country who spoke with the Phoenix, the immigration sphere began to slowly shift toward the digital world a decade ago before exploding amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
December: Human rights group alleges torture at Alligator Alcatraz, Krome
Two Florida migrant detention centers may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees, a human rights organization claimed in a December report.
Amnesty International, which operates in 150 countries, alleged in  a 48-page report that the federal Krome North Services Processing Center in Miami and — to a greater degree — the state-run Everglades site the DeSantis administration calls “Alligator Alcatraz” have engaged in practices that could violate international law.


‘Copy of Guantánamo’: Human rights group alleges torture, inhumanity at ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ Krome

Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of extended solitary confinement at Krome, a 2-by-2-foot punishment “box” — compared to a lion’s cage at a circus — complete with shackles in the Everglades, and poor medical conditions at both South Florida centers.
One detainee claimed there was a death at the Everglades site, although it “went unreported” because “there’s no way to know what actually happened to the person because we’re not registered in ICE’s system,” AI said.
The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security deny wrongdoing and the existence of any non-compliant standards at the facilities. They insisted the report was a “fabrication” or a “hoax” that could rile up anti-ICE sentiment.

,Maryland Matters,2025-12-29 02:47:12+00:00,Maryland Matters,Older adults are missing from Maryland’s SNAP conversation,Stephanie Archer-Smith,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/28/older-adults-are-missing-from-marylands-snap-conversation/,"There's been a lot of talk about SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recently, but one voice has been noticeably absent, writes Stephanie Archer-Smith -- the older Maryalnders for whom the program can mean so much.","The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is of critical importance to older Marylanders of limited means who can't always make do when benefits are cut -- but they are often left out of debate over its future. (Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Maryland’s recent efforts to soften the impact of SNAP delays and federal restrictions are important and appreciated.
But this moment exposes a deeper truth we cannot ignore: Older adults are routinely left out of the decisions that shape their lives, even when those decisions determine whether they have enough food to eat.
At Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland, we see the consequences every day. There is a growing gap for homebound aging adults, particularly those ages 55-64. Many live with chronic illness or disability and cannot “make do” when benefits are cut.
Yet they are often absent from policy conversations, even when they are directly affected.
The SNAP reductions make this painfully clear. When benefits drop for older adults, they do not adjust their budgets — they go hungry. They skip meals. They ration medication. They decline. And when they inevitably fall into crisis, the cost shifts to emergency departments, long-term care, and community organizations like ours.
Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland delivers 1.4 million meals each year to homebound, medically fragile older adults. We enter their homes. We see the desperation that rarely shows up in reports.
As Maryland responds to these federal changes, we urge leaders to include older adults from the outset. Supporting home-delivered meals and similar interventions is not optional. It is essential if we want older Marylanders to remain safe, nourished, and living with dignity-rather than becoming invisible casualties of systems not designed with them in mind.

Some of the Mississippi-based photographer's work is being displayed for the first time.,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Seven decades after Rosa Parks was thrust indelibly into American history for refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama, new photos of the Civil Rights Movement icon have been made public for the first time, and they illustrate aspects of her legacy that are often overlooked.
The photos were taken by the late Civil Rights photographer Matt Herron, and they depict Parks at the march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 — a five-day-long, 54-mile trek that is often credited with galvanizing political momentum for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965.
History lessons tend to define Parks by her act of civil disobedience a decade earlier, on Dec. 1, 1955, which launched the Montgomery Bus Boycott. On Dec. 5, some boycott participants and many of the boycott organizers’ descendants gathered to mark 70 years since the 381-day struggle in Alabama’s capital caught national attention, overthrowing racial segregation on public transportation.
The never-before-seen photos were released to the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery on Dec. 4. They were taken a decade after the boycott and are a reminder that her activism began before and extended well beyond her most well-known act of defiance, said Donna Beisel, the museum’s director.
“This is showing who Ms. Parks was, both as a person and as an activist,” Beisel said.
Never printed before
There are plenty of other photos placing Parks among the other Civil Rights icons who attended the march, including some that were taken by Herron. But others were never printed or put on display in any of the photographer’s numerous exhibits and books throughout his lifetime.
Herron moved to Jackson, Mississippi, with his wife and two young children in 1963 after Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated. For the next two years, Herron’s photos captured some of the most notable people and events of that time. But in most of his photos, Herron’s lens was trained on masses of everyday people who empowered Civil Rights leaders to make change.
Herron’s wife, Jeannine Herron, 88, said that the photos going public in December were discovered from a contact sheet housed in a library at Stanford University.

The photos weren’t selected for print at the time because they were blurry or included people whose names weren’t as well known In Parks’ case, the new photos show her sitting among the crowd, looking away from the camera.
Now, Jeannine Herron is joining forces with historians and surviving Civil Rights activists in Alabama to reunite the work with the communities that they depict.
“It’s so important to get that information from history into local people’s understanding of what their families did,” Jeannine Herron said.
A joyous reunion
One of Herron’s most frequent subjects throughout the Selma-to-Montgomery march was a 20-year-old woman from Marion, Alabama, named Doris Wilson. Decades after he captured her as she endured the historic march, he still expressed his desire to reconnect with her.
“I would love to find where she is today,” Herron said in a 2014 interview among Civil Rights activists and journalists who witnessed that transformative period in the Deep South.
Herron died in 2020, before he had the chance to reconnect with Wilson. But on Dec. 4, Wilson joined other residents of Marion, a rural town in the Black Belt of Alabama. Milling around an auditorium in Lincoln Normal School, a college founded by nine formerly enslaved Black people after the Civil War, people looked at black and white photos that Herron took over the years, pointing out familiar faces or backdrops.
Some photos were familiar to the 80-year-old. But others, including ones where she was the subject, Wilson had never seen before.
One of the photos depicts Wilson getting treatment at a medical tent along the path of the march. Wilson had intense blisters on her feet from walking over 10 miles each day.

The doctor who was tending to her injuries, June Finer, also flew in from New York to reunite with Wilson for the first time since Finer gently cared for Wilson’s bare feet six decades earlier.
“Are you the one who rubbed my feet?” Wilson asked, as the two women laughed and embraced. Finer, 90, said she wasn’t even aware that people were taking photos — she was laser-focused on the safety of the marchers.
Later, Wilson reflected on how meaningful the reunion had been.
“I longed to see her,” Wilson said.
Robert E. Wilson, Wilson’s eldest son, said he had never seen the photos of his mother that were on display in the old school building where she went to school. He was a young child when she completed the march.
“I’m so stunned. She always said she was in the march, but I never knew she was strong like that,” said the now 62-year-old who was raised in Marion.
Years of searching
Cheryl Gardner Davis has faint recollections of the evening in 1965 when her family hosted the weary walkers on the third night of the march to Montgomery. She remembers hordes of strangers erecting tents on her family’s farm in the rural Lowndes County, Alabama. Just 4 years old at the time, she remembers how her mother and older sister had to mop up mud inside their hallway from people who had come in to use their landline phone.
It wasn’t until she was an adult that she fully understood the significance of her family’s sacrifice: Her mom’s job as a teacher was threatened, the family’s power was cut off and a neighbor menaced them with his rifle. For years, she scoured the internet and libraries for photo evidence of their hardship — or at least a picture of her family’s property at the time.
Among the hundreds of photos that made their way back to Alabama in the first week of December, were pictures of the campsite at Davis’ childhood home. Davis, who had never seen the photos before, said it was a vital way to bring light to the people who often are an afterthought in the recounting of that transformative historical period.
“It’s, in a sense, validation. This actually happened, and people were there,” Davis said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28112230/AP25341796585296.jpg,,,2025-12-28 12:57:12.820127

All residents were safely evacuated, but their home burned to the ground.




Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in the state of Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




Dense stands of eastern red cedar trees near the building provided ample kindling for the blaze.
“The fire jumped the road and got into the cedars,” Yates Center Fire Chief Brandon Gaulding told KOAM News. “It went through the cedars so fast that by the time we got to the nursing home, we tried to do everything we could to save it, but the wind was too much.”
The highly flammable trees are everywhere in Kansas, including places they never used to grow.
Ecosystems across the state are undergoing a fundamental change. Prairie is being converted to forest as trees expand across the landscape, at the expense of grassland species. Woody encroachment, as this phenomenon is known, now converts more grassland in the Great Plains than row crop agriculture. Ranchers, conservationists and ecologists in Kansas have been documenting this shift for decades.
Kansas, however, is not alone.
“This is something that is happening in every grassy area on our planet right now,” said Jesse Nippert, a distinguished professor of biology at Kansas State University who studies woody encroachment. “Whether you’re talking about the steppes up in Alaska, whether you’re talking about sub-Alpine regions in Colorado, whether you’re talking about the Pampas and steppes in Argentina, this is literally happening in every grassland of our planet.”
“It is the single greatest conservation threat of what will be my lifetime,” Nippert added.
The causes are myriad, he said. While every region has unique factors, increased atmospheric carbon on a global scale plays an enormous role, researchers like Nippert have found. Trees, especially eastern red cedar, are thriving in arid regions of Kansas where they never before survived.
“As the CO2 continues to go up, the space that these plants can occupy also goes up, because now they can grow and survive on less water,” he said.

The repercussions extend beyond habitat loss to larger societal impacts, Nippert said.
Loss of rangeland for cattle is costing Kansas millions of dollars. Wildfires and tick-borne diseases are increasing, while available water has dramatically decreased. Woody species suck up more than twice as much water as grassland species, while their roots make the soils more porous, leading to further water loss. The changes are happening right down to the bedrock, Nippert said.
“It is a complete change in the fabric of the ecosystem,” he said.
Changes in land use are a major contributor to the increase in tree cover, but changes in land management also hold one of the keys to protecting what grassland remains, said Rob Manes, co-director of regenerative grazing lands strategy for the Nature Conservancy.
In Kansas, 15 million acres of grassland support cattle ranchers, the largest agricultural industry in the state. Regenerative grazing, a land management practice built on holistic practices such as prescribed fire and the rotation of cattle through pastures, encourages grassland resiliency and can keep species like eastern red cedar at bay.
“If we can establish a grazing regime that leaves enough residual grass to create a hot enough fire to kill cedar trees, then we increase forage for cattle, we increase drought resiliency, and we bring back lesser prairie chickens,” Manes said. “Economy and ecology, right there.”

Across Kansas, from the tallgrass prairie of the Flint Hills to the shortgrass prairie out west, cattle ranchers find themselves on the front lines of woody encroachment and habitat loss.
But many ranchers are fighting back.
“Ranchers tend to think ecologically,” said Chris Helzer, director of science and stewardship for the Nature Conservancy of Nebraska. “They’re out there living in the ranch, because they love the nature around them, and they love the complex system. And they think about how to make that complex system stay complex and work for them.”
Grasslands, it turns out, not only benefit from grazing, but they need it to survive, said Phillip Simmonds, regenerative livestock manager for the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska.

“That’s how the prairie systems evolved,” Simmonds said, “with a large grazing ruminant on it. So, if you don’t have them, you don’t have the prairies.”
For centuries, wild bison filled that role. Cattle, he said, are different but can achieve the same goals.
Justin Roemer, who manages both cattle and bison on the Smoky Valley Ranch near Colby,  said that when cattle are rotated and pastures aren’t overgrazed, they provide similar benefits to grasslands.
“If you’re managing for resiliency, in that conservation strategy or regenerative way, I don’t think you’re going to see a difference in the way that they graze,” he said. “I say that because I haven’t seen an impact between where our cattle graze and where our bison graze.”
Regenerative grazing practices can look a little different throughout the state, depending on where the ranch is located, but the fundamental principles are the same, Manes said.
“Regenerative grazing is nothing new,” he said. “It’s what nature has done with grazing lands.”
But, he said:  “There are ways to graze that don’t leave the land healthy. Regenerative grazing means the full scope of sustainable, which means that the ecosystem ends up healthy, the people who consume that animal protein that results from it end up healthy, and the economies of the communities that are involved in those enterprises are also healthy.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockefeller-Cedars-2-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-12-28 09:56:30.512723

A new law going into effect Jan. 1, 2026 prevents cities from penalizing outreach workers who provide services such as legal aid or hand out blankets at encampments.


Senate Bill 634 would have made a big splash if it survived in the form Pasadena Democrat Sasha Renée Pérez originally intended. She wanted to make it illegal for cities to cite or arrest homeless Californians for sleeping outside. But, faced with intense backlash from cities and law enforcement agencies, the legislator watered down her bill.
Now signed into law and taking effect Jan. 1, it takes aim at an issue that is much less prevalent on the streets of California. It says cities cannot punish outreach workers for helping homeless clients, even if those clients are sleeping in an illegal encampment. 
More precisely, the law says cities cannot bar people or organizations from providing homeless residents with legal services, medical care or things needed for survival, such as food, water, blankets, pillows and materials to protect themselves from the elements. 
“The legislation provides commonsense protections for service providers, especially non-profits and faith-based ones, who are doing the work every day to assist unhoused Californians,” Pérez said in an October statement.

San Bernardino County, on the other hand, said the law will “override local authority and restrict enforcement tools that cities and counties use to promote public safety.”
It’s not unheard of for aid workers to find themselves caught in the crosshairs of a city’s crackdown on homeless encampments. The Bay Area city of Fremont earlier this year briefly made “aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal homeless encampment a misdemeanor. Its city council later walked back that language — after CalMatters first reported it — but it made a lasting impression on state legislators. 
The legislation follows a statewide push toward the increased policing of homeless Californians. In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court gave cities more power to cite and arrest people for sleeping outside, even if they have no shelter available. Since then, arrests and citations for homelessness-related offenses have soared in cities across the state.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070523-Street-Medicine-Project-LV-CM_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-28 08:56:43.540733

Fewer inspections, weaker enforcement and less oversight: Deep cuts to state budgets and at the Environmental Protection Agency are preventing regulators from fully protecting the public from pollution, according to a report released earlier this month by the Environmental Integrity Project.
The financial crisis at these agencies is occurring amid the expansion of the fossil fuel, plastics and petrochemical industries, said EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan.
When states have fewer resources, Duggan said, “those protections, those rights that every American has under our environmental laws, are not being realized.”

President Trump’s budget proposal would decimate 2026 spending at the EPA by 55 percent, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans are recommending cutting it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a reduction of just 5 percent.
If enacted, these reductions would exacerbate the EPA’s financial plight. Over the last 15 years, the agency’s budget has been slashed by 40 percent, Duggan said, and its workforce by 18 percent. Since Trump began his second term, more than 3,000 EPA workers have retired or have been terminated as part of the administration’s gutting of the agency.
The upshot of these cuts is that states have to pick up the slack, which is central to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s vision for the agency. In March, on the day he announced “the biggest deregulatory action in history,” Zeldin said he intended to “give power back to the states.”
However, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating most EPA grants to the states, undercutting their agencies’ ability to wield that power.
Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says. The agency has also struggled to retain employees; 30 percent of its workforce has less than two years of experience, and half have less than five years.
Kathryn Guerra worked for nearly four years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where she helped small businesses and local governments comply with regulations. Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.
She’s now the TCEQ campaign director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The funding cuts to TCEQ described in the report “render the agency largely ineffective,” Guerra said, “and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness.”
According to TCEQ’s biennial report to the Texas legislature, it takes an average of 351 days to process one enforcement case. The agency’s most recent enforcement report shows a backlog of 1,400 enforcement cases, Guerra said.
“Ultimately it means communities don’t get relief from the environmental harms those polluters are causing,” she said.
States with the deepest budget cuts to environmental agencies from 2010–2024, according to the report, are:

Mississippi—71 percent
South Dakota—61 percent
Alabama—49 percent
Texas—33 percent
Montana—32 percent

North Carolina is among the states whose budgets have contracted in the past 15 years. While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.
“These cuts have real impacts on the people of our state,” said Drew Ball, director of Southeast Campaigns for the Natural Resources Defense Council, on a press call about the report.
Ball also serves as a Buncombe County Commissioner in an area wrecked by Hurricane Helene in 2024.
“When a family in eastern North Carolina notices their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain, there are fewer staff who can investigate,” he went on. “There are fewer inspectors available to respond when hurricanes send flood waters through low lying areas, mixing industrial pollution, animal waste and storm water, the staff responsible for tracking and responding to those threats are being asked to do far more with far less.”
During the 2008 recession, North Carolina lawmakers cut DEQ’s budget, part of a statewide belt-tightening. However, the Republican-led legislature has not fully restored those reductions in more economically robust times and during an era of increased population growth.
From 2020 to 2024, census data show the state’s population has grown by more than 5 percent. But over the same period, when accounting for inflation, DEQ’s budget decreased.
In 2019, the DEQ budget was $97.4 million, according to state documents, equivalent to $123.7 million today.
The 2023 DEQ budget totalled $108.7 million, or $115.8 million in today’s money. That’s a 6 percent decrease compared with four years earlier.
Some of the agency’s functions rely on permitting fees. In at least one instance, a healthier environment has resulted in unexpected financial consequences. As state and federal regulations have made the air cleaner, Title V facilities, the largest air pollution sources, have decreased their emissions, according to a 2023 DEQ report to the legislature.
This has translated to a drop in “billable tons”—54 percent over a decade—that generate a portion of the agency’s revenue. Yet the state’s 300 Title V facilities still must be inspected and their permits renewed, even as the number of staff has decreased by 19 percent.
In 2024, the legislature increased the permit fee to help close the gap.
North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.
States with the next largest staffing cuts, 2010-2024, are:

Connecticut—26 percent
Arizona—25 percent
Louisiana—24 percent
Missouri and Kansas—20 percent

Adding to the budgetary crisis, it’s also been difficult for North Carolina DEQ to retain or hire employees. At its peak three years ago, the agency had vacancy rates that exceeded 20 percent. DEQ officials said at the time that agency wages, whose boundaries are set by the legislature, can’t compete with the private sector.
“Many families today live with waste in roadside ditches, wells that are too contaminated to drink from and constant fear about what the next storm will carry into their yards,” Ball said. “Yet the very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden, with shrinking staff, shrinking budgets and shrinking political support, and now the federal government is proposing the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years. That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unlined-coal-ash-pond-Jefferson-County-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-12-28 08:12:08.223629

If full-time work doesn’t pay enough to live here while others keep raising rents for profit, this isn’t an economy — it’s exploitation.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jess Frey: Vermont’s economy no longer works for working families.","Dear Editor,
I’m done being told to “work harder” in a state where the numbers prove the system is failing — especially for kids.



I have a healthy 3-year-old, and like countless Vermont parents, I am doing everything right. I work. I budget. I plan. And still, stability feels out of reach. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a single adult in Vermont needs about $25 an hour just to cover basic necessities — housing, food, transportation, health care — and nearly $50 an hour for a single parent with ONE child. That’s survival, not comfort.
The Vermont Department of Labor tracks hundreds of occupations. Only a small fraction pay anywhere near a living wage. Most working Vermonters are funneled into jobs that cannot support basic life here, no matter how hard they work. This isn’t just a wage problem. It’s an availability problem, a pay problem, a housing problem — a system problem.
Near Burlington, simply covering rent, groceries, and utilities often requires close to $90,000 a year. More than half of Vermont renters are cost-burdened, spending over 30% of their income on housing. One car repair, one medical bill, one child care emergency can tip a family into crisis.
People love to judge. “Get a better job.” “Budget better.” “Stop making excuses.” But when full-time work still doesn’t pay enough to live here, that isn’t personal failure. That is systemic failure.
This isn’t abstract. It’s parents crying in their cars. It’s kids growing up under constant stress. If full-time work doesn’t pay enough to live here while others keep raising rents for profit, this isn’t an economy — it’s exploitation. Vermont doesn’t have a work ethic problem. It has a greed problem. Until we choose people over profit, nothing changes.

As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.
California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals, and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles, and other health-related expenses.
Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.
The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.
Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.
“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”
The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality, and equity.
California’s affordability office last year set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5% in 2025 and declining to 3% by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers, and other payers.
Earlier this year, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8% in 2026 and declining to 1.6% by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.
The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.
Hospitals’ Pushback
California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.
“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”
In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.
Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decade and is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”
To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.
But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.
In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.
He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.
Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”
The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.
Reduced Competition
Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.
Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.
“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.
California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.
“There’s a lot of talk about using HR 1 and other federal policies as an excuse to raise prices on commercial payers,” Ian Lewis, an affordability office board member and policy director for UNITE HERE Local 2, a hospitality workers union in the Bay Area, said at the agency’s July board meeting, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s no more blood to be squeezed from this stone.”

(Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management via Flickr)Trump administration land-management changes in eight Western states, including South Dakota, are worrying some conservationists concerned about the declining greater sage grouse population.
The Bureau of Land Management announced on Dec. 22 its decision to modify greater sage grouse land-use plans on about 65 million acres. The plan affects areas in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, California, Utah and Wyoming.
The bureau said its actions support Trump administration orders “unleashing American energy” and advancing “national energy independence.” Acting Bureau of Land Management Director Bill Groffy said in a news release that the agency is “strengthening American energy security while ensuring the sage-grouse continues to thrive.” 
Greater sage grouse are are known for their chunky bodies and mating dance. The bird has been eligible for Endangered Species Act protections since the early 2010s, according to the Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity. Instead of listing sage grouse as endangered, the federal government adopted revised land management plans in 2015 establishing limits on mining, transmission lines and other heavy industry operations within priority sage grouse habitat areas.

Greater sage grouse have been in decline nationally, with populations reduced from millions to fewer than 800,000, according to the bureau. The decline in South Dakota has been caused by a loss of sagebrush, livestock overgrazing, fire, invasive plant species, oil and gas development, and increased mortality due to West Nile virus, according to the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks’ Greater Sage Grouse Action Plan for 2022 to 2026.
“More frequent drought associated with climate change could also be a threat,” the state plan says. “Overhunting was also a historic factor in the population decline.”
South Dakota’s action plan says the birds once spread across the western third of the state outside of the Black Hills. The birds now primarily inhabit only portions of Butte and Harding counties. 
Activists push back
The Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release that the new federal plan removes protections from millions of acres of prime sage grouse habitat.
“Trump’s reckless actions will speed the extinction of greater sage grouse by allowing unfettered fossil fuel extraction and other destructive development across tens of millions of acres of public lands,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director for the center, in the release. Spivak also said the center will “see Trump in court.”
Spivak said earlier federal plans required the bureau to prioritize areas outside designated sage grouse nesting habitats — called leks — for oil and gas development, but that requirement is gone in the new plan. She said the change could make it harder for groups like hers to challenge leasing and development decisions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Spivak also said the new plan removes an annual analysis meant to flag population declines. She said the system was designed to detect localized declines early enough for managers to “ring the alarm bell” and adjust actions before losses become irreversible. 
Spivak said the changes matter in South Dakota because the state’s sage grouse are “no longer self-sustaining” and survive partly through movement and habitat connectivity with populations in Montana and Wyoming.
“The birds don’t stop at borders,” Spivak said in an interview. She described the newly finalized plans as a shift from a federal standard toward state-by-state approaches, arguing that inconsistent management is risky for an interstate species.
The bureau’s news release says its new plans were developed “in close partnership with Western governors and state wildlife managers” and reflect “better alignment on adaptive management and other conservation strategies.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-28 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Are legislators keeping their promise to follow the Mississippi Constitution?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/28/legislators-mississippi-constitution/,"Before legislators vote on public funds going to private schools, maybe they should follow their oath and read the Mississippi Constitution.","In the 1990s and early 2000s, then-state Rep. John Reeves, a Jackson Republican, made the point of order on more than one occasion that economic development projects offering incentives to private corporations should require a two-thirds majority to win the approval of the Mississippi Legislature.
Reeves danced to his own tune and would often forgo the edicts of both political parties. He argued that it should require a two-thirds vote to provide the benefits to the private companies because of Article 66 of the Mississippi Constitution.
Article 66 states, “No law granting a donation or gratuity in favor of any person or object shall be enacted except by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members elect of each branch of the Legislature, nor by any vote for a sectarian purpose or use.”
Then-House Speaker Tim Ford, a Baldwyn Democrat, ruled against Reeves’ point of order, stating that the economic development package was for the greater good, not just to benefit a private company.
In later years, Rep.Bryant Clark, a Holmes County Democrat, raised a point of order saying that some of the funding in the annual end-of-the-session mammoth bill that doles out money for projects across the state was going to private entities, which thus would require a two-thirds vote. Clark later withdrew his point of order when it was pointed out that some of the money was going to private entities that he would support, such as Tougaloo College.
Money going to private Tougaloo College brings up the issue-du-jour – public funds being awarded to private schools under the moniker of school choice.
Republican House Speaker Jason White has proclaimed that school choice will be a priority during the session that begins in early January.
As the issue of vouchers for students to attend private schools is debated in the upcoming session, the question is whether there is in the current Mississippi Legislature a John Reeves-type who would argue that the voucher – whether to a school or to a student to attend a private school – is a gift, thus requiring a two-thirds majority vote to pass.
There is, as has been reported often, another section of the Mississippi Constitution – Section 208 – that states plainly that any public funds cannot go to any school that is “not a free school.”
On occasion, when points of order are raised, the presiding officer will respond that it is not up to the Legislature to decide constitutional issues. That is the job of the courts, they have said in the past.
But in reality, that argument is disingenuous, even hogwash.
After all, in their oath of office, legislators swear to “carefully read (or have read to me) the constitution of this state, and will endeavor to note, and as a legislator to execute, all the requirements thereof imposed on the Legislature.”
Each time, legislators call up a bill for a vote they do such in accordance with the mandates of the Mississippi Constitution. They allow legislators to enter a motion to reconsider after a final vote on a bill because that is what the Mississippi Constitution mandates just as they require a three-fifths vote to pass a revenue or tax bill because it is a constitutional requirement.
The list of areas where legislators adhere to constitutional mandates is long, and at times nonsensical and antiquated, but they do so because that is what the Mississippi Constitution says to do. Any legislator can request a bill to be read aloud to the chamber because it is constitutionally required.
In a sense, they seem to be cherry picking which constitutional mandates to follow.
Perhaps, they should at least consider and provide a reason for not adhering to the mandates preventing public funds from going to schools that are not free and requiring a two-thirds vote to provide a gift to a private entity.
After all, it is in the Mississippi Constitution.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06201256/Flag10.jpg,,,2025-12-28 07:12:15.559536

Jillian Kilborn is particularly excited to put up her bird feeders this year. Food shortages up north are expected to send winter finches to Vermont for the season, meaning that she could see Red Crossbills and Pine Grosbeaks in her yard for the first time since 2021. 
Birders call it the “finch irruption.” 
“We were home on a consistent basis because of Covid, so I really kind of got to engage with the birds that were coming that winter,” she said. “And it was really cool, because we had big flocks of all those species. So I’m just hopeful that we’re going to see the same thing this winter.”
Kilborn isn’t just an avid birder; she’s a bird biologist for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, meaning that she has a fascination with studying how birds interact with their environment. 
“There’s so many different species that use so many different types of habitats that it’s just every day I’m learning something new,” she said. 
While birds don’t need backyard feeders to survive, Kilborn said, the activity is a great way to interact with nature from the comfort of your own home.
But the department also has an unofficial motto: “feed birds, not bears,” Jaclyn Comeau, the black bear project leader for the department, said via email. Cold temperatures and snowy days are the only time when Vermonters can feel safe putting up bird feeders without the fear of unwanted bear visitors, Joshua Morse, spokesperson for the Department of Fish and Wildlife, said in an email. 
If you’re thinking of putting up a bird feeder this year, here are some tips about how to do it safely and what else to know about getting into backyard birding.

When is it safe to start putting out food for birds?
Bears find the most common types of bird food very tasty, according to the department’s website. They’re particularly fond of suet and black oil sunflower seeds and will sniff out even the remnants of seed left on the ground around a feeder. 
Department officials have previously said that the number of human-bear interactions has been on the rise for the past decade, leading to bears being killed. 
So the department recommends that Vermonters limit their bird feeding to the season when bears are in hibernation, which generally runs from the beginning of December to the end of March. Morse wrote that the recent cold snap has made it the perfect time to start feeding. 
“We still recommend people keep an eye on local conditions though,” he said. “If you’re in a place where there’s still not snow on the ground and the temps are spiking above freezing on the regular, best to hold off.”
Comeau wrote that you should also keep an eye on whether your neighbors have had any bear visits. If you hear of any bear activity, the department asks that you take your feeders down and wait until at least a week has passed without any new signs or sightings. 
“Lack of food is a major factor that drives bears into their winter dens and artificial food sources like birdfeeders can incentivize bears to remain active,” she said. 
What about the risk of bird flu?
In 2022, the department asked Vermonters to hold off on feeding birds at all because of the risk of bird flu, which can spread through bird feeders that become hotspots of bird activity. 
Wild birds are less susceptible to bird flu than domesticated poultry, but they can become vectors that spread the disease to local poultry farms, Kilborn said via email. 
But Morse said that bird flu, while still circulating in Vermont, is not as bad as it was in previous years, and the department isn’t issuing guidance for bird flu at this time. 
He noted that it’s still important to clean feeders regularly to prevent disease transmission. The department’s website recommends cleaning your feeder about once a month with diluted bleach or dish detergent and hot water, then rinsing them and drying them off thoroughly before putting them back outside. 
Kilborn said via email that Vermonters should keep an eye out for dead birds that can be a sign of bird flu in the community. If you find multiple dead birds at a feeder, you should take the feeders down for at least two weeks and clean them before you put them back up, along with reporting it to the department.

What birds can I expect in my backyard this year?
The Finch Research Network has a full breakdown on its website of the winter finch species coming to the area. But that’s just the beginning of the many birds that inhabit Vermont backyards. 
More than 200 bird species have been documented in Vermont, according to the department, but not all of them have a tendency to wander close to humans. The department has downloadable checklists of birds to get you started with the most common species. 
Kilborn recommended the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s bird identification app, Merlin Bird ID, to help figure out what birds you’re seeing in your yard or in the wild. In fact, the department uses the app’s data from its “Feeder Watch” to analyze the patterns of different species in Vermont. 
The Audubon Society chapter in Vermont also has many resources on backyard birding in the state, including opportunities to contribute to conservation and research. It hosts an annual Christmas Bird Count to help track the distribution of wild birds in their wintertime habitats. 
What else can I do to foster a bird-friendly backyard?
Kilborn said there’s been a growing national movement to foster more wildlife-friendly environments in backyards. For most people, that means planting more native plants, maintaining ecological diversity, and participating in “No Mow May,” a monthlong pause in mowing to give insects a home. 
Seed-bearing and fruit-bearing native plants are great for local bird populations, she said. She also recommended lowering pesticide use to prevent killing the insects that birds feed on. 
Even small changes can be helpful. In her own backyard, Kilborn tries to mow around flowers when they’re in bloom and only mows them after they’ve faded. 
“I personally think it’s more interesting to look at pretty flowers and different things going on, and it draws all sorts of different things to the yard that are using it,” she said. 
Along with her platform feeder, Kilborn maintains chickadee boxes, a house wren box and a kestrel box that she’s put up for nesting birds. The department has resources on nesting boxes, native plants and more tips for a wildlife-friendly backyard on its website. 
“I just feel really fortunate to be able to get a glimpse and learn about (birds) on a day to day basis and try and make it better,” Kilborn said. “That’s kind of what keeps me going.”

The ice cream plant in Waterbury topped the list released this month by the state with 130 violations, due to a failure to submit a number of sampling reports.

This story by Lisa Scagliotti was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout on Dec. 22, 2025.
A state announcement of industrial wastewater pretreatment permit violations reports that Ben & Jerry’s ice cream plant in Waterbury topped the list of 17 companies that logged infractions in 2024. 
The Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation oversees the industrial pretreatment program in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Federal rules require the state to publicly report significant non-compliance each year. 
The data review and report for 2024, released on Dec. 12 by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, lists 17 permittees found to be “in significant non-compliance during the 2024 reporting year.”
Department Commissioner Misty Sinsigalli said the state views the industrial facilities that hold such permits “as key partners in environmental stewardship,” guided by specific requirements they must follow. 
“Fulfilling these permit requirements is how we work together to safeguard the health of Vermont’s lakes, rivers, and wetlands,” Sinsigalli said.
Industrial facilities such as breweries, dairy processing plants, and metal finishers receive pretreatment permits to discharge wastewater to municipal wastewater treatment facilities. The permits set discharge limits to prevent overloading the local wastewater treatment infrastructure. 
Garrett Walsh, pretreatment coordinator with the state’s Wastewater Management Program, explained that the permitting process aims to track industrial wastewater, which ultimately is discharged into Vermont’s rivers and lakes. Big industrial entities that generate large quantities of wastewater are required to have systems on site to pretreat their wastewater before it’s sent into the municipal systems in the communities where they are located. 
“Proper pretreatment helps ensure safe discharges from wastewater treatment facilities into our waterways,” Walsh said. “Without timely and accurate reports, DEC cannot properly manage its pretreatment program.”
As part of the permit requirements, the permittees must submit monthly reports, report instances of non-compliance, and not exceed limits for pollutants set in their permits. Some examples of pollutants are nutrients, heavy metals, and biochemical oxygen demand (a measure of how waste impacts a water body’s oxygen content).
State officials explained that significant non-compliance can occur when facilities discharge a pollutant that causes imminent risk to human health, or discharge pollutants that exceed their permit limits. Other examples of permit violations cover instances when permit-holders fail to submit monthly reports and other required documentation on time.
Violations involve reporting, not overflows
The list released this month by the state shows that six companies in 2024 exceeded the wastewater discharge limits and/or did not meet their requirements for monitoring set in their permits. Ben & Jerry’s Waterbury ice cream plant topped that list with 130 violations. 
In Ben & Jerry’s case, the permit violations did not pertain to its Waterbury plant exceeding its wastewater output limits. 
“It was due to a personnel issue,” said Heather Collins, the state’s Wastewater Management Program Manager. “It was not a flow issue.”
Ben & Jerry’s spokesman Sean Greenwood confirmed that the company failed to meet some of its reporting requirements last year. 
“In 2024, a routine internal audit of our wastewater treatment facility revealed that several required reports had not been submitted to the state. We notified state officials and began a thorough review of our practices,” Greenwood said. “It is important to note that at no time did Ben & Jerry’s release wastewater amounts exceeding permitted limits.”
Ben & Jerry’s staff failed to submit a number of sampling reports in 2024. Collins said the 130 violations were for 24 missed reports on suspended solids, 12 on biochemical oxygen demand, two on total phosphorous and 92 daily reports on pH levels. The other seven violations for Ben & Jerry’s cited in the state’s announcement pertained to monthly reports not filed on time.
Each wastewater pretreatment permit has specific requirements around reporting information to regulators, Collins explained. 
“It’s easy to rack up that many violations if you have a daily requirement to collect and analyze some type of sample,” she said. 
Each report has a required deadline, after which state regulators review the reports. 
“If it’s 30 days past that date, if we haven’t received a report then you’re reporting late,” she said. 
Once Ben & Jerry’s managers were aware of the reporting lapses, they turned their attention to improving their process for reporting, including hiring a consultant for advice, Greenwood said. 
“We strengthened our operations, appointing a highly experienced Chief Wastewater Operator to best manage our operations moving forward, and engaged an independent environmental auditing firm to review our facilities and procedures,” he said. 
Regulators from both the state of Vermont and the federal EPA visited the Waterbury ice cream plant. Following those reviews, the company implemented all recommendations from the auditing firm, which included updating procedural safeguards, hiring the additional wastewater operator, and establishing a system of checks and balances for monthly report sign‑offs, Greenwood noted.  
Although all of the violations Ben & Jerry’s was cited for pertain to reporting and not exceeding the plant’s wastewater limits, Collins said it’s important for the state to have timely reports.
“When we don’t receive reports, and if they miss samples, I can’t say that they were within permits limits or not, because I have no sample to determine that,” Collins explained. “If you don’t collect samples, I can’t tell if they exceeded the limits.”
P. Howard “Skip” Flanders chairs the Board of Commissioners that oversees Waterbury’s Edward Farrar Utility District, which operates the municipal water and wastewater departments. He said issues with wastewater from the Ben & Jerry’s plant in the 1980s led to the company adding its pretreatment system around 1990 which has since worked well to prevent the industrial volumes from overburdening the municipal system. Flanders said there were no instances in 2024 or this year where the plant exceeded its wastewater output limits that resulted in EFUD exceeding its discharge limits.
The flow coming from the ice cream maker typically does not strain the EFUD system, Flanders said.  
“The Ben and Jerry’s volume is pretty well diluted when mixed and run through our lagoon system and then through the phosphorus removal process,” he explained. 
The rest of the list
The other six companies on the 2024 violations list for having exceeded their permit limits and/or not met their monitoring requirements and were found in significant non-compliance are: Metal stamping company New England Precision in Randolph with 68 violations; St. Albans Creamery in St. Albans, 23 violations; Butternut Mountain Farm maple sugar company in Morrisville, 16 violations; dairy cooperative Agri-Mark, Inc. in Middlebury, 14 violations; and Commonwealth Dairy in Brattleboro, nine violations, according to the state announcement. 
The state’s report also lists a total of 11 companies that did not submit monthly reports or other required documents on time, which constitutes significant non-compliance with their permit requirements. 
In this category, Ben & Jerry’s in Waterbury and Swan Valley Cheese of Vermont in Swanton each had seven violations. Ben & Jerry’s failed to submit seven monthly reports on time. Swan Valley missed making four monthly reports on time and had three other instances of failing to submit other documents, the list notes. Two other companies with reporting infractions in the same category included Lost Nation Brewery and Rock Art Brewery, both in Morrisville, with five and two reports not submitted on time, respectively. 
A third category in the state announcement notes that two companies — Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe and Zero Gravity Craft Brewery in South Burlington — had significant violations for not following operation and maintenance requirements and not notifying state regulators. Trapp Family Lodge had one such infraction; Zero Gravity had seven, the list notes. 
State officials noted that the information in this public report is based on 2024 data, and it does not represent the current compliance status of the companies on the list. 
Collins said it takes time to review the various reports submitted by companies and her office right now is going through reports from the third quarter of this year. She said there have been no violations at the Waterbury ice cream plant to date. 
Greenwood at Ben & Jerry’s confirmed: “We’re happy to share that we have had no non‑compliance issues in 2025.”

Co-owners Andrea Jones and Sandy Scott carry forward a 36-year legacy of community, resilience and friendship.

Alana Dutcher-Hirsch is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
HARDWICK — Best friends and store owners for 11 years, Andrea Jones and Sandy Scott — “work wives,” as they affectionately call each other  — run Hardwick’s Galaxy Bookshop with pride. On a snowy Thursday afternoon, the two women bustled around the store, taking business calls, ringing out customers and fulfilling book orders.
“Thursdays are my favorite day of the week because we’re both here and we have fun,” Jones said. Her gaze shifted to Scott who had just rejoined the conversation after a sale at the counter. 
Together, Jones and Scott now anchor one of Hardwick’s most enduring small businesses. Their partnership — forged quickly, and almost by chance — has carried the Galaxy Bookshop through ownership changes, community crises and the daily work of keeping an independent bookstore alive in a rural town.
Though the Galaxy Bookshop is now co-owned by Jones and Scott, the story begins long before they arrived. The store was founded in 1988 by Linda Ramsdell, a recent graduate of Brown University. With little more than the sense that Hardwick needed a bookstore, she developed the concept behind Galaxy. 
“I thought I’d give bookselling a try for five years,” Ramsdell said. 
Those five years stretched into several decades in which Ramsdell shaped the Galaxy Bookshop into the community fixture it is today. Scott, who is from Hardwick, worked at the bookstore on her summers off from school. In 2003, after graduating from Champlain College, Scott came back to work as the bookstore’s event coordinator and bookseller. 
After more than 25 years of owning the store, Ramsdell was ready to move on in 2014, and offered the store to Scott. But the recent college graduate couldn’t afford to purchase the store on her own. 
Enter Jones, an avid customer. Originally from Maine, she came to Vermont for college and worked as an English teacher at Hazen Union School after graduating. While shopping at the store she heard about the switch in management and Scott’s interest in purchasing the store. 
“I went home and I said to my family, as a joke, ‘I’m gonna buy a Galaxy bookshop,’ and they went: ‘Oh my God, you should totally do that,’” Jones said. 
Within just a few months, Jones and Scott agreed to purchase Galaxy Bookstore together. 
“We went from barely knowing each other to being business partners in three months,” Scott said. 
Ramsdell, meanwhile, was thrilled with the new partnership.
“The feeling of selling the store to Scott and Jones felt like keeping it in the family,” she said.
Although the women come from very different backgrounds — Scott has experience in bookkeeping, while Jones built her career in teaching — they each bring something essential to the Galaxy Bookshop.

“I had nothing to bring to the table other than loving to read. Sandy’s all the institutional knowledge and the practical day to day stuff,” Jones said. 
As an avid reader, nothing makes Scott happier than helping someone find a book. 
“When they’re excited about a book and I’m excited about it … the conversations that we have here are really wonderful,” Scott said.
The two friends only work one day a week together, though: Thursdays. That’s when everything comes together, they said, and when they can lean on each other for support. 
But the bookshop has faced significant challenges in recent years. In 2022, a fire in an apartment above the store triggered the building’s sprinkler system, causing the store to flood. Scott and Jones launched a $20,000 GoFundMe campaign to help with recovery expenses from significant water damage to the store and its inventory. For six months, the Galaxy operated out of customers’ living rooms and borrowed spaces around town — staying open in whatever way it could.
Hardwick’s recent floods also took a toll on the business. During the major flooding events of 2023 and 2024, access to the downtown was limited for weeks, and sales dropped as residents focused on recovery. 
“We’ve gotten through COVID, and we’ve gotten through a flood,” said Jones. “People always step up and show us how much they love this store and how much they want it to be here,” she said. 
Above the front register, a large-scale painting captures the store’s relationship with its community. In it, familiar Hardwick faces move books through town, framed by swirling stars and loose, whimsical brushstrokes that give the shop its enchanted feel.
“Sandy and Andrea are creative and stay involved in the community of professional booksellers,” Ramsdell said. “They’re innovative and involved with Hardwick, and they’re both great readers.” 
Even with all of the hardships, the store has always bounced back. Jones said she knows they won’t run the Galaxy forever, and when the time comes, she and Scott will choose its next stewards carefully. “The Galaxy is bigger than us,” she said. 
Scott’s love for the shop is rooted in a lifelong dream she’s had to own a bookstore. “Andrea and I sometimes talk about how we’re kind of stewards of the bookstore; this bookstore exists in town because of all of the support of the community and we’re stewarding it until it ends up being handed off to the next people who will take it on,” Scott said. 
A bookstore, or a library, is an essential part of a town, Jones said. “I wanted to make sure that there was a bookstore in my community,” said Jones. “Because, you know, I used to come here all the time. I still do. More. But now I own it.”

We hired two community engagement reporters — one in Bridgeport and one in Hartford — who joined the staff mid-year and immediately went to work getting to know their communities.
Reginald David, who covers Bridgeport, and Mariana Navarrete Villegas, our reporter in Hartford, joined CT Mirror as part of the Raising Voices Lab, an initiative focused on local reporting and service journalism that aims to understand and meet the information needs of historically underserved communities.
Right away, they began engaging with people across their cities, meetings with neighborhood groups known as NRZs, advocates with the NAACP and Make the Road, university officials and many more local leaders and organizations. They also hosted their own listening sessions, bringing the conversation directly to the people in their communities and learning what people care about and what policies affect them.
As part of the initiative, CT Mirror also launched text lines (sign up for Bridgeport’s here and Hartford’s here!) to provide people with a direct channel for news updates about each city and to open a new line of two-way communication with residents.
The reporters used social media and in-person activities to reach people who may not access traditional media sources for their news or information.
In October, Navarrete Villegas talked to people at a Day of the Dead event in Hartford, interviewing them live about what the day meant to them and working with photojournalist Shahrzad Rasekh to create instant portraits they could take home.
Earlier this month, David interviewed Bridgeport Police Chief Roderick Porter in a Facebook Live event that informed viewers about the police official’s views on public safety and community trust.
They both wrote stories and explained issues important to their communities that we published on our website as well. From education and voting in Bridgeport to housing and cultural history in Hartford, David and Navarrete Villegas were there to capture it. 
Here’s a recap of their efforts to engage with two of the state’s largest cities in 2025.
Social impact
Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum



Among the CT Mirror social media posts with the most engagement this year was Navarrete Villegas’ story about a new museum dedicated to Black equestrian history in Hartford. Our Instagram audience clicked the ‘like’ button more than 16,000 times on a slideshow of images and quotes from the story, which was well-read and widely shared.
The Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum, the brainchild of Ebony Horsewomen, Inc., commemorates the first African American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service, as well as the history of the Black equestrian horsewomen and men across the country. It serves as a cultural landmark and archival center in the city’s North End.

Harding High School



Our reporters’ social videos also engaged readers. A video created out of a Harding High School pep rally in Bridgeport and posted to David’s own social media account drew more than 300 ‘likes’ on Instagram. The video was related to a story David wrote about the high school’s improvement in state rankings, which officially removed it from the state’s list of ‘turnaround’ schools. The move meant the school had met specific improvement goals and is no longer considered one of the state’s lowest-performing.
Now considered a focus school, Harding still receives targeted state support to help students with higher needs continue improving, placing it a step above turnaround status and on a path toward sustained achievement.
Explainers
The reporters also wrote explanatory pieces, based on questions they were hearing residents asking in the communities they cover. Here are some of their more recent so-called explainers.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)Ken Hush gave Emporia State University the best Christmas present possible in 2025.
He quit.
The former Koch executive and higher education outsider spent roughly four years as ESU’s president, claiming he was reshaping the institution’s future. What he actually did was create chaos. His successor, a veteran administrator named Matthew Baker, will now have to figure out how to rebuild a city and college fractured by ignorance.
Hush’s place on the naughty list was secure years ago.
He oversaw the firing of 30 tenured and tenure-track faculty without warning. Legal action continues. He sent secret bonuses to dozens of professors without explanation. He closed programs and departments. When enrollment cratered, he lobbied the Kansas Legislature ceaselessly for special, ESU-only payments (and received $18 million to balance the books). All the while, he refused to voice a scintilla of doubt about his path of destruction.
With his exit fast approaching, Hush embarked on a news media tour of sorts, talking about his tenure with the Lawrence Journal-World and pledging to donate the equivalent of his salary for the past four years to the university. That’s a cool $1.4 million, in case you wondered.
Generous? Perhaps. To me, it proves that Hush torched people’s lives and careers for the fun of it. He did it for free.
Who knows when or if ESU can fully recover. I doubt that highly qualified professors will want to take a risk on a university that has treated their peers so shabbily.
The American Association of University Professors’ 2023 report on the mess put it this way: “Remarkably, the Kansas Board of Regents and the ESU administration have insisted that they support tenure and academic freedom. If we take them at their word, we must conclude that they are unfit to lead, least of all during a crisis.”
We already know that students fled in the aftermath, likely leading to increases at other Kansas institutions. Hush and his cronies have hailed a recent increase in enrollment, but even a dead cat will bounce off the pavement when dropped from a great height. ESU’s enrollment is still down more than 17% over the past five years.
We should note here that Hush and his administration treated both student and professional journalists with contempt. They stonewalled open record requests, lied about our persistent and accurate coverage in public letters, and repeatedly refused to answer our questions.
They may have felt confident in their ability to steer the narrative to their own purposes. But all they did was wound a campus and town that needed care and attention rather than high-handed hackery.
I know that good people in Emporia hate when I write columns like this. They’re trying, they’ve told me. They want to build something great and strengthen their town. Those of us at Kansas Reflector have deep-seated connections to the university and empathize. Our editor in chief Sherman Smith graduated from ESU’s (now-defunct) journalism program. Sunday columnist Max McCoy ran that very program.
My parents received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the school. If they hadn’t met in Emporia, I quite literally wouldn’t exist.
We get it. We really do. But Emporia and ESU were never going to turn a corner with Hush in charge of the university. The fact that the Kansas Board of Regents picked a thoroughly experienced university administrator to succeed him tells us all we need to know.
Baker is a “proven leader with extensive experience developing and implementing initiatives designed to help students succeed in college and after graduation,” said Board of Regents chairman Blake Benson.
It would have been nice to have had one of those earlier, huh?
The “ESU model” has ended, in much the same way that former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax-cutting “experiment” did. An ideologically driven chief executive wrecked something beautiful and precious. Now its up to the rest of us to clear the rubble and build anew.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-27 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi blueberry farmers look to future generations to join industry,"Kristen Kaylor, Roy Howard Community Journalism Center and Nischit Sharma, Roy Howard Community Journalism Center",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/27/blueberry-farmers-look-to-future-generations/,"J&D Blueberry Farm has evolved into a year-round business that turns Mississippi-grown blueberries into teas, juices and baked goods.","POPLARVILLE — As Mississippi’s blueberry industry faces a steep decline, one Poplarville farm is finding new ways to keep the state fruit growing — from fresh berries to teas, baked goods and even dog treats. 
J&D Blueberry Farm, co-founded by Donald Van de Werken and Jeff Brown, started small in 2004 selling fresh blueberries. Over time, they expanded their operation to include blueberry-infused products and a mobile bakery, part of an effort to build a lasting brand and reduce food waste. Van de Werken said their goal is to preserve the local blueberry market while creating new opportunities for future generations of farmers. 
Evolution of the farm

Van de Werken, who has an agricultural background in citrus farming, said growing blueberries in south Mississippi felt like a natural fit. Poplarville, known for its annual Blueberry Jubilee, has long been a hub for growers across the region. 
 “We’re trying to build a brand more than we’re trying to sell,” Van de Werken said. “It makes great sense to sell, to make money because that’s what keeps you in business, but if you build a brand, people tend to recognize you.” 
That mindset has guided J&D Blueberry Farm’s growth. What began as a micro fresh-produce operation has evolved into a year-round business that turns Mississippi-grown blueberries into teas, juices and baked goods. Van de Werken said the idea was to create products with longer shelf life and a stronger local identity. 
Beyond the blueberry bushes

At J&D Blueberry Farms, even imperfect berries have a purpose. Van de Werken said the team uses pulp and juice from fruit that might otherwise go to waste to make new products. 
“For example, we take the fresh blueberries and then we pulp it to make juice, where otherwise, if the berry wasn’t perfect, we would have just tossed it,” he said. “It would have been complete food waste.”  
That approach led the farm to partner with the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce to research and refine its products. Today, J&D Blueberry Farm is known for its blueberry-infused teas but also sells coffee, baking mixes, juices and blueberry-based dog treats.
Van de Werken said their product line expanded even further in 2013 after acquiring a bakery from retired baker Capt. Karl Mueller, who was a neighbor and friend of van de Werken’s.  
“We became self-taught bakers, and we’re known for our German stollen, which is a Christmas bread, and also blueberry pies, muffins, pound cakes — and we now dabble in gluten-free products,” he said. 
Next season, the farm plans to add pear trees and begin producing pear cider as part of its goal to keep diversifying Mississippi-grown goods. 
The local industry
J&D Blueberry Farm began selling its products at local farmers markets before expanding across the region. Van de Werken said his team sold their baked goods and teas at Oktoberfest in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was selected to take part in the Christmas market in Tomball, Texas — one of only 150 vendors chosen from more than a 1,000 applications. 
Closer to home, the farm is a familiar sight at the Poplarville Blueberry Jubilee, where thousands of visitors sample products and learn about Mississippi’s blueberry industry each year. Events like these, Van de Werken said, are vital to keeping the state’s blueberry community connected and visible. 
But despite strong local support, the number of commercial blueberry farmers in Mississippi has fallen over the past two decades. Van de Werken estimates commercial farms decreased from about 85 growers in 2004 to roughly 15 today — as many longtime farmers retire and few new ones take their place. 
Information from the 2022 Census of Agriculture shows evidence that supports these numbers, but at a slightly different angle. While the number of farmers has increased slightly through Mississippi, the number of acreage on farms has decreased from 2017 to 2022.  
Fewer farms, Van de Werken said, means fewer local jobs and less visibility for a crop once celebrated across the region. 
“There’s not a lot of young people jumping into it,” he said. “You either inherit it or you win the lottery, and you buy a farm. In our case, we started everything from scratch, and I would venture to say to start at our scale, it would cost a million dollars.” 
Van de Werken now serves as president of the Gulf South Blueberry Growers Association, a small network of commercial farmers who meet twice a year to discuss the growing season, market trends and U.S. Department of Agriculture developments. He said the group offers one of the few remaining support systems for growers trying to keep the industry alive. 
Room for improvement

While J&D Blueberry Farm continues to grow, Van de Werken said he’s keeping a close eye on how international competition could reshape the industry.  
The USDA Horticulture Lab in Poplarville developed a variety of blueberry in 2008 known as Southern Highbush, or “Biloxi berry.” The plant has proven highly productive — but not in Mississippi. Instead, it thrives in countries like Peru, Mexico and Colombia, where the climate allows for longer growing seasons and higher yields.  
Van de Werken said he believes Mississippi can still compete by investing in food manufacturing and processing facilities that turn local crops into market-ready products. 
“We would be better off agriculturally and encourage more people to farm,” he said. “Right now, you can only sell so much fresh product before it goes to waste.” 
For Van de Werken, that vision goes beyond his own farm. He said reducing food waste and strengthening local production could give Mississippi’s residents better access to high-quality foods while supporting the next generation of growers.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/23165841/Blueberry_Image_Shop-1.png,,,2025-12-27 09:11:41.268254

Gavin Newsom, to include some people diagnosed with bipolar disorder.","In summary
A California new law expands CARE Court, a mental health program championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, to include some people diagnosed with bipolar disorder.


In 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a new program intended to revolutionize the way counties provide mental health care to some of their most vulnerable residents. 
CARE Court provides a new pathway for the courts to coordinate mental health and substance use treatment, medications and housing placements for people in the grip of psychosis, including those sleeping outside on the street. But CalMatters investigations have found that so far, the program is falling short of expectations. It’s helping far fewer people than projected, it’s struggled to help homeless participants, and some families have had their hopes dashed when CARE Court failed to help their loved ones who can’t consent to treatment.
Senate Bill 27, by Democrat Tom Umberg of Santa Ana, seeks to address some of those concerns. The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, expands who is eligible for CARE Court. Under the original law, only people diagnosed with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders qualified for the program. Now, people who experience psychosis as a result of bipolar disorder can enter the program as well. 
Umberg has said the law could help CARE Court services reach more people, but he doesn’t expect it to dramatically increase the program’s numbers. Counties seem unsure how much of a difference the change will make. San Diego, for example, estimated it could expand its CARE Court program by anywhere between 3.5% and 48.1%.

The law also attempts to make it easier for people to enter CARE Court by smoothing some of the logistical hurdles: It combines two early court hearings into one to reduce the amount of time participants have to spend in court and save administrative resources. 
This law also allows the criminal justice system to refer someone directly into CARE Court if they are charged with a crime and are deemed incompetent to stand trial.
As of the end of October, California courts had received 3,092 CARE Court petitions, approved 684 treatment agreements and ordered 22 CARE plans, according to the Judicial Council of California. Newsom’s administration initially estimated between 7,000 and 12,000 Californians would qualify for CARE Court.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/031923-Newsom-Mental-Health-Presser-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-27 08:56:56.646506

Meet Amanda, Orion and Mariel and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In the months leading up to his election, President Donald Trump insisted that he had nothing to do with the far-right vision for his second administration known as Project 2025, a Christian-nationalist blueprint to remake the federal government. As the year draws to a close, a crowd-sourced effort, as well as trackers from advocacy organizations and labor unions, show that his administration has implemented roughly half of the goals laid out in the document’s 920 pages.
Project 2025 is rooted in injecting narrower interpretations of gender, sexuality and race in federal policy. It calls for ending nearly all of the U.S. government’s efforts to achieve equity, including the collection of data that could be used to track such outcomes across the public and private sectors.
It suggested eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. It also recommended removing out of every rule and regulation terms like sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender equity and gender awareness, along with abortion, reproductive health and reproductive rights.

The blueprint also suggested transforming the FBI into a politically motivated entity, abolishing the Department of Education and dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).
The White House has made progress on all these fronts — through a series of executive orders and also politically motivated hirings, firings and restructurings that have fundamentally expanded the president’s influence and power across all branches of government.
There is a saying in Washington, D.C., that personnel is policy: the people put in charge of implementing key policies shape their ideologies. Russell Vought, one of Project 2025’s key architects, heads Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, which he has likened to the “nerve center” through which a president can exert their influence across the federal government. Peter Navarro, who wrote Project 2025’s section on trade, is a top trade adviser to Trump. Brendan Carr, who wrote a section suggesting reforms to the Federal Communications Commission, is now in charge of the agency.
Here are some specifics on parts of Project 2025 that have been implemented and how they could impact women and LGBTQ+ Americans:

Reproductive rights

Trump maintained throughout the 2024 campaign that if elected, his administration would leave the issue of abortion access to the states. But as of November 2025, his administration had implemented about 40 percent of the Project 2025 policies aimed at restricting reproductive freedoms, according to Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion-rights group.
Project 2025 is grounded in the fundamental premise that abortion is not health care and should not be treated as such by federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment is woven throughout guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services and sub-agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its public health arm. One example is a September 2025 document outlining CDC priorities stating that the agency “will promote the dignity of human life at all stages of development, improve maternal health care, and strengthen the family.”
The document also guides the health department to collect data on people who have abortions, using “every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders.” The CDC confirmed in late November that it would not release an annual state-level report it has produced on U.S. abortions since 1969 — and that would have captured the first full year of data since Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, the Supreme Court case that overturned the federal right to abortion. In a statement to the anti-abortion organization Live Action, a spokesperson for the department attributed the delay to a former chief medical officer “direct[ing] staff to return state-submitted abortion data rather than analyze it.” The Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group that favors abortion access, has pointed out that staffing cuts at the CDC included most of those in its Division for Reproductive Health, leaving the agency short-staffed to compile the data for the report, which is now due out in the first quarter of 2026.
Both the anti-abortion and abortion-rights movements want the report, though for different reasons: the former so it can strategize about how to further reduce the incidence of abortion; the latter so it can assess the impact of the Dobbs decision on abortion access and health care outcomes.
Additional Project 2025 reproductive health priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June rescinded Biden administration guidance that hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid dollars, which is nearly all of them, provide abortion care in emergency situations under EMTALA, a decades-old emergency medicine law.
Revoked a Biden administration-era order establishing an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access designed to ease access to contraception and abortion.
Project 2025 wanted to prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds, even for non-abortion services. This was accomplished when the GOP-led Congress approved Trump’s tax law in July and a federal appeals court in September said the legislation could take effect. Planned Parenthood has said it could result in the closure of as many as 200 clinics — or about one-third of all its health centers — and that 1.1 million could lose access to health care as a result.

The Trump administration did not make much headway on restricting access to the medication abortion drug mifepristone. Medication abortions now account for more than half of all U.S. abortions.
Project 2025 authors want the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its 2000 approval of mifepristone. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in September that he was reviewing Biden administration changes that expanded access via telehealth as well as the drug’s overall efficacy and safety. A less likely near-term possibility is the Department of Justice enforcing the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of obscene materials and articles intended for “producing abortion,” including medication like mifepristone.

LGBTQ+ rights

Project 2025 called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop collecting data on gender identity and for the National Institutes of Health to fund studies into the negative side effects of gender-affirming care for transgender people. So far, these suggestions have largely played out.
At the beginning of the year, federal health agencies, including the CDC, purged website data referencing LGBTQ+ people. This was in response to a White House executive order that demanded agencies erase all traces of “gender ideology” from public statements, as well as policies and internal communications. Although a federal judge’s order has forced agencies to reinstate these webpages, the Trump administration has made it clear that it rejects data collection that includes LGBTQ+ people.
Project 2025 also proposed cutting federal funds for gender-affirming care for both adults and children, mirroring Trump’s own campaign promises. These cuts have taken shape in various ways: through a planned loss of benefits for federal workers, executive pressure placed on hospitals and policy changes that put trans people at risk of losing their insurance coverage or seeing higher out-of-pocket costs next year. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to keep funding hospitals that provide gender-affirming care for trans youth. Still, clinics across the country are closing.

In a broader suggestion, Project 2025 advised the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that expanded federal nondiscrimination protections. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to do just that. The White House has also urged federal agencies to rescind Biden-era policies that support LGBTQ+ rights. Many of these rested on the Biden administration’s interpretation of the Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, which found LGBTQ+ workers to be protected from workplace discrimination. In particular, the Trump White House has chosen to drop transgender and gay students from the government’s interpretation of  Title IX, the civil rights law preventing schools from discriminating against women and girls. This move changes how the federal government investigates Title IX abuses.
In one of its more extreme statements, Project 2025 equates the act of being trans, or “transgender ideology,” to pornography and declares that it should be outlawed. The White House has not made this specific declaration, but it has taken steps to exclude trans Americans from public life — all while referring to trans identity as “gender ideology.”
Additional Project 2025 anti-LGBTQ+ priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

In January, the president signed an executive order signaling his administration’s opposition to gender diversity and trans identity as a whole.
By this spring, the National Institutes of Health had canceled over $800 million in research grants to understand LGBTQ+ health, including studies about cancer and HIV prevention. Most of those cuts were upheld by the Supreme Court.
The White House has ordered NIH to study the regret rates of trans people who receive gender-affirming care, which the Trump administration inaccurately describes as “surgical mutilation.”
The Trump administration has restricted trans Americans’ access to passports that reflect their gender and eliminated the choice to use an X marker instead of male or female.
The Pentagon has swiftly reversed transgender protections and access to health care.

The White House has also signalled support for Project 2025’s sweeping plan to promote and enforce heterosexuality in families, although it has been slower to take direct action.
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, called for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt the official stance that families are made up of a married father, mother and children and to redirect federal funds to support a “biblically based” definition of family. Protecting adoption and foster care services that refuse to work with LGBTQ+ married couples was a key part of this vision in Project 2025.
A recent executive order charges the HHS with addressing local policies that prohibit religious groups — or people with certain religious beliefs — from participating in child-welfare programs.
That is expected to affect more than half the nation — 29 states and Washington, D.C., prohibit discrimination against potential foster parents based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which tracks LGBTQ+ policy. In contrast, 14 states allow child welfare agencies to refuse services to LGBTQ+ families if doing so conflicts with their religious beliefs.

Education

Both Project 2025’s authors and President Trump have long expressed a desire to eliminate the Department of Education. While they do not have the authority to do that, they have taken active steps to weaken the agency, giving more decision-making control to states and school districts.
Project 2025 education priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The president can’t lawfully eliminate a federal agency with an executive order, but he can undermine its functions and redistribute duties. In November, the administration announced that the Education Department’s core functions related to K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies would be transferred to the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services, and State. Critics of the move — including education leaders, elected officials and families with vulnerable children — argue that it will hurt children with disabilities, those from low-income households and student loan borrowers, most of whom are women.
Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to begin a campaign to monitor and influence K-12 curriculum. Among other objectives of the order, the secretary of education was instructed to eliminate federal funding for schools promoting “indoctrination” based on “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.” The order also called for an enforcement plan to make sure schools allow parents full access to their children’s educational records — an issue the administration connects with accessing information on children’s gender ideology.
Project 2025 encouraged Congress to consider school choice legislation. The Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, included a national school voucher plan that set up scholarships for families to attend private schools around the country.

Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the military has moved quickly to align itself with Project 2025’s objectives, with an emphasis on reducing health care access for women and LGBTQ+ service members and an effort to overturn policies tied to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These changes have the potential to influence civilian policies down the line, in part because military policies reflect the values and strategic priorities of an administration and signal what might be coming to other federal departments.
Project 2025 military priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

Project 2025 called to end any public funding of gender-affirming health care for transgender service members. In May, the Pentagon announced it was halting new hormone treatments and surgical procedures.
Project 2025 also said policies allowing transgender people to serve in the military should be reversed. In January, Trump issued an executive order that listed gender dysphoria — identifying with a gender that’s different from the sex assigned at birth — as one of the medical conditions disqualifying people from military service. According to the Defense Health Agency, nearly 2,000 military personnel had that diagnosis as of 2021.
Project 2025 suggested prohibiting the federal government from paying the travel expenses of service members and eligible dependents who cross state borders to obtain abortions — a 2023 policy that was put in place after Roe v. Wade was repealed.  In January, the Pentagon rescinded the Biden-era policy that granted service members three weeks of administrative leave and travel stipends for abortion services.
Project 2025 called for the Pentagon to abolish all DEI offices in the Defense Department; in January, Trump signed an executive order ending all of the military’s diversity programs. Within the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, high-ranking people of color and women were fired, military academies were ordered to eliminate race-conscious admissions, the military announced it would no longer recognize commemoration months and thousands of images promoting diversity and minority milestones were flagged for removal. A new department task force was also created to promote “merit-based, color-blind policies” to ban race and sex considerations from military promotions.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kevin-Roberts-illustration-for-Dec-27-2025-story-1024x683.webp,,,2025-12-27 08:12:08.536993
,Maryland Matters,2025-12-27 12:03:45+00:00,Maryland Matters,Forget the judges: Maryland’s estate system is rigged against families,J.H. Snider,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/27/forget-the-judges-marylands-estate-system-is-rigged-against-families/,"A decades-long battle is raging between Maryland’s Orphans’ Court judges and the Maryland Bar Association over whether our probate judges should be lawyers or laypeople.

The Legislature recently threw down the gauntlet for the latest skirmish, passing legislation during its 2025 session to create a task force ostensibly to study “improving the efficiency, uniformity, and quality” of estate processes.
But this conflict is a sideshow. While the task force focuses narrowly on judges’ credentials, jurisdiction, and elections, it is ignoring the fundamental problems harming Maryland families forced into the government’s labyrinthine estate system.
The Task force met eight times this fall and plans to meet again next spring and then issue a final set of recommendations before it adjourns June 30, 2026.
The stakes are enormous. More than 50,000 Marylanders die each year. The average estate costs between $30,000 and $60,000 to settle, draining assets through legal costs, executor compensation, and government fees. If litigation occurs, costs can easily skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands. Yet, this short-term economic waste pales in comparison to the family estrangement the system causes, inflicting damage that lasts for generations.
The professionals who profit from this system routinely blame families for the conflict. But this blame game sweeps under the rug their own role in fostering that conflict. The root problem is that lawyer interests are aligned with fiduciaries, not beneficiaries, because that is where they earn more than 90% of their fees.
Contrary to fiduciary rhetoric, the actual law incentivizes fiduciaries to act for their own benefit at the expense of less favored beneficiaries. If acted upon, these incentives cause family conflict because a family member is the fiduciary for most estates. While most family members value harmony, the estate process strongly incentivizes bringing existing family stress to a breaking point.
The current task force is a perfect example of this anti-family bias. Every single member of it is either a government official or a representative of the Maryland State Bar Association. There is an old saying in politics: if you aren’t at the table, you are the meal. In this task force, Maryland families are the meal.
The State of Maryland rakes in approximately $235 million annually in “death taxes” but spends only about 15% of that to administer the system. The rest subsidizes other state operations. Politicians remain torn between the fearful power of the lawyers’ trade association—magnified by the fact that roughly a quarter of legislators have law degrees—and a desire not to harm their constituents too blatantly.
If the Legislature genuinely wants to improve the system, it must pursue a “parasite-cleaning” reform agenda.
First, we must automate the disclosure of financial assets and transactions. This was a good idea when the Internet was invented in the 1990s, and it is an even better idea now. Professional fiduciaries continue to oppose this to protect their billable hours and evade accountability.
Second, we must empower AIs to compete with licensed lawyers. The lawyers’ trade association has always fought competition, including the “unauthorized practice of law,” and their resistance to AI is no different. The government should mandate improved public access to estate case law and dockets so that AI models can train on this information and provide affordable legal services.
Third, we must require the elected Registers of Wills to actively educate families. The government currently allows the system to remain opaque; instead, it should mandate that Registers educate families about deadlines, rights, and responsibilities. This information should be automated and customized, but it requires no AI—just a shift in priorities to support Maryland families rather than the donors who contribute to their re-election campaigns.
Finally, we must codify and simplify estate law. The current non-intuitive and complex estate law benefits lawyers more than Maryland families and results in widespread fiduciary practices that mock fiduciary ideals.
In 1853, Charles Dickens’s Bleak House famously observed, “The one great principle of English law is to make business for itself.” Sadly, in the subsequent 172 years, the estate process has become even more skewed against the interests of those it claims to serve.
While the various professional parasites feeding off the system glibly spout talk of championing the public interest, the number of families harmed by the system has increased by orders of magnitude. It is long past time for the Legislature to place the interests of Maryland families first. A task force that actually champions families—rather than those who feed off them—would be a refreshing change.",,,,2025-12-27 07:12:06.252400

I had no idea he would be South Dakota’s next governor.
In 1996, I covered John Thune’s stop in Pierre on his tour announcing that he was running for the U.S. House. I remember thinking that it was a waste of time because there was no way he could win the primary against Lt. Gov. Carol Hillard. Obviously I was in for another surprise.
During the evening of the last three presidential Election Days, I went to bed believing that my country could never elect Donald Trump. One out of three is pretty bad for a prognosticator.
Despite that woeful record for political predictions, I have one for June’s Republican gubernatorial primary. Here goes (drum roll). The candidate who makes the best use of newspaper advertising will do better than expected.

Election 2026
News and commentary on statewide races and ballot questions.
Read the latest>


That means a front-runner like Gov. Larry Rhoden or U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, by using newspaper advertising wisely, could win by a surprising margin. That means the other candidates who have yet to poll as well — Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen — with the right newspaper ad campaign, could punch above their weight class, make the race interesting and perhaps lay the groundwork for their next campaign.
Anyone who reads knows that in the last few elections political advertising in newspapers has been little more than an afterthought. Candidates still like to see their name in the paper, but they prefer not to invest in it. They have their minions write glowing letters to the editor, but they would rather spend their money elsewhere. They clog up the airwaves on TV or throw their money into the ether, buying ads on social media.
Honest, this isn’t just the ramblings of a cranky retired newspaperman. The benefits of newspaper advertising are real because of the readers.
By virtue of the fact that they have purchased a subscription to their local newspaper, readers prove that they have money. Money is something that every candidate, even the rich ones, needs. I’m surprised that all the candidates aren’t running small ads already, asking for money or at least steering readers to their websites where they can gather contact information and then really put the bite on them for donations.
Much more important than their wallets is the fact that newspaper readers are voters. Many studies have shown that people who subscribe to their local newspaper take an interest in their community, their state and their nation. Using Susquehanna Polling and Research Inc., the National Newspaper Association Foundation found that 96% of newspaper readers are voters.
Closer to home, research from the South Dakota NewsMedia Association shows that 83% of adults in the state read newspapers online or in print. Of those readers, 85% vote in state, national and local elections. A candidate looking for success in the next election should consider investing in advertising where the voters are, in newspapers.
Candidates often tell us how smart they are, how much they love innovation, how they know how to govern. Well, watch your local newspaper to see which one of them knows how to get elected by spending some of that hard-earned campaign cash where voters are likely to congregate.
Just as candidates are forced to make some decisions in an election year, so are newspaper editors. Some have innovated in recent years. As they saw political advertising dry up, they decided not to be used by political campaigns. Some had the foresight and guts to start charging for letters to the editor that include the endorsement of a candidate. That’s a smart decision. Those letters on the opinion page are nothing more than free political advertising, often cranked out by the very campaigns that have forsaken newspaper advertising.


Let us know what you think...


 

Another decision facing newspaper editors is what to do with Rhoden’s weekly column. Now that he’s a declared candidate for governor, it’s unfair to his competitors that he should get free space in the newspaper every week.
There may be some editors who argue that a column from the governor of the state is newsworthy. If that’s the case, it’s likely those editors have been too lazy to read what they’re putting in their newspapers.
Since declaring his candidacy, the topics of Rhoden’s columns have included how thankful he is to be the governor; how hard he’s working on the next budget — with a bit of his legislative background thrown in; and how his budget supports student success. That last one is a bit of a stretch given that the budget he worked so hard on didn’t include a funding increase for education.
The governor’s column isn’t news; it’s a way for him to polish his resume in public. Editors should consider putting the column on hiatus until Rhoden is no longer a candidate for office.
Election years are always interesting and this one is shaping up to hold voters’ attention, at least through the primary. Up until then, watch your newspaper to see which of the GOP candidates for governor has the smarts to advertise directly to voters and which editors are actually reading what they put in their newspaper.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/591A8138-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-27 07:12:06.252400

At the same time, efforts to expand Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act remain stalled in Lansing.
Director of the Eastern Michigan University Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur Institute for Civic Education calls it a “perfect storm” for democracy.
The public’s right to know
FOIA is a fundamental tool for journalists and citizens. Most local and state offices are subject to FOIA. That means government officials must answer requests made for public records in a timely manner and without high fees.
However, in Michigan, these FOIA expectations look a little different. Public records are not available from the office of the governor and the state legislature, restricting access to the public’s ability to understand some government operations.
At Bridge Michigan, a nonprofit organization covering state government policies, FOIA is a valuable resource for its reporting. Joel Kurth, Bridge’s executive editor of impact, emphasized the importance of laws like FOIA that support government transparency.
“We are stridently nonpartisan and not opinionated about anything beyond government transparency and the people’s right to access the basic doings of their government that they pay for,” Kurth said.
Joel Kurth, Bridge Michigan’s executive editor of impact
Bridge’s political coverage goes hand in hand with their mission to inform the public. The news organization collaborates with universities and other outlets to promote dialogue with the community, according to Kurth.
“We try to have a virtuous cycle, where the journalism informs the engagement, and the engagement informs the journalism,” Kurth said.
Education marginalized
In the 21st Century, civic engagement has become inextricably linked with technology and media literacy. Brigid Beaubien, the director of Eastern Michigan University’s Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur Institute for Civic Education, said that the definition of media literacy has evolved since the rise of social media.
As a social studies education professor, Beaubien works with her students on developing strategies for talking about and teaching civics.
“We’ve moved so fast in the last 25 years in this world that nobody’s really stopped and thought intentionally about how this should be addressed,” Beaubien said. “When I started in my career, both as a teacher and as a professor, [media literacy] wasn’t even something we really had to think about. We as a society need to focus on building knowledge and critical thinking skills.”
Brigid Beaubien, the director of Eastern Michigan University’s Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur Institute for Civic Education
A 2023 Michigan study by social studies leaders found that elementary social studies instruction is severely marginalized due to standardized testing pressures in reading and math. Surveying nearly 1,000 educators, the Michigan Council for the Social Studies, “State of Elementary Social Studies” report revealed limited class time, resources, and professional development for teaching social studies.
Beaubien also highlighted the importance of civility in politics and online, something she said she sees as a core aspect of media literacy and civic education.
“We need to make sure we’re building deliberative dialogue, that people understand what discourse looks like in a way that’s civil and promotes problem solving and not just attacking the other side,” Beaubien said. “I think we really have to tease apart this belief polarization, where when we’re with people who believe the same way we do, our belief about the other side becomes more vehement.”
In the Michigan Legislature, where bills to expand the state’s public information law have stalled in both chambers for nearly a decade, that belief polarization is not uncommon.
Public Policy Manager at the Michigan Press Association Lisa McGraw said that despite public support for FOIA expansion, neither Democrats or Republicans have championed the public’s right to know.
“Everyone, when they’re running for office, says they’re going to do it, and then somehow it doesn’t make it,” McGraw said. “I could never say that any one party has held this up. Often it is the majority that holds it up…because they all know it’s going to apply to them.”
McGraw said she sees that delay as damaging to public trust in the government and media.
“We are suffering a crisis in journalism from a lack of trust, and that gets exponentially bigger when you look at public officials,” McGraw said.
Advisor of the Delta Collegiate Crystal McMorris
Educating media consumers
At Delta College, Journalism Professor, Program Coordinator, and Advisor of the Delta Collegiate Crystal McMorris teaches a popular media literacy course. She said that college students make up a big part of the shifting audience of traditional media.
“Students are tending to be more interested in trending videos with 15-second audios than they are in an in-depth investigation,” McMorris said. “The appetite for that kind of news just doesn’t seem to be there with the audience my students are creating for.”
In the digital age and with the increased use of generative artificial intelligence, McMorris said there needs to be a greater emphasis on educating media consumers about accuracy and authenticity.
“Diverse opinions and approaches are what make our country great,” McMorris said. “But when we don’t even have shared facts…I do fear for the future of democracy.”
Diminishing trust in media and government goes hand-in-hand with the lack of civic education students of all levels receive, according to Beaubien.
“I think most public servants go in with the best intentions and I think the two-party system has set up a structure that rewards polarization,” Beaubien said. “At the same time, we’ve reduced social studies in the classroom. It’s like a perfect storm.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9248-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-27 07:12:06.252400

The free guided hikes allow visitors to get outdoors, snap photos, look for wildlife and participate in special events, which include a potluck soup luncheon at Ash Hollow State Historical Park near Lewellen and a tour of the James Family Conservatory and Nature Center at Mahoney State Park near Ashland.
The hikes vary in length, and at Branched Oak State Recreation Area, the “hike” is actually on horseback. Dogs, on a leash, are welcome. Visitors must have a valid state park entry permit.
First Day Hikes have been a tradition at state parks since 1992, when a state park outside of Boston invited visitors for a hike on Jan. 1. By 2017, an estimated 62,000 hikers participated in First Day Hikes, which are offered in all 50 states.
The Nebraska state parks, historical parks and recreation areas offering First Day Hikes are: Ash Hollow, Chadron, Mahoney, Fort Hartsuff, Fort Kearny, Indian Cave, Johnson Lake, Lake Ogallala, Mormon Island, Platte River, Ponca, Red Willow, Rock Creek Station, Schramm Park, Wagon Train, Wildcat Hills and Windmill.

(Photo by Jim Peaco/National Park Service)This story was first published by WyoFile on Dec. 18, 2025.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population continues to stagnate geographically, a relatively new trend that wildlife managers say is related to bears saturating “suitable habitat” where the species is tolerated.
That finding is described in a new and first-ever rangewide report summarizing where grizzly bears are found in the Lower 48.
Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.
Grizzly bears occupy an estimated 59,000 square miles of habitat throughout all their recovery zones in the Lower 48. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.”
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble.
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.”
The occupied grizzly bear range in the Yellowstone region is retreating slightly and encompasses an estimated 26,100 square miles, nearly two thirds of which is located in Wyoming. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that.
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’”
 Range for grizzlies stopped expanding

Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles.
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window.
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reached the Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.
Federal judge strikes down logging project near Yellowstone National Park

Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.
Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll this year is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities.
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies).
This year, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average.
 Where grizzly bear habitats are retreating

Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019.
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
Last year, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range.
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.”
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

The CT Mirror published more than 50 “Charting Connecticut” stories this year, usually on Fridays.
Here are 10 top Charting Connecticut stories — some because of high reader engagement, some because they were staff favorites — from this year, in no particular order.
1. For a ‘land of steady habits,’ CT has seen changes over 10 years
“The land of steady habits,” a description of Connecticut coined in the 1800s, has changed. This story featured 10 charts looking back at the past 10 years.
One of the biggest takeaways is migration; more people from New York move to Connecticut than from any other state. And while people do move from Connecticut to New York, Connecticut has seen more newcomers from New York. 
Other changes we looked at include housing affordability across the state, employment rates, overdose deaths, voter registration, tuition prices, high-needs students in public schools, reliance on government aid, temperature in the state and immigration court backlogs. (Published Jan. 24)
2. SNAP benefit cuts to families in CT will hit harder than any other state
A number of sweeping revisions being made by the Trump administration have led to tumultuous changes, which have trickled down to Connecticut in more ways than one, including through major changes to eligibility criteria for the federal food assistance program SNAP. 
Connecticut families previously receiving $25 or more a month in SNAP benefits were estimated to lose nearly $200 a month on average under the Big Beautiful Bill Act, according to an Urban Institute report. This average loss is higher in Connecticut than any other state in the nation. (Published Oct. 24)
3. Over 100K CT residents could lose Medicaid coverage. What towns may be hit hardest?
Like SNAP benefits, Medicaid also took a hit this year as eligibility requirements changed at the federal level; an estimated 100,000 to 170,000 people in the state would be impacted.
Data found that residents in Hartford, Waterbury and New Britain could be heavily affected. Data shows that New Haven and Bridgeport could also see a large number of their residents lose benefits. But unlike with SNAP, Connecticut was not among the most affected states in the nation. (Published Sept. 5)
4. CT salaries are among the highest in the U.S. So is its cost of living
Housing costs remain a hot topic in the state and the nation, and the numbers reflect that.
While Connecticut has the eighth-highest salaries in the nation, when adjusted for a high cost of living, the state’s average salary becomes the ninth-highest in the nation. And to live comfortably in the state, a single person would need to make $100,380 annually, or a two-parent household with children would need a combined income of $279,884, one of the highest in the country.
The story features a chart with the state ranking for cost of living and a searchable table for readers to find the average salary for their own job out of all jobs in the state. (Published April 25)
5. Environmental bills lead start of CT legislative session
The beginning of the year also brought the beginning of the 2025 legislative session. On the first day of session, 377 pieces of legislation had been filed in the House and the Senate. 
In the House and the Senate, there were more bills related to environmental issues than anything else. Environmental legislation accounted for 21.5% of the 65 bills filed by the House on day one and 12.5% of the 312 bills introduced in the Senate.
Taking second in both chambers were bills dealing with finance, accounting for 17% in the House and 10% in the Senate. But third place is where the House and Senate diverted from each other. The Transportation Committee ended up handling 11% of the first-day legislation from the House, while public health measures took bronze in the Senate, making up 8% of bills filed.

6. We tracked over 100 bills during CT’s 2025 legislative session. Where’d they end up?
The Connecticut Mirror continued to keep up with bills introduced in session, and our bill tracker detailed the progress of the bills that the staff determined were most important to follow. 
Around half the 107 bills tracked by the CT Mirror did not make it through both chambers, and some died in committee. Thirty-two were rolled into other legislation, many in the state budget, and 21 made it to the governor’s desk. (Published July 4)
 7. Sports betting is on the rise in CT. Who is cashing in?
In March, Charting Connecticut delved into sports betting, legalized statewide in 2021. And we found that Connecticut residents are definitely gambling, especially online, to the benefit of the state. 
More than $6.2 billion was wagered on sports in Connecticut, $5.9 billion online and $338 million at in-person locations, also known as retail betting. The first two months of 2025 exceeded 2023 in terms of the dollar amount of bets placed. 
Of the total gross gaming revenue, about 13.3% goes to the state as tax revenue and 3.0% goes to the federal government in taxes. (Published March 28)

8. The price of a cup of coffee in CT is up 7.7%. It could be worse.
In October, we wrote about the increasing prices of one of the most popular drinks in the nation: coffee. Due to widespread drought in some of the largest coffee-growing regions of the world, as well as Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, the price of coffee got a hike this year.
In fact, data collected by Toast, a popular restaurant operations platform, found that Connecticut coffee prices jumped 7.7% 2025 compared to 2024. While this is a large change in price, other states saw larger jumps, some reaching 11%. (Published Oct. 10)
 9. New Haven-area ER visitors more likely to report suicidal thoughts
This story made the list for some of the important trends it uncovers: residents in certain areas of the state are more likely to report suicidal thoughts than residents in others.
But experts say this may be because of the comfort level of residents, not an actual trend. And many believe this is a positive finding, because if suicidal thoughts are being reported, doctors are able to intervene and provide the necessary care. 
ER data also found that residents aged 10 through 17 had the highest rates of suicidal ideation, out of the 38,000 visits in which suicidal ideation was present. (Published Aug. 22)
10. Which CT towns have the most children of foreign-born parents?
This story was published in January, but the Supreme Court’s impending decision on birthright citizenship keeps it in the news, as it could have far-reaching impacts on immigration in Connecticut and across the nation. 
We reported which towns in the state have the most children to foreign-born parents. 
Bridgeport has an estimate of over 16,000 children with at least one foreign-born parent (55.3%), followed by Stamford with almost 14,000 children (55.9%) and Danbury with a little over 10,500 (63.8%).

Wes. Moore (D) in his fiscal 2026 budget. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)Health care advocates and state officials labeled the past year “stressful,” “frustrating” and “crazy” — from a jarring transition in federal policies under the Trump administration to an ongoing state financial crisis that limits progress in boosting access to care.
And while the legislature and advocates took steps to mitigate some of the impacts of the new federal health policies, many are ready to leave 2025 behind.
“I wouldn’t replay 2025 again,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society. “But it could have been a lot worse.”
That said, many of the stressors that plagued Maryland’s 2025 health care landscape will reemerge or influence policy in upcoming years.
As lawmakers look ahead to the 2026 session, here are some of the major points in health care this past year that could have continuing implications in coming years.
HR 1 health care overhaul
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) pointed to the rapid and wide-ranging changes to federal health care operations as a major point of frustration for the health system in Maryland.
“It’s just been a crazy year when it comes to health care because of all the federal policy changes,” Lam said.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) agreed.
“We couldn’t even begin to anticipate all of the things that were going to happen,” she said.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

One of the biggest blows came in the form of the budget reconciliation bill, HR 1, often referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Among its sweeping changes, the legislation will usher in new requirements to qualify for Medicaid, the joint federal and state health care plan often used by lower-income families.
About 330,000 Marylanders are part of the “expansion population” and would be subject to new work requirements to qualify for coverage, which would take effect no later than 2028. Opponents argue that most recipients are already working, and that they are more likely to be tripped up by the increased paperwork that will be needed to prove that they are fulfilling the 80-hour-per-month requirement.
“There’s going to be people who are going to lose their care,” Beidle said. “It’s really going to be sad, because if they don’t pay for their health insurance … they’re going to be at our hospitals which are already really overcrowded.”
Lam said that the legislature was able to correctly predict some of the policy changes that President Donald Trump’s administration had in store and put some state-level protections in place during the 2025 session.
The General Assembly created laws to mandate insurance companies cover certain vaccinations, regardless of federal changes that weaken recommendations for some shots including for COVID-19.
The Legislature also correctly assumed that Congress would not extend a popular health care tax credit on plans purchased through Affordable Care Act marketplaces before it expires at the end of the year. Lawmakers were able to move some funding to help offset that financial impact to some of the lowest-income families using the state marketplace, though others will likely see their monthly health care costs increase regardless.
But Lam says complying with HR 1 will create hurdles for the state in future years.
“The HR 1 bill that passed puts at risk a lot of the gains we’ve made when it comes to expanding coverage for Medicaid patients. Things like work requirements and burdens and documentation are now all being imposed on a population that is just struggling to put food on the table with the rising cost of everything,” Lam said. “They are now being required to jump through a lot of hoops just to maintain their health coverage.”
Work AHEAD: State, federal officials finalizing terms of new hospital system in Maryland

Full speed ‘AHEAD’
The state’s current hospital payment system called the Total Cost of Care model will end on Dec. 31. What will replace it is a new system referred to as the AHEAD model – a hospital payment system that was first negotiated last year under the Biden administration and then revamped under the Trump administration.
State health officials had been in negotiations with the Trump administration since the start of the year. In the months since, state and federal officials have gone back and forth about how much authority Maryland should have in dictating hospital rates.
“Every week it changed,” Beidle said. “Once they finally got it signed … the hospitals had a very short time to sign the participation agreements. And there were some last-minute changes for that. I think the unknown made it really difficult.”
State documents even show a name change for the new hospital payment model. Under the Biden administration “AHEAD” stood for “Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development.” The new agreement changes that to “Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design,” reflecting a move away from the state’s current “all-payer” model that allows health care costs to be consistent across all types of insurance.
Among many changes under the new agreement, Maryland is set to lose its ability to set hospital rates under Medicare, an authority it has held for over 40 years. Losing that authority could complicate how the state keeps costs consistent across health care plans, meaning that people on private plans, Medicare or Medicaid may pay different prices for the same type of care down the line.
The new agreement keeps much of the state’s hospital payment system in place for two years, giving officials time to implement larger policy changes.
Ransom says the two-year timeframe gives the health care system a chance to take “a deep breath.”
“Two years of stability is nice,” he said. “But there’s still a lot of work to do — a lot of complexity that has not been worked out.”
Seniors notified of Medicare Advantage plans ending
Thousands of Maryland seniors notified of the end of their Medicare Advantage plans

Thousands of senior Marylanders were shocked to learn that their Medicare Advantage plans would not be available for the upcoming year, leaving them to scramble to find other plans that may be more expensive, or go without.
About a quarter of Maryland Medicare recipients use a program called Medicare Advantage that helps retirees use a private insurer for additional health coverage such as vision, dental and transportation assistance that the standard Medicare plans may not offer.
But insurance companies say offering Medicare Advantage plans is uniquely costly in Maryland. Insurers are fleeing the state or reducing their coverage.
Industry experts say as many as 100,000 Medicare recipients in Maryland will have to scramble to find a new health care plan by the end of the year or risk losing coverage at an age where many require costly medical care.
Under the AHEAD agreement, Maryland officials are tasked with finding ways to stabilize the Medicare Advantage market. Those talks are likely to begin in the upcoming session.
“We’re going to be dealing with the Medicare Advantage issue, which has turned out to be a really big issue for this year,” Beidle said.
Budget deficit looms once again
Laura Howell, CEO for the Maryland Association of Community Services, fears that a more than $1.4 billion deficit in the coming year could mean another round of intense advocacy to ensure that any cuts to funding don’t impact developmental disability resources.
After rocky legislature, disability agency’s self-directed care may still face budget challenges

Advocates, family members, and care takers came out in droves last session to stave off what was originally proposed to be over $400 million in cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration. Advocates were able to claw back close to $300 million in cuts and got program reductions to a level they said was regrettable but survivable, at least.
“The big question becomes, what are we looking at for the ‘27 budget?” Howell said. “I think the administration has made it pretty clear that they want to be working with the developmental disability advocates going into this session and during session.”
“We’re looking at an overall deficit, so we worry what that will mean for the DDA budget,” she said. “But I do think there is more communication with us than there was going into last session.”
But Beidle warned throughout the health care system, the tight financial outlook for the state could create challenges.
“It’s a money issue. It’s going to be tough year for funding – whether it’s DDA or Medicaid Advantage or the hospitals,” she said. “If the money’s not there, it’s not there.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC_0554-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-27 06:56:38.992893

Naps get a bad rap in our society, probably because they connote laziness or idleness. But in my experience, brief snoozes in fact do the opposite. They allow for more focused attention. They open the door to unusual problem-solving approaches. And if you eventually hit another wall, at least you’re slightly better rested.

Little things

Not all naps are created equal. If you sleep for only two hours one night and then fall asleep for most of an afternoon, that’s not really a nap. That’s making up for lost time.
No, I’m writing about an intentionally short period of closing your eyes and recharging.
My optimal nap is between 20 and 40 minutes. It’s long enough to allow myself to drift away, but not so long that I totally lose consciousness or momentum. If the nap ends and I have to remember where I am and what I’m doing, that nap was too long.
Oftentimes, I’ll nap because I’m either temporarily tired or a bit overwhelmed with the situation at hand. Those minutes spent behind the gray shade of my eyelids allow me to reset, reconsider and come into myself.
Words and phrases work their way into my mind as I settle down. The act of napping frequently turns into an impromptu brainstorming session, as I activate my phone to type various notes to myself. I can scroll through those notes now and read various ideas for columns, ledes that didn’t pan out, entire columns that dropped by the wayside.
“Destruction not easily reversible,” reads one optimistic phrase.
“No one else wanted to write about Trump,” reads another one, oddly enough.
“In the darkest timeline, we have already lost this state and country” begins an entire column that I hope won’t appear anytime soon.
You get the idea. Something about laying back and clearing out my conscious mind allows words and thoughts to congeal. You have to be receptive, of course; when I wrote less frequently I would tune out these transmissions. Not today. I’ve decided they’re my brain giving me free content.
On a serious level, we all need more sleep. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than a third of Kansans — 36.7% of us — went without adequate sleep in 2022. That’s defined as less than seven hours per night.
If you’re like me, I know your response: Somebody’s getting seven hours of sleep per night?
The problem with achieving a solid seven or eight hours of shuteye is that it feels like such a commitment. I love to sleep, don’t get me wrong, but what if you remember an important task that needs completing? What if you need to write a column for the next day? What if your child’s entire science fair project about algae hasn’t even been conceived of, much less built?
Here’s my point (and I do have one): We should treat sleep more casually. Let’s drop the hangups. Take a nap if we need one, sleep a little later if we need to. Be good to ourselves and our bodies, and the unconscious brains that run everything from the top.
Now, if you don’t mind, I need to go lie down.
