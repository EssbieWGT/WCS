(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The first fish that Republican former state Sen. V.J. Smith ever caught was from a dock when he was a young boy.
Today, dozens of new docks are available for kids to share that same thrill, thanks to funding Smith helped create. 
South Dakota’s Habitat Stamp fee has become a cornerstone in the state’s strategy to improve wildlife habitat and expand public access for outdoor recreation since the stamp’s inception five years ago.
“It’s a small price to pay for the critters that were here long before we were,” Smith said.

The stamp is a required extra purchase of $10 for state residents and $25 for non-residents when buying a hunting, trapping or fishing license. It was instituted by the state Legislature and sponsored by Smith, of Brookings, who described it as “an insurance policy for the future” of the state’s outdoor heritage. 
Every dollar of the stamp is required by law to go toward wildlife habitat and public access projects. The stamp has raised $21.6 million in its first five years, and the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks has so far spent $14 million on about 1,300 projects. The money is divided roughly equally between water and land-based efforts.
The water projects have included rehabilitating aging dams, constructing and improving boat ramps and fishing piers, dredging and aerating lakes, and restoring habitats such as rock reefs and stream banks. 
On land, the department focuses on seeding native grasses and wildflowers, planting trees and shrubs, improving access roads and trails, and supporting programs that compensate private landowners who open their land to public recreation.
The stamp’s origins
After watching fellow lawmakers debate a one-time, $1 million transfer to a habitat fund in 2019, Smith said he and others saw the need for a permanent, self-funded solution. Surrounding states already had habitat and conservation fees tied to license sales. 
The next year, the stamp bill passed with bipartisan support. 
“The legislation would never have passed without the endorsement of the outdoor groups,” Smith said.
Smith said one of the key players was the Brookings area chapter of the South Dakota Wildlife Federation, including chapter member and retired state waterfowl biologist Spencer Vaa, who inspired Smith to introduce the bill. 
“He enlightened me on the needs of wildlife and the importance of habitat,” Smith said. “A lot of people deserve credit for this. You need a lot of people to get stuff done.”

Jeff Olson, of the Black Hills Sportsmen Club and Black Hills Flyfishers, said some hunters and anglers were initially skeptical of the stamp, and worried it might become “just another tax.” But five years later, he said the results speak for themselves.
Olson pointed to Pactola Reservoir, a popular man-made lake in the Black Hills, and the stamp-funded work local anglers and the department have been doing to add fish habitat structures and improve shoreline access below the reservoir. He said the projects help to make Rapid Creek, which feeds the lake and runs through Rapid City, a prime fishing spot. 
“We wouldn’t have been able to do a lot of the recent fisheries projects we’ve gotten done, like the one below Pactola Reservoir, without those stamp dollars,” Olson said.
Insurance policy for the future
Retired wildlife biologist George Vandel, who now lobbies in Pierre on behalf of the South Dakota Wildlife Federation, called the stamp “one of the smartest investments hunters and anglers have ever made.” 
Vandel said the fee pays for habitat and access improvements that would be “nearly impossible” to secure through South Dakota’s Legislature, where “it’s a fight” to secure funding. 
Nevertheless, a few concerns remain. Vandel mentioned an exemption that allows shooting‐preserve customers to avoid paying the fee. Those are privately owned and managed lands where pen-raised game birds (and sometimes other animals) are released to be shot by customers. He said that was a compromise made during the bill’s passage, with preserves arguing they do not impact wildlife numbers. Vandel wants to apply the fee to preserves and bring in more revenue for Habitat Stamp projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some western South Dakota hunters and anglers, including Olson, say investments have been more concentrated in the eastern part of the state. Of the $14 million spent so far, $4.5 million was spent in western counties. 
Regardless, for outdoor enthusiasts, the narrative is clear: The annual fee provides a tangible return. As Vandel puts it, “The $10 you spend is half a box of shells or a six pack of beer. This is a direct return on your investment. There’s no administrative overhead, it’s just money on the ground.”
Vandel praised the stamp’s results, from new boat ramps and shoreline access to grassland and food-plot restoration. He also pointed to the public access programs as essential to maintaining hunting opportunities. 
“Sportsmen and women have to realize you get what you pay for, and if you want cheap, that’s exactly what you’ll end up with: less habitat, less access, and fewer game,” Vandel said. 
 



 Where the money goes

South Dakota’s Habitat Stamp has funded about 1,300 projects since the program began five years ago:

33.6 miles of new trails.
41 dams repaired.
3,000 acres of forest and grassland habitat enhancements.
41 fish-habitat structures built.
956 wildlife food plots created.
36 new docks and piers.
49 new boat ramps and launches.
5,000 acres of native prairie restored.
14.8 miles of wildlife-friendly fencing installed.
212,000 acres enrolled in public access to private land programs.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EM8A3485-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-30 14:57:26.925169

Kevin Harris for the District 27 Senate seat, giving him a three-county sweep, David Trone may be looking into a run for his old House seat against Rep. April McClain Delaney, plus appointments in political notes.","Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George's) during a committee hearing in 2023, his first year in office. Harris won the nomination over the weekend to fill the District 27 Senate seat vacated recently by Michael Jackson. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Calvert County Democratic Central Committee voted Saturday to endorse Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) for the vacant District 27 Senate seat, giving Harris a sweep of all three counties in the district.
The final vote, according to Calvert Central Committee Chair Cindy Yoe, was seven votes for Harris and three votes for Jason Fowler, an attorney who ran unsuccessfully for the District 27C House seat in 2018.
The Calvert County vote follows Democrats in Charles County, who went 9-1 for Harris over Fowler last Saturday, and Prince George’s County Democrats, where the 26 central committee members present at Tuesday’s meeting cast 16 votes for Harris and 10 for Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Prince George’s and Calvert).
The Senate seat covers three House subdistricts that sprawl over the three counties: District 27A, currently held by Harris, includes parts of Charles and Prince George’s counties; District 27B, held by Long, includes parts of Prince George’s and Calvert counties; and District 27C, held by Republican Del. Mark Fisher, is all central Calvert County. All three counties had to weigh in on a nominee, which will be forwarded to the governor.
For those keeping score at home, Harris got 32 votes from the three counties to 10 for Long and four for Fowler. But the important number is 3-0: In an Oct. 21 letter, the attorney general’s office said that each county gets one vote in the selection of a nominee, and Harris got all three. The same letter said that if the counties were split, the majority would still win and only one name would be sent to the governor, so Harris essentially had the nomination sewed up on Tuesday.
The nomination now goes to Gov. Wes Moore (D), who has two weeks to officially appoint him to the Senate seat that was held by Democrat Michael Jackson until Nov. 11, when Jackson — a former Prince George’s County sheriff — took over as the new superintendent of the Maryland State Police.
Assuming Harris’ nomination is endorsed by Moore, the Democratic central committees in Charles and Prince George’s counties will have to meet again to nominate a replacement for the District 27A seat Harris, a first-term member of the House, is leaving behind. They’re on a tight schedule if they want a delegate seated in time for the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 legislative session.
Delaney to Trone to McClain Delaney to … Trone?

The only problem is incumbent Democratic Rep. April McClain Delaney has already announced her reelection bid and started lining up endorsements.
Attempts to reach Trone were unsuccessful. But Inside Elections’ Jacob Rubashkin first reported last week that there was a poll circulating in the district asking people how they would vote in a Democratic primary between Trone and McClain Delaney.
The 23-question poll obtained by Rubashkin asks boilerplate questions about registration and political leanings. It also asks how “appealing” the poll-taker finds McClain Delaney, after describing her as a representative who is “showing up everywhere to fight for hard-working Maryland families,” and Trone, after describing him as a congressman who “stood up against [President Donald] Trump’s abuses of power, voting to impeach him twice.”
But the poll rely leans into it in a series of questions that claim McClain Delaney has voted with Trump more often than any other Democrat in the Maryland delegation and questioning her votes on immigration and criminal justice reform, among others. A follow-up series of questions paint Trone as a relentless defender of Obamacare and abortion rights, and an opponent of Trump during his time in Congress.
McClain Delaney’s campaign responded with a statement noting that her reelection has already been endorsed by every Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation as well as “the Governor, the Lt Governor, the Attorney General … and she looks forward to continuing to fight for the progress needed by Maryland’s Sixth District at this critical moment.”
She has also racked up other endorsements, as well, from unions, environmental and reproductive rights groups, and political organizations like EMILYs List and the New Dems Action Fund, among others.

Tiernan Donohue, the chief campaigns officer for EMILYs List, noted in a statement that Trone, who founded Total Wine and More, spent $60 million of his own fortune in a failed 2024 Democratic primary bid against current Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.). She defended McClain Delaney’s record and said that, “Should Trone decide to run in 2026, Marylanders are going to once again reject his attempt to buy his way back into Congress.”
Should Trone run against McClain Delaney, it would pit two millionaire candidates against one another. In addition to Trone spending heavily on his own race in 2024, McClain Delaney loaned almost $3.9 million to her campaign last year, and has already loaned her campaign $400,000 this year, according to her latest Federal Election Commission filing. That report showed that McClain Delaney had $591,000 in cash on hand as of Sept. 30.
New faces at Governor’s Office for Children
The Governor’s Office for Children has tapped a former federal government official and a longtime worker in nonprofit organizations for key leadership roles in the office.
Special Secretary Carmen Martin said last week that Eric Morrisette will join the office as deputy secretary and Ojeda Hall-France will serve as executive director of the ENOUGH Initiative.
“Eric and Ojeda’s unparalleled experience serving families and communities will be vital to the state’s work in this critical moment,” Martin said in a statement announcing the appointments. “With experience championing transformational policy initiatives, building public-private partnerships, and creating positive change at the intersections between communities and government, Eric and Ojeda are proven leaders to meet this moment.”
Morrisette is the former acting under secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce, where he led the Minority Business Development Agency, and where he previously served as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and deputy assistant secretary for legislative and intergovernmental affairs. He also worked in the U.S. House and Senate, and served in both analysis and operations at the CIA, according to Martin’s statement.
It said Morrisette will oversee the office’s policy priorities, including managing cross-agency initiatives to support children and boost economic mobility.

	Hall-France will oversee the administration of ENOUGH — Gov. Wes Moore’s Engaging Neighborhoods, Organizations, Unions, Governments and Households Initiative — having previously led a community organization participating in the ENOUGH program.
She most recently served as executive director of the Child First Authority, which supports 12 community Schools and eight out-of-school-time programs in Baltimore City, according to the statement, which praised her “rich background in community organizing, systems‑change leadership, and nonprofit management.” Hall-France has also been president of the One Love Foundation and spent more than a decade as a community organizer with the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), the statement said.
Farlow named to Worcester District Court
Worcester County Assistant State’s Attorney Michael “Mike” Farlow has been appointed to a seat on the county’s district court, Gov. Wes Moore announced last week.
“Mike Farlow is a dedicated public servant whose career as a prosecutor and private attorney has prepared him well for the bench,” Moore’s statement said. “His commitment to the people of Worcester County, both in the courtroom and through his extensive community service, is a testament to the integrity and fairness he will bring to the district court. We are proud to see him serve in this new role.”
Farlow has been a prosecutor for the past seven years. Before that he was in private practice in Ocean Pines, where his practice concentrated on major traffic offenses, criminal law, asset forfeiture law, and wills and trusts, the governor’s office said. He also worked part-time as a prosecutor for the state’s attorney from 2003 to 2010.
Farlow, who ran unsuccessfully for state’s attorney in 2014, was the youngest elected official in Maryland when he was elected a Pittsville town commissioner at age 19. He has been recognized for his work with the Snow Hill Volunteer Fire Department and the Pittsville Volunteer Fire Department, and was recently inducted into the Maryland State Firemen’s Association Hall of Fame, according to the governor’s office. Farlow earned his law degree from the Widener University School of Law.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0044-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-30 12:57:40.427799

The moment became one of the most important events in the Civil Rights movement of the mid-20th Century.
At the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation, visitors can see the real bus where Rosa Parks made her historic decision. Museum leaders say the free admission day is a chance for families, students, and community members to learn more about her life and to think about how one person’s courage can spark big change. 
They hope people use the day to remember her strength, her kindness, and her lasting impact on both Montgomery and Detroit.

On December 1, 1955, Parks, a Black woman, was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white man. Her courage helped to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which became an important event in the Civil Rights movement. People across the country saw how unfair the bus rules were and began speaking out for equal rights.
Even though many people know Parks for what happened in Alabama, she also has a strong and important connection to Detroit. She moved to Detroit in 1957 and lived there for more than 40 years until her death in 2005.
David Hecker: Students should be taught the truth about Rosa Parks and other civil rights leaders

Former Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm on October 25, 2005, issued the following statement on the passing of Parks: 
“As the mother of the modern day civil rights movement, Rosa Parks will serve as a role model for generations to come,” Granholm said. “She embodied the courage that is so important to the world we live in.  Her quiet strength, dignity and persistence in the face of racial inequality and persecution were an inspiration to all Americans, regardless of race or gender.  We are proud that she adopted Michigan as her home, a place she loved as much as we will always love her.”
In Detroit, she kept working for justice. Parks worked for Congressman John Conyers, a Democrat, and helped people in the community every day. She supported youth groups, spoke out against poverty, and stood up against unfair housing rules and police violence.

Many Detroiters remember her not only as a national hero, but as someone who cared deeply about local families and young people.
In Detroit, several places honor her legacy. A U.S. Post Office is named after her, and the Transit Center in downtown Detroit also carries her name. These landmarks help people remember how Rosa Parks worked for fairness and equality throughout her life.

It is not just about technology; it’s about meeting people where they are and supporting them in ways that make sense for their lives. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Roz King: From libraries to lifelines, how Vermont reinvents rural health care.","This commentary is by Roz King, M.S.N., R.N., of South Burlington. She serves as the chief of research for the department of emergency medicine at the Larner College of Medicine. She is a clinical translational scientist whose work focuses on improving access to care and health outcomes in rural and underserved communities.


For families in Vermont’s rural towns, getting to a medical provider or clinic can be challenging. Long drives, limited transportation and busy work schedules often mean that health care takes a back seat, until a routine health need becomes something more serious.
As a clinical translational scientist and emergency medicine nurse, I see how these barriers affect people every day, and how creative, community-rooted solutions can make a lasting difference.  
Navigating state-level hospital oversight and evolving federal requirements can be complex and, at times, frustrating, but it also creates opportunities for new ways of delivering care. Emergency medicine thrives on thinking fast and adapting under pressure. It is this same mindset that is well-suited to addressing Vermont’s rural health care needs.
Across Vermont, we are finding ways to deliver care beyond the four walls of our institutions, through libraries, mobile clinics and interprofessional student-community partnerships. Sometimes the toughest constraints spark the most impactful ideas.
One example of this community-centered innovation is VITAL VT (Virtual Integration for Telehealth Access through Libraries in Vermont) funded by the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships. In many rural towns, broadband gaps, unreliable internet, and discomfort with digital tools can make virtual care hard to access. VITAL VT responds by turning local libraries into telehealth hubs, giving residents a familiar, trusted place to connect with health care providers.
For some families this can mean the difference between delaying care and getting timely support. Consider a parent juggling work and three kids, living 45 minutes away from the nearest clinic. A telehealth visit from a local library can mean timely care and fewer missed days of work or school, and provide peace of mind.
It is not just about technology; it’s about meeting people where they are and supporting them in ways that make sense for their lives. 
What makes projects like VITAL VT powerful is the partnership they create between communities, health care providers and students. University of Vermont students gain hands-on experience while helping their neighbors and libraries become central players in local health care efforts.
These efforts also strengthen the regional workforce pipeline: students are exposed to rural practice environments and gain practical experience in community-centered care, while counties benefit from the fresh energy and innovative ideas that student teams bring. This model not only improves access today but encourages the next generation of health care professionals to consider careers in rural Vermont. 
Another example of Vermont’s innovative approach to rural health care is our mobile obstetric simulation program (supported by a UVM health safety and value grant, and a UVM Frymoyer grant). With the recent trend of obstetric units closing in rural areas, more emergency departments are finding themselves on the front line of maternity care, managing labor and delivery scenarios traditionally considered outside their usual scope.
This shift leaves providers with fewer opportunities to practice complex deliveries and neonatal emergencies in a controlled setting. By bringing high-fidelity simulations directly to community emergency departments, clinical teams can rehearse rare but critical scenarios, building confidence and readiness for moments when every second counts.
These trainings have already reached more than 100 health care professionals across the state, helping teams manage emergencies such as preterm births and postpartum hemorrhage. Programs like this demonstrate how Vermont’s health care system can respond creatively to gaps in access while strengthening local teams and improving patient outcomes.
National Rural Health Day doesn’t just remind us that rural health care challenges are part of everyday life here in Vermont, it highlights the new approaches that become possible when communities, providers, and students work together. From telehealth in local libraries, to hands-on obstetric simulations, Vermont’s small towns are full of innovation, collaboration and resilience.
By investing in community-centered programs and supporting local health care infrastructure, we can strengthen health care access for every Vermonter, regardless of geography. Every local initiative, every community partnership, and every effort to connect patients with care is a step toward a rural health care system that works for everyone.

The genuine beauty of dreams
Maelyn Slavik, 15, Burlington
Our world is filled with such
delicate things, such
beautiful little lights we
find glittering in our eyes and
try to tuck
into pages of torn-out notebook paper that we
fold into our pockets and the creases
of our palms.
There’s a boy in my grade who
plays the piano so beautifully, whose
fingers dance across the keys, and
you can tell each careful note flows
with the dreams of his heart and as
a labor of love, one
that flows so smoothly, even though
he probably stumbled at first.
It doesn’t sound like it, though, as
he plays a song, so sweetly, for
a group of girls to dance to, the
sparkling wings of their act fanned out
around their shoulders, slow and
graceful and
absolutely beautiful.
In our show is another boy, an
actor and singer whose accent
makes his words all the prettier, and
who once told us all to thank
one another
for the kindness that lingers
all around us; he
smiles so genuinely, and
you can see his dreams as they shimmer
all around him.
Those dreams (of
the piano and the firefly wings, and
of the boy who carries stars
everywhere he goes)
are ones I’ll fold over and over and
over into tissue paper whose creases
mirror the ones on my palms.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-30 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Could demise of special projects bill make it harder for Speaker White to pass school choice?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/30/speaker-white-special-projects-school-choice/,Legislative leaders often hold the hammer of special projects to get votes for their key proposals like school choice. But what happens if there is no hammer?,"At some point during the quickly approaching 2026 session of the Mississippi Legislature, House Speaker Jason White will meet behind closed doors with his two-thirds Republican supermajority and ask those members to vote for some form of school choice legislation to provide public funds to private schools while requiring little to no accountability and oversight.
It is the modus operandi of White to meet on the public’s business, including expending public funds, behind closed doors before taking pivotal issues to the full House for debate and a final public vote.
But in the 2026 legislative session, which begins in early January, White could be meeting behind closed doors without the hammer he has previously possessed.
The leadership of the Legislature has long held the hammer over members’ political heads of the so-called special projects bill that is routinely one of the last items passed at the end of each session. The bill provides funds – often totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars – to pay for projects back home. 
Members who buck the leadership on key votes run the risk of not having their town’s main street repaved or lights placed on their local baseball field. Such projects are routinely funded via a single line tucked in a bill totaling hundreds of pages where scores of other similar local projects are included. The projects bill is normally closely overseen by House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, who is one of White’s closest allies.
It is normal to see members, with eyes squinting, perusing the massive bill, looking for their project as the legislation is unveiled during the final hours of the session. 
It is important to understand that for many legislators – especially House members – that special project is more important than phasing out one-third of the state revenue stream as they did with a big tax cut in the 2025 session or sending public funds to private schools with no accountability mechanism as is being proposed in 2026.
But the process of passing the tax cut last year might have changed the dynamic. The fight over reducing the revenue stream over time by one-third was so contentious between the House and Senate that the special projects bill did not pass. It got caught up in the battle.
After arguing all session about the tax cut, which eventually passed in a flawed form, the Senate refused to take up a special projects bill. After such a large cut, Senate leaders said the state could not afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on special projects.
So, it is possible, maybe likely, that some House members who opposed the landmark tax cut legislation voted for it, anyway, with the understanding they would get a special project.
They didn’t, though.
Could that occur again in the 2026 session as a result of a heated debate over whether to spend public funds on private schools?
Would the Senate leadership have the gumption to eschew a special projects bill again? After all, senators like special projects, too.
And would rural House members in areas of the state where there are no private schools of any note vote to take public funds that could be going to their local district and send their taxpayers’ money to a private school in some metropolitan area that their students have no way of attending?

A new art house movie theater, Partizanfilm, is set to open in Burlington next week, filling the gap left by the closure of the Roxy Cinema last year.
The cinema, on 230 College St., will open to members on Dec. 3, and to the broader public the following day, with food and screenings of two movies from the 1970s, “The Last Picture Show” and “Kings of the Road.”
The movie theater has two intimate auditoriums — with 31 and 19 seats, respectively — and a lobby with a cafe-bookstore.
“I kind of couldn’t imagine living in a place without a movie theater,” said Brett Yates, president of Partizanfilm and one of the nonprofit’s five board members. 
Yates said the Roxy was the only commercial movie theater in Burlington, and when it closed last year, he was hoping someone would open a new movie theater. Once it became evident that no one would, he decided to step in.
“I talked with some friends and with my wife, and we thought, well, maybe we could be the ones who do something about it,” Yates said. 
So the five Burlingtonians started looking for spaces for sale to create the movie theater and bought the current property last May.

Now, after months of renovation and with the help of volunteers and members, the space is ready for the upcoming opening.
The cinema will be open seven days a week and offer a mix of commercial movies, independent and foreign films, and old movies. Movies in the evening cost $12, with cheaper tickets during the day. Members have a $2.50 discount on any ticket.
Some of the first movies on the schedule include “Angel’s Egg,” “Henry Fonda for President,” and “Eternity,” with later screenings featuring titles such as “Marty Supreme,” starring Timothée Chalamet, and “The Secret Agent,” which won the best director and best actor prizes at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.
“We’re not business people. We’ve never started a nonprofit corporation before,” Yates said. “But I think we’ve been, overall, very fortunate. It has kind of all come together.”

Yates said the board wanted to create a social hub where people could gather and talk about films, not just a movie theater.
His wife, Michelle Sagalchik, who is also a board member, said the plan is for people to get involved in the cooperative project and potentially run to become board members when current board members finish their terms.
“We want Partizanfilm to belong to the community. We want the community to take ownership of it,” Yates said. 
Partizanfilm already has about 390 members, according to Yates.
“We — the founding board — don’t want to run it forever,” he said. “We’re creating a cultural institution that we hope we can pass on to everybody.”

A stray comment from a local dollhouse club has snowballed into nearly every downtown storefront aiming to shrink a challenging economic climate with an inaugural Festival of Miniatures.

BRATTLEBORO — Melany Kahn was hosting a local dollhouse club last spring when she first eyed the 3-foot-tall model Victorian “painted lady” in need of a facelift.
“I didn’t see its warts,” Kahn recalled of torn clapboards and tarnished copper. “I just saw its possibilities.”
As a half-dozen club members repaired and restored the aging micro-manse, a stray comment about displaying it downtown snowballed into something bigger.

“Wouldn’t it be amazing,” Kahn remembered hearing, “if every store had one in its window?’”
Cue the inaugural Festival of Miniatures, set to debut this December with nearly 90 dollhouses, dioramas and toy trains — even a working “Mouse Metro” escalator — on display through a partnership with the Downtown Brattleboro Alliance. 
Local merchants spent much of 2024 battling headlines about business closures, bank consolidations and boosted police presence. Festival organizers, aiming to change the narrative, hope thinking small will pay off big.
“Small is cute and sweet and whimsical and charming — and also accessible and affordable,” Kahn said in an interview. “The idea is not to just stand outside and look, it’s an invitation in.”

That’s why the Shoe Tree now features handknit animals nestled in literal shoebox apartments. Why Morning Glorious Vintage has dolls in retro couture. Why Mitchell Giddings Fine Arts has the newly restored model Victorian filled with 100 locally crafted small-scale furnishings.
“Most artists went above and beyond,” said Kahn, pointing to tiny touches fashioned by area potters, weavers and glassblowers.
The festival, running through December, will officially launch during the town’s first-Friday-of-the-month Gallery Walk. Alongside storefronts, the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center will host toy trains, the Latchis Gallery will feature a “Museum of Things Tiny and Found” and the Boys & Girls Club will offer a Dec. 20 display of “Spirit Houses” decorated by 13 area schools.
Organizers won’t say if the festival will return until they record and review public response.
“There are metrics we can measure,” Kahn said of spectator and sales figures.
There’s also the small stuff not easily seen.
“Shopkeepers are working very, very hard to make our downtown thrive, and that’s what has kept me so invested and involved,” Kahn said. “To me, supporting this feels really good, really important.”
And, amid so many miniatures, really big.

Strong was stringing along at least 10 van customers from seven states, the court documents state. He has agreed to forfeit a total of $477,502 in payments, according to the plea agreement.

This story by John Lippman was first published in Valley News on Nov. 26, 2025.
A Bradford man faces a potential prison sentence and nearly $500,000 in restitution payments for taking payments for van conversions for which he failed to perform the work.
Matthew Strong ran the now-shuttered business called East Coast Van Builds on Route 5 in Bradford’s Lower Plain. He advertised as a specialist in customized camper vans. He also has worked as a music promoter and is known for organizing reggae events in the state.
Strong has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of wire fraud after admitting that he took van customer payments and diverted some of the money to his entertainment business, according to a plea deal entered in federal court in Burlington on Nov. 18.
Strong required customers to pay an initial $10,000 non-refundable down payment and then 50% toward the remaining balance of their job — typically $30,000 or more — but failed to deliver the work as promised and dodged calls and emails from irate customers inquiring about the status of their vehicles, the court documents said.
East Coast Van Builds operated from 2021 through at least the end of 2024 and specialized in converting Ford Transit and Mercedes vans into customized camper vehicles with kitchen, bathroom and bedding facilities, according to court documents.
Customers said Strong would prevaricate when it became apparent the work had not been done, or ghost them altogether, according to court documents and interviews with customers. An attorney listed in court documents as representing Strong did not respond to an email request for comment on Tuesday. An email to an address listed for Strong also received no response.
A private Facebook group called Survivors of East Coast Van Builds, which was created in March as a place for former customers “to commiserate, share resources, legal advice, ideas, rage, and heal,” now has 37 members.
Many of the accounts shared in the group echo that of Charlie Allen.
Allen, a retired software developer from Wilmington, Delaware, said he and his wife had purchased a new Ford Transit 350 HD van for $65,000 in 2022 which was delivered that May to Strong in Bradford to convert into a camper. The cost of the job would be $120,000, and Allen said he paid half upfront.
Then began the runaround, Allen said.
“I’d call him up and ask what’s going on,” Allen, 71, told the Valley News. “He’d say, ‘Oh, I’m having trouble getting parts’, or ‘So-and-so ‘is sick’. Then the summer wore on and it’s August and he says, ‘A month. You’re third in line’. Then there’d be another month.”
Eventually, Allen became fed up with the excuses and said he drove seven hours from his home in Delaware to Bradford in February 2023 — nine months after Strong took possession of the van — to see for himself what the problem was. What Allen said he found was that only the windows, roof vents and a fan had been installed, only a fraction of the work.
“He’d done zip,” said Allen, who abandoned all hope and drove off with his van.
He said he does not expect to recover the $60,000 he paid to Strong despite the restitution required under his plea agreement. He noted that when he and his wife found another company to complete the conversion, the windows that Strong installed had to be replaced because they leaked.
“We got nothing. All we got was lies,” Allen said.
According to court documents, Strong took photographs of work-in-progress inside one customer’s van and sent them to the customer of another van claiming the images were evidence of work-in-progress on the van the second customer had demanded to see.
In another instance, Strong used money customers paid for van conversions to cover expenses for a music festival he produced in Topsham in 2022, prosecutors said. He used one customer’s van without permission at the Topsham festival, which the customer was able to detect through tracking software.
Strong, through his company Rooted Entertainment Solutions, organized the Green Mountain Reggae Festival at the Bradford Fairgrounds last year and the Green Mountain Smoke Out festivals in Topsham in 2023 and 2024.
Strong was stringing along at least 10 van customers from seven states, the court documents state. He has agreed to forfeit a total of $477,502 in payments, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has not yet been scheduled for Strong to formally enter his guilty plea on a single felony count of wire fraud. A conviction on the charge is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.
Even customers who were able to get their van conversions completed by Strong said it was an ordeal. Michelle Robbins said she had to literally show up on the day she was told work would be done and wouldn’t leave until it was completed.
“We were actually one of the ‘lucky’ ones. … We did end up getting a build-out but only after showing up at the shop multiple times demanding answers,” Robbins said via text. “We straight up accused (Strong) of felony fraud because he had $60K of our cash and nothing to show for it,” she said. “At that point we gave a firm deadline … We knew there was no money and knew we had to push for a build rather than try to get money back.”
“We let him know it was up to him whether we got the police involved,” Robbins wrote. “Once we accused him of fraud, he magically found time to work on the van and get it almost complete — with many issues because they rushed.”
Getting his van converted into a van was a much rougher ride for Tim Weaver, however. Weaver, of Carrabassett Valley, Maine, said he forked over $60,000 to have Strong convert a van he purchased at the Lebanon Ford dealership in 2023 and contracted with him in April of that year to begin work.
Weaver had very specific instructions about how the van was to be fitted out with special equipment because his wife, Carol Weaver, is an adaptive athlete who is a paralyzed from the chest down as the result of a mountain biking accident three years ago. The couple’s goal was to have a vehicle that could transport Carol Weaver’s $25,000 mountain bike securely while also providing room for Tim Weaver, also a software engineer, to work remotely.
A specially fitted-out camper van, like the one Tim Weaver had seen on YouTube of a paralyzed former Canadian female Olympic athlete using to “drive around Canada,” would be the ideal solution for them. At first Strong seemed enthusiastic about taking on the van conversion project, even contacting the Canadian woman in the YouTube video.
“That to us said all the right things. We jumped right in,” said Tim Weaver, admitting sheepishly, “we didn’t do a lot of due diligence after that.”
So in April 2023, the Weavers signed a contract and sent Strong the initial $10,000 down payment and soon followed that with another $50,000 for “materials cost” [sic]. They also spent $67,000 to buy a Ford Transit Extended High Roof.
“Less than two weeks after I wired the big $50K (to Strong) it was radio silence,” Weaver said. Months passed before Weaver said he could finally get Strong on the phone again. “I was a little upset,” Weaver said.
He recalled telling Strong, “I get you may not be jumping on my van because you got other things going on, but I send you 50 grand and you ignore me? You just take my money?” Weaver said “that was the point we should have bailed. But we had already invested so there was no way out.”
In April 2024, 12 months after they had signed the contract and paid Strong $60,000 Weaver said he delivered the van to Strong’s shop in Bradford. Inquiries about how things were progressing were fruitless. The few times he could get Strong to respond, “he said they ‘started it, we’re working on it’. There was always some weird excuse, like ‘my dad’s house burned down’,” Weaver said.
Although he demanded photographs as proof of progress, Weaver said none were ever sent.
“The van sat with them from April 2024 until we got a call from the Vermont AG’s office saying, ‘You need to come get your van,’ which was April 2025, basically 12 months,” Weaver said.
He traveled from Maine, and when he got there and tried to start the engine, it wouldn’t turn over. A rear brake light was smashed. The only conversion work that had been done was some mounting strips to which interior paneling was to be attached — but was so poorly done it had to be stripped out. “Basically, after two years, all I had was flooring,” Weaver said.
With the help of jumper cables, Weaver got the van to start and he drove it back to the dealership in Lebanon, which in a couple weeks did the necessary repairs. He then brought it to home Maine where Weaver, now retired and with ample time on his hands, embarked on a DIY project to convert the van into a camper himself.
Weaver wrapped up the project a couple months ago, and on Dec. 5, he and Carol are driving the camper to Breckenridge, Colorado, where Carol will participate in the Hartford Ski Spectacular, a week-long program ski and snowboarding adaptive program.
“That will be our first big trip,” Weaver said.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)  Linda McLain reached the end of her two-year sentence at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in July, but it would be another month before she could leave. It took those 30 extra days for her to find a residential facility that met the terms of her supervised release.  
Her wait time is an indication of the state’s shortage of transitional living space, group homes where the recently incarcerated can ease their way back into society. The supervised settings offer reliable shelter while residents seek employment and meet what are often rigorous terms of release, including drug testing and court appearances.   
McLain, 55, was placed at A New Way of Life, a residential reentry center in New Orleans. She was imprisoned in 2023 for a string of drug and property crimes in Jefferson Parish, describing them as poor decisions attributed to a substance addiction. She was sentenced to a diversion program that kept her isolated from the main prison population to focus on her recovery and job-training skills.

But even with that special treatment and an extra month behind bars, McLain acknowledged she was not ready to be out on her own. 
“If you are protecting us so hard and keeping us from the elements in prison, now who’s going to protect me when I get out?” McLain said in an early September interview. 
As of mid-November, she was still living at A New Way of Life and training for a promotion at the restaurant where she works. 
There’s no precise picture of how many formerly incarcerated people require reentry services in Louisiana. Residential reentry programs are supervised at the district court level, so there is no cumulative number available from state corrections officials on how many people live in such settings. 
Incarceration data sheds some light on the need. Louisiana has consistently led the nation in per capita prison population, with more than 1,000 out of every 100,000 residents imprisoned as of 2024 according to the Prison Policy Initiative.
As of Sept. 30, there were nearly 30,000 people in state custody according to the latest numbers from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Almost 45,000 more are under state supervision, with the large majority on probation.
Instead of running its own halfway houses, the state contracts with nonprofit residential reentry service providers, who operate 36 housing sites in 17 parishes. 










The work we do not only improves the quality of life for our clients, but it's improving public safety for the community.


– Andrew Hundley, The Parole Project co-founder


The Parole Project, a Baton Rouge-based organization, is the largest of these nonprofits. It owns 11 properties for people transitioning from prison to residential supervision and another 33 residences for individuals who’ve completed their obligation to the state but still need its structure and support service. These homes, too, have been at maximum capacity all year. 
“I estimate that we’re only able to accommodate half of the people in prisons who reach out to us, asking us for reentry services and housing support when they leave,” said Andrew Hundley, Parole Project co-founder and executive director. 
Hundley was the first “juvenile lifer” in Louisiana to be paroled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled life sentences without parole for child offenders were unconstitutional. He was imprisoned at age 15 for the second-degree murder of 14-year-old Terri Pitre in Acadia Parish in 1997. Hundley’s sentence was commuted to time served when he was 36, and he helped launch the Parole Project within months of his release. 
Initially, he and the other formerly incarcerated individuals in his organization saw themselves as mentors to others who would be freed under the ruling. They would help them open bank accounts, get their drivers’ licenses and teach them to use cellphones, which didn’t exist when many of them were first sentenced.      
“Where we were off the mark was housing because there’s the assumption that people are going to go home to their families,” Hundley said. “That missed on people who’ve been in prison so long they’ve outlived their families … Sometimes you don’t want to go back to the community where you caused harm because you want a place to start fresh.”
Hundley said there are no plans for the Parole Project to expand beyond its Baton Rouge footprint, though its services are available to anyone regardless of where they’re from in Louisiana if they don’t want to go back home after exiting prison. Housing prices are a primary obstacle to adding transitional living space in New Orleans, Hundley said.

There are also no plans on the horizon for the state to put more money into what its corrections department calls emergency and transitional housing, according to Nicole George, coordinator of the state’s Justice Reinvestment Initiative. 
“We’re always interested in improving as [the Division of Parole and Probation] sees the need for us to reevaluate certain things,” George said. 
When it was started in 2015, Louisiana’s Justice Reinvestment Initiative sought to save money on corrections with a focus on placing violent, serious offenders in prison. The resulting prison population drop allowed those resources to be directed toward reentry and other programs to reduce recidivism.     
Former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, championed the initiative over his two terms in office. His successor, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, has emphasized longer prison sentences for more offenders and fewer opportunities for parole through his first two years in office. His administration has directed significant dollars toward upgrading and building juvenile correctional facilities.    
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The need for transitional living space in New Orleans was evident soon after A New Way of Life cut the ribbon on a two-story house in the Hollygrove neighborhood. It’s been at or near its capacity of 16 residents since first opening its doors in January.
The Los Angeles-based nonprofit has similar sites in 12 states and two African countries for women who have exited prison. Founder Susan Burton came to New Orleans in January for its grand opening. She launched the organization in 1998 after being incarcerated for a total of 20 years for crimes related to her drug addiction.  
Based on Burton’s post-prison experience and needs, A New Way of Life provides much more than shelter. Its staff connects formerly incarcerated women with jobs and logistical assistance to keep them. There’s also mental health support, both formal and informal, including counseling for a number of residents who are recovering from addiction and substance abuse.
“Having places like this benefits all of us,” Jefferson Parish Judge June Berry Darensburg, who oversees its drug court, said in an interview. Defendants who appear before her can be diverted from hard prison time if they are good candidates for in-custody rehabilitation and work skills training. They’re also required to secure a spot in a reentry facility such as A New Way of Life. 
The impact of transitional residential services has caught the attention of state Rep. Debbie Villio, R-Metairie, a former Jefferson Parish prosecutor known for tough-on-crime legislation. She declined an interview but confirmed last month that she’s working with the state corrections department, the Parole Project and other groups on legislation in support of reentry services. 
The state provides up to $20 per day per formerly incarcerated person for six months of transitional housing. This money doesn’t cover the Parole Project’s expenses, Hundley said. He explained the organization doesn’t manage its properties as a money-making operation, with rental rates deliberately kept below market rate for its post-transitional housing to keep those tenants on the path to self-sufficiency. 
Hundley is banking on philanthropy to ensure the Parole Project can continue its mission, noting that any reduction in state funding could force belt-tightening. 
“The work we do not only improves the quality of life for our clients, but it’s improving public safety for the community,” Hundley said.

‘You’re going to have rules’
Structure is part of living at A New Way of Life, a residential home in New Orleans for the formerly incarcerated where the staff ensures residents show up on time for work, court dates, drug screenings, counseling and any other appointments deemed necessary. 
The women who live here are also expected to take part in daily group discussions at 8 a.m.. They’re also responsible for household chores and must adhere to a 10 p.m. curfew.  
“That structure is there to help them understand that everywhere you’re going to go, there’s going to be rules. Even if you’re out on your own and have your own apartment, your own house, you’re going to have rules,” said Dante Butler, the New Orleans home’s director of housing services. “Getting them used to that societal structure is a plus for them, and once they get out there it won’t be such a huge shocker.”
Butler handles most of the residents’ logistics. He’s also an attorney who accompanies some of the women to their court appearances, helping to build a solid reputation for the new reentry home.
Linda McLain is among the 16 residents at the home. She was released from prison in July after serving a two-year sentence for drug and property crimes in Jefferson Parish, where a judge placed her in a diversion program that’s contingent upon her following the rules of A New Way of Life.
Within days of settling in at the group home, McLain started a job on the overnight shift at a nearby 24-hour restaurant. It was the only time slot that didn’t conflict with her daytime court obligations. 
Even with all of the court-ordered and self-imposed restrictions she faces, McLain still keeps an eye toward the future. Her ultimate goal is to start her own business, putting to use the horticultural and pest control certificates she earned while in prison. She wants to employ other formerly incarcerated women who need the same hand up she’s received. 
“I’m 55 years old. I cannot keep going in that same path. Where am I going? Nowhere,” McLain said in an early September interview. “For me, I just want to live the next half of my life successfully.” 
McLain is still coming to terms with how her criminal past led her family to “washing their hands” of her, calling it her lowest moment. She’s not to reunite with those relatives yet.
“They like to remind me that, ‘You know you’re where you’re at because of the mistakes you made,’” McLain said. “I know that I don’t need you constantly reminding me.” 
As of mid-November, McLain was still living at A New Way of Life. Butler said she continues to progress in her recovery and is now being trained in different positions at the restaurant with plans to become a manager.
Trenice Lawson, 50, lived in the group home for six months and found her own place nearby in August that she shares with her son. She was released from prison in 2023 after serving 25 years for attacking a security guard at a hospital while under the influence of drugs. Lawson said it was the culmination of a criminal history driven by her addiction.
“My lifestyle before I went to prison was basically the street life, the drugs, the hustling,” she said. “I shoplifted to support my habit.”
Her first transitional living site after prison didn’t offer the structure Lawson said she needed, and living with her brother in the River Parishes meant she had few opportunities to find work. But after moving into A New Way of Life earlier this year, she landed a full-time job with a tour bus company and picks up shifts with the Superdome event staff during football games. Lawson credits the group home’s nurturing environment with helping her confront trauma from her childhood and begin the healing process.
One of the key components of group home life Lawson and McLain both mentioned is the shared experience and insight of the other women under the same roof,  
“Any given point if, if one of us is having a bad day, we can look at each other and go, ‘What’s going on? Talk to me. Let’s go talk about it,’” McLain said. “And there’s absolutely no judgment going on. We know we’ve been there.

Then James Wayman, a chef who was conducting his own soy experiments, got involved.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things Credit: ct mirror
In 2018, Bob Florence tapped out a message on Instagram. Would James Wayman, then head chef of Mystic’s Oyster Club, try the soy sauce that Florence had been brewing in barrels in his basement? 
Florence didn’t know that Wayman was already conducting his own nascent experiments with koji on the second floor of Oyster Club. Koji, a mold that transforms soybeans into soy sauce and rice into miso, has been a tool in Asian cooking for millennia, but Wayman was just beginning to explore how it might be deployed in his kitchen, from fermenting charcuterie to baking bread. 
“Koji has been the single biggest game changer in the food I’ve made over the years,” said Wayman, sitting at a picnic table on a sunny October day outside of his cafe, Nana’s, in Mystic. When koji is used to inoculate beans and grains, it releases sugar from starch and amino acids from protein. Those flavors — of sweetness and umami — linger on the palate. Together they play a chord of flavor, Wayman says, rather than a single note. 
“Some of the most amazing foods in the world don’t do that. An incredible peach is so amazingly delicious, but you eat it, you have the flavor sensation, and it’s gone, right? Koji has the ability to draw that out and make it bounce around all of your taste buds.”

Koji was also the critical ingredient transforming soy beans into the soy sauce in Florence’s basement in Mystic — a slow-motion Maillard reaction, the same chemical process that occurs when proteins and sugars are heated and rendered delicious. Think: the sear on a steak, or the caramel notes in the crust of a baguette. 
When Florence took on soy sauce making, he was moving on from a long career that combined manufacturing with chemistry. Early in his career, he lived in Detroit and sold industrial plastics to the automotive industry, back when manufacturers were replacing clunky metal parts with plastic to lighten vehicles and improve mileage. Later, Florence worked in electronics manufacturing. Both industries brought him frequently to Japan and China, where he became a disciple of local cuisine. 
Florence eventually used his training as a chemist to pivot from plastics to renewable energy, working with a startup that turned algae into oil. The science worked, but the business wasn’t profitable. By then, Florence was living in Mystic with his wife, children’s book author Debbi Michiko Florence. After selling off the equipment to the algae fermentation company, Florence started casting about for a new idea. He embarked on what seemed, at first, to be a hobby: brewing soy sauce at home. 
“If you go to a grocery store in Japan, there might be a selection of like 20 different soy sauces, whereas in America you might have one or two or three,” Florence said. Often made by small family companies, local Japanese soy sauces, or shoyu, were “beautiful” to Florence. They were thick, opaque, umami-rich, and they enhanced food more deeply than the mass produced translucent varieties on U.S. shelves.
“My question was, how are they made? And can they be made here? And can I make them?” 

Patiently, Florence waited. His koji-inoculated soy beans and wheat turned into soy sauce. He worked up the courage to ask Wayman to try it. Immediately, Wayman asked to put it on the menu at Oyster Club — written into the ingredient list as “Bob Florence Soy Sauce.”

“I was sort of tapping the brakes on being commercial. I was just looking for feedback,” Florence said. “But the next thing I know, he put it on the menu.” 
Wayman could immediately tell that someone who cared about food was making the soy sauce. 
“It was almost like an extension of him, in a way. His food felt like Bob,” Wayman recalled. The soy sauce and the human being who created it both possessed “a quietness, a softness almost, but an intensity and intellect.”

But even after that milestone, Florence continued to tinker. He sought advice from experts, sending a letter to 15 CEOs of Japanese soy sauce companies.  
“My letter to them was really simple. It was, ‘Hi, I’m Bob. I make soy sauce in America, and I’m coming to Japan. Would you mind spending a few minutes talking to me about soy sauce?’” 
Three CEO’s responded. “They were kind and gentle,” Florence said. They let him know his soy sauce was “OK.” Good enough to keep going. Of those CEO’s, Kyosuke Iida, president of Chiba Shoyu, became his mentor. 
Florence, his wife Debbi, and Wayman invested in scaling up the business together, a brand they would call Moromi, which refers to the mash of ingredients put in a barrel to brew what will eventually be pressed and become soy sauce. They searched for a space to expand production and, just before the COVID pandemic hit, found a former batting cage in North Stonington, complete with AstroTurf, and transformed it into a soy sauce brewery. Today, Florence says that Moromi is one of just a handful of U.S.-made soy sauce brands.
Debbi, a third-generation Japanese American, has also written children’s books that play on the theme of cooking, like a picture-book biography of Michelin-starred Chef Niki Nakayama. 
Over the years, Wayman has brought his perspective as a chef to the venture, convincing Florence to experiment. Many of these renditions highlight a single additional ingredient, like maitake mushrooms, sugar kelp, or rye, to create new flavor profiles. Florence would be happy, he says, just making a single version of Moromi, but the experiments have played a part in attracting chefs from across the country to bring Moromi to the tables of their restaurants, to more than 200 shops, and even to Connecticut for visits to the Moromi brewery in North Stonington where they sign their names to the “chef’s wall of culinary creativity.”
Wayman is no longer affiliated with Oyster Club, but at his Nana’s locations in Westerly, R.I., and Mystic, Moromi and koji can be found all over the menu. There are miso glazed sourdough donuts, made to order. Pizza sauce with koji (“it makes a tomato taste more tomatoey,” Wayman says). Koji porridge sourdough bread. Even daily specials like a poke bowl highlight Moromi, with a splash of sugar kelp shoyu. 
“It’s easy, if you know how to cook already, to integrate into your food,” Wayman said.

Even ice cream shop Mystic Drawbridge has gotten in on the fun, crafting their Sweet ‘n Salty Shoyu scoop with a touch of vanilla — cooking Moromi with sugar results in a deep, salty caramel that is at once simple and decadent. 
These days, Florence runs the day-to-day of the business. He gets up early, has a cup of coffee around 4:30 a.m., goes over orders and makes shipments. Perhaps he presses a batch of soy sauce, or inoculates a batch of soy beans which sit in a sauna-like room, paneled with cedar planks. Florence has just one assistant on staff, and though Moromi is carried in stores across the U.S., the operation is small enough that they can handle the volume. Moromi isn’t carried by big box stores, which Florence says is a conscious choice in a business that’s defined by patience. 
“It’s like anti-fast. Everything is slow. The fermentation. The pressing,” he said. “There’s nothing rushed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MOROMI-SOYSAUCE-1001-DE-202-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-30 05:56:11.582771

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)The trouble started one wet Friday morning in late October when Jarom Smith walked past a weathered red gate in a brushy area near the southwest corner of the Emporia city limits. Smith, a citizen journalist, wanted a couple of photos of the old police shooting range inside to post for his readers.
“I simply walked around the gate,” Smith recalls. “I didn’t open anything. I didn’t climb anything. I didn’t have to.”
Smith says he didn’t notice a sign saying the area is for law enforcement only.
We’re standing on the dirt lane outside the open gate, two days before Thanksgiving. As we speak, Smith is being investigated for criminal trespass and authorities have obtained a search warrant for the Facebook account of his digital newspaper, the Lyon County Observer. It seeks “all records” from three days in October.
There are no officers inside practicing, no sharp reports cracking the November air, just a few city workers. They appear to be moving dirt or preparing to. There’s a bulldozer idling on the shoulder of the road behind us. We’re a few hundred yards away from the city transfer station, which before the days of recycling and waste management would be called the city dump.
There’s a “Dead End” sign near the red gate to the shooting range, but the warning sign is behind us and to one side of a low-water bridge maybe 25 yards away. I don’t spot it myself until Smith points a finger at it.
Suddenly the bulldozer comes roaring up behind us and passes close as it goes through the gate. A few minutes later, the transfer station supervisor comes up in a white city truck. The supervisor, a guy named Tim in a dark ball cap and a safety-green shirt, is visibly irritated.
He says the area is posted. I say we’re on public property.
“We’ve already run this guy off twice,” the supervisor says, indicating Smith with a tilt of his head.
Then he steps on the gas and briskly enters the off-limits area.
On Oct. 24, Smith posted the images of the range to the Observer’s Facebook account and then forgot about them. He was surprised when he got a phone call from an investigator with the Emporia Police Department a couple of weeks later saying he was investigating a criminal trespass complaint at the joint city-county shooting range.
“He asked me if I had stepped onto it,” Smith recalls. “I told him I took two photographs and left, and that I didn’t notice any ‘No Trespassing’ sign. He said there was.”
On Nov. 16, he was notified by Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, that the company had received a search warrant for the Observer’s account. When Smith said he didn’t know what the warrant could be about, Meta sent him a copy of the warrant. On its “Information for Law Enforcement” page, the company says it may be compelled, upon receipt of a warrant showing probable cause, to disclose “the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, photos, videos, timeline posts, and location information.” While friends and family chats are now end-to-end encrypted, according to Meta, Smith said he doesn’t believe the same protection applies to business chats.
Signed Nov. 14 by a Lyon County judge, the warrant did not identify the crime being investigated, but it said evidence had been given under oath to find probable cause that an offense had been committed. The warrant sought “all records” for the account from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25.
Meta said Smith had 10 days in which to challenge the warrant or it would release the information. Smith didn’t know what to do. He was afraid he might go to jail through an honest mistake, and he worried about the hundreds of readers who had sent him news tips and other confidential information through the Observer’s account. How could he protect his sources if the police had access to all that information?
It might, Smith feared, be the end of the Observer, a digital upstart on a shoestring budget.
Smith, 41, posts nearly every day. He covers government meetings, publishes crime reports and runs interviews with candidates for local elections. He lives in Olpe, about 14 miles south of Emporia. The Observer has 5,000 followers, and Smith gives them the news with a twist. He’s not afraid to voice his opinion, and that has made him a polarizing figure in this struggling college town of 24,000.
“I really want to see Emporia become a bigger town,” he said, “a stronger town and a more free town. And everything I’m doing is towards that goal.”
Smith defines “more free” as being more transparent, and he believes spending millions on a new shooting range and emergency dispatch center are symptoms of government obfuscation. In one post, he accused a county official of lying about the true cost of the project.
“I don’t think I’m going to stop it from being built,” Smith said, “but it’s time that people speak out and not be afraid.”
It’s a troubling thing for democracy when any news outlet receives a search warrant, and alarming when the warrant is a clear abuse of power. In 2023, the Marion County Record made international news when its newsroom, and the home of its publisher, were targets of a police raid looking for evidence of a nonexistent crime. Authorities improperly seized computers, cellphones, and records. The stress of the raid may have contributed to the death of 98-year-old Joan Meyer, co-owner of the newspaper. The Marion raid, the most brazen example of a challenge to press freedom in recent American memory, has resulted in lawsuits being settled with the paper’s management, its reporters and others in the millions of dollars.
Reporters exercising their First Amendment right to gather news are supposed to be protected by an array of state and federal laws.
“The federal Privacy Protection Act of 1980 sharply limits whether law enforcement can use search warrants against journalists,” David Greene, a senior staff attorney and civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. “The search warrant (in the Lyon County Observer) case would seem to be so overly broad that it would violate the PPA.”
Greene’s foundation is a San Francisco nonprofit devoted to protecting digital privacy, defending free speech, and promoting internet civil liberties. He said he didn’t think the Kansas Reporter’s Shield Law applied in this case, because the warrant sought material from Meta and not the journalist. While subpoenas for information are fairly common, Greene said, search warrants are less so.
“What the Privacy Protection Act is really saying is use a subpoena,” he said.
A subpoena allows a challenge before authorities can seize documents and equipment. There are exceptions, of course, such as when national security is at risk or a person’s life is in danger. It also does not give journalists carte blanche to commit crimes, although it is unlikely that mistakenly setting foot on a prohibited property would be worth more than a warning in most jurisdictions.
Greene pointed out that the act actually doesn’t identify “journalists” in its language but instead defines the protected material as that gathered with the intent to disseminate to the public.
“Everyone who has social media or uses online services (to reach the public) is covered,” Greene said. “So that doesn’t require someone to be a professional journalist.”
Smith said he considers himself a journalist, although many in the community don’t. Reporters from some legacy media outlets will move across the room to be away from him when he covers meetings. Some officials have taken issue with the accuracy of his reporting, and Smith acknowledges that he is still learning but tries to correct any mistakes quickly.
Smith is a largely self-taught journalist. He graduated from Emporia State University with a BA in political science in 2018, but makes his living as a contractor painting homes and businesses. He spends 10 to 15 hours a week gathering news, maintaining the Facebook account and updating the Observer’s dedicated platform called ShareThere. He says the Observer doesn’t yet make any money, and that his income from the contracting business subsidizes the digital publishing venture. He doesn’t have a fancy camera, so he relies on his phone for just about everything, and he often excuses himself to take a call. It’s important, he said, that he answers when the phone buzzes.
Hundreds of people have contacted him through the Observer’s Facebook account with confidential news tips and other information. In the past 90 days alone, he said, after checking his phone, he’s had 141 conversations with readers.
“Sometimes it’s just people saying hey, I like what you wrote,” Smith said. “Sometimes it’s somebody saying, ‘I’ve got a story for you.’ In the past couple of days I’ve had people who want to meet with me. I don’t write about every story that people ask me to, but I guess I’ve become known to cover things that others don’t.”
He files Kansas Open Records Act requests, attends lots of meetings, and asks many questions. Name an entity in Lyon County — the city commission, county officials, the local hospital — and they have likely been stung by Smith’s opinion. Local officials often find him irksome, some told me confidentially, but others said they had a growing respect for his plainspoken tenacity. His pieces aren’t as polished as those of veteran reporters, but he is building a dedicated audience through aggressive reporting and sharp point of view.
“Emporia’s economy has taken hit after hit — Tyson gone, Holiday Resort closed, Morgan Advanced Materials shuttered — yet the Regional Development Association continues drifting without leadership, purpose, or result,” he wrote in one recent post.
In another:
“On Tuesday, three new (city) commissioners were elected, backed by the same circle of old-money power brokers that have steered this town for decades.”
And, back in April 2025, this commentary about the county’s purchase of land to build a new law enforcement shooting range and 911 communications center at a cost of $2 million:
“For what purpose was this tract of land bought?” Smith asked. “A shooting range. Not a public one for you and me, but for the sheriff’s department. Never mind the fact that they already have one about 300 yards away from the new site. Never mind the fact that there is an additional one a few miles north of town off of the turnpike.”
The price of the project, according to local reports, has now risen to more than $5 million. At least $1 million — including a $250,000 federal grant — has already been approved for the gun range. I emailed Lyon County Commission Chair Ken Duft for comment on the project and Smith’s criticism. Duft did not respond to the request.
While I seldom agree with Smith because our politics are so different — until recently he called the Observer the Lyon County Conservative — I find him an easy man to talk to, somebody who appears sincere in his beliefs. When he sits for an interview, he is freshly showered and wearing clean clothes but still has paint — a dark, institutional brown — from the day’s contracting job clinging to his hands.
When some readers complained that he called out others for misbehavior but was ignoring his own past, he posted his own mugshot from years ago, when he was booked for a misdemeanor. Smith said the offense was later expunged. In 2020 and 2024, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for county commissioner, coming in third both times.
Like others with connections to legacy media, I was irritated at how Smith began his digital newspaper. It’s not the way I would have done it, I tsk-tsked to myself. But now I realize that is the point of the Observer, because it’s a publication made not for me but for a different audience. It’s an alternative. And anybody who says he’s not gaining needed journalism skills isn’t paying attention.
But the quality of Smith’s reporting is not a factor when it comes to the search warrant. What does matter is the chilling effect on free speech that occurs when investigators seek warrants to access the social media accounts of those who inform the public.
That Smith was the target of a search warrant from officials who should have known better, especially since the Marion raid, is inexcusable. A literal misstep should not be subject to the full force of investigative discovery. What did investigators hope to gain from the Observer’s social media account? Smith had already shared with them the photos he took and admitted to straying into an area where he didn’t have permission. And the county prosecutor, according to Smith, said she hadn’t even seen the search warrant until it was posted on the Observer’s Facebook account.
Since Nov. 25, Smith has been represented by Max Kautsch, a Lawrence attorney specializing in media law who has also contributed columns to Kansas Reflector. Kautsch declined comment. Smith, however, told me a second, narrower search warrant was in the works for the Observer’s account.
I contacted the county prosecutor, Amy Aranda, and asked her about the case. What crime was being investigated? What local code or state statute did investigators suspect of being broken? What did the second search warrant hope to uncover?
“I cannot comment on an ongoing criminal investigation,” Aranda told me in an email, “except to state it is my understanding that a search warrant was withdrawn, no records were produced, and a second search warrant will not be served relating to the matter you’re inquiring about.”
When I described the email to Greene, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyer, he chuckled.
“Well good for them,” he said. “They did the right thing.”

If you’re one of the 82 million Americans who traveled at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, perhaps some of you opted for Amtrak instead of driving. Our nation’s passenger railroad estimates a 6% boost in ridership this year, as Amtrak’s growth and popularity continues.


Not that taking the train is cheap: A one-way, last-minute fare from Stamford to Washington, D.C. on Thanksgiving day was as much as $400 on one train! It’s a matter of demand exceeding supply. Still, Amtrak is proud of these fares which, nationwide have seen the railroad increase overall revenues by 10%.
Aside from worsening highway traffic and delays, why chose the train instead of driving? Because the investment in its infrastructure is finally paying off with better service.
Stations are being improved, crucial bridges (like the Walk Bridge in South Norwalk) are being reconstructed, new tunnels are being built, tracks and overhead power lines replaced. You can see the improvements as you travel.
And then there’s the new equipment.
Amtrak’s long expected (and four years delayed) NextGen Acela is turning eyes as it whooshes up and down the corridor. It’s a really sweet train, with only five sets in service so far but with 23 more sets to come by 2027. But these sleek new trains are having problems, especially between New Haven and Providence, one of the ‘curviest’ parts of the Northeast.
Fast trains abhor curves. While the new Acela can go as fast as 160 mph, it can do so only on about 40 super-straight miles of its 450-mile journey from Washington to Boston. In the rest of Connecticut it can go no faster than Metro-North.
In fact, the new Acela is slower than the old Acela, especially from New Haven to Providence. The reason? Tilting, or lack thereof.
To handle all the curves in Connecticut, Acela is designed to automatically tilt into the curves, maintaining speed without having passengers’ beverages sliding off their tray-tables into their laps.
But because the NextGen Acela is still awaiting final certification by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), it’s limited in how much it can tilt into curves. That means that, between Providence and New Haven, the new Acela takes ten minutes longer than the older models, worsening those supposedly-faster trains’ on-time performance.
Because our tracks in Connecticut are older and placed closer to together than in other parts of the corridor, the tight clearances between passing trains could cause a problem… especially if two passing trains should both be tilting in the wrong direction and sideswipe each other.
As the NextGen Acelas prove their reliability and improvements are made to our tracks, it’s expected that the Federal Railroad Administration will lift some restrictions and all the new trains will ultimately operate at maximum efficiency.
With more and faster trains, the increase in available seats may lead to lower fares. But what Amtrak really needs is competition… the topic for another story.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NexGen-Acela-3-AMTRAK.jpg,,,2025-11-30 04:56:39.813851

Sarah Beckstrom, who had graduated from the school just two years prior.
“Sarah was the kind of student teachers hoped for,” said Webster County High School Principal Gabriel Markle, who taught Beckstrom when she was a student. “She carried herself with quiet strength, a contagious smile and a positive energy that lifted people around her.” 
Beckstrom, 20, died on Nov. 27 after a targeted attack in Washington, D.C., where she was serving with the National Guard. 
“Her commitment to service, both in our school and in our nation’s military, spoke volumes about her character,” Markle said.

Webster Springs is a small town, and dozens of people in attendance Saturday evening knew Beckstrom or her family members. 
They described Beckstrom as a peacekeeper, someone who was quick to help and who often stepped up to serve. She had dreams of becoming an FBI agent, prompting her to join the National Guard. She was part of a Military Police company.
“It’s a terrible thing that happened, but I’m glad that she was the person that’s in the spotlight and is representing not only West Virginia, but our county,” said Amy Jones, 25, who knows Beckstrom’s family. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey attended the candlelight vigil, telling the crowd that justice would be served in Beckstrom’s death. 
“She loved her state, she loved her country, and she wanted to serve,” the governor said. “It’s hard to sit here and not be angry at what happened to Sarah.”
The suspected gunman, 29-year-old Afghan refugee Rahmanullah Lakanwal, will face a first-degree murder charge along with other charges after shooting two National Guard members, including Beckstrom.
The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Wolfe is also from West Virginia.

The Webster Springs community held three vigils for Beckstrom following her death.
“The loss of Sarah Beckstrom in such a tragic and senseless manner has been devastating for all that knew her and loved her,” said Sen. Robbie Morris, R-Randolph. “The grief is palpable everywhere you go. The vigils have been filled with tears and broken hearts. My prayers continue to go out to her family, friends and fellow Guardsmen.”
On Saturday evening, the crowd prayed and sang the hymn, “Amazing Grace,” before lighting candles. Many in attendance wore blue ribbons to honor Beckstrom; wreaths in the same shade of blue hung around town in the miles winding to the high school. 
The high school’s Junior ROTC members presented the colors. 
“I feel like it was a worthy homage to her, and it’s good knowing that you know we have the resolve to get through this as West Virginians, as a whole state, rather than a single county,” said Junior ROTC member Liam Versmessen, 17, who attended high school with Beckstrom. 
Funeral details for Beckstrom haven’t been released. 
Morrisey said that Wolfe and Beckstrom were friends while serving in the Guard. The pair were patrolling near a Metro station blocks from the White House at the time of the shooting.
“We pray to lift up Andrew, who is continuing to fight,” Morrisey said. 
Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration for “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.”
About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
In the wake of the attack on the National Guard members, President Donald Trump announced he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” though he didn’t specify which countries would be included.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska state agencies are partnering with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to help connect Tyson Foods workers and their families with support as 3,200 people lose their jobs with the closure of the town’s longtime beef plant.
On Wednesday and Thursday, a state and local “rapid response layoff services” event is scheduled for Tyson workers at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, according to a statement Saturday from Gov. Jim Pillen’s office.
Representatives of the Nebraska Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Economic Development and Agriculture will offer information about available resources, including unemployment insurance benefits, job search help and economic support programs, the statement said.
Tyson is to convey timing for the event to workers.
“This holiday season will look different for these families, but we know that Nebraskans show up for each other,” Pillen said. “We are seeing that happen in Lexington.”
State hunts way forward after Nebraska got ‘butts kicked’ by Tyson plant closure

Tyson on Nov. 21 announced it is closing the longtime Lexington beef plant, eliminating jobs around Jan. 20. The company also is laying off about 1,700 workers at its plant in Amarillo, Texas.
Tyson’s announcement of the closures did not specifically address why it targeted the Lexington plant over other facilities. A recent earnings report indicated the processing giant stands to lose $600 million in its beef business next fiscal year, on top of the already-incurred $720 million loss over the last two years.
Pillen has said a factor was the age and efficiency of the plant, which originally was constructed around 1973 to manufacture combines and other farm machinery. It was converted and opened as a meatpacking facility in 1990.
State labor officials said workers should file an unemployment claim when their employment ends, not before. Individuals who quit their jobs due to an upcoming layoff are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits, the statement said. The state Department of Labor says it will provide reemployment services to impacted workers. Inquiries can be emailed to ndol.rapidresponse@nebraska.gov.
State Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said Nebraska employers also are coming together for job fairs. Details are to be announced soon.

In addition to state agency efforts, the Lexington Community Foundation is distributing information about local organizations providing and accepting assistance to support workers. People can visit givebiglexington.org for more information.
Pillen has said he did not learn of the Tyson decision until around noon on Nov. 21, the afternoon Tyson released a public statement on the closure. The governor told the Examiner that the “good news” is that Tyson officials are exploring other options for the Lexington plant property, including repurposing it into a specialty, “value-added” agricultural operation.
Tyson did not respond to a reporter seeking comment on that possibility. 
“This is a difficult time for the community and the impacted workers, but they have truly come together to help make DOL’s efforts possible,” Thurber said in the Saturday statement about the outreach session. “An event of this size would not be happening this quickly without community support.”

Here are instructions on how to look up your new Property Tax Bill on the New Castle County website.
New property tax bills are being sent to all New Castle County property owners this week.  If you haven’t received yours – or wish to dig a little deeper and understand the changes that have occurred for your – here are instructions to into your record on the New Castle County website.  This is best accomplished using a desktop, laptop or tablet computer.  It is possible to do on a smart phone, but requires a bit of finesse with the smaller screen.  For the easiest experience, you could print out this article and have it for reference, as you navigate to your information.
First, go to the New Castle County “Parcel Search” screen.  Use this link or use your browser search engine to navigate there (enter “New Castle County Parcel Search”).
https://www3.newcastlede.gov/parcel/search/
Once on the screen, below, it is usually easiest and most successful to enter the absolute minimum information.  I recommend “Street Number”, “Street Name” (use “contains” and the primary word, no direction), and the “City” (Wilmington, Newark, Middletown, etc…).  Select “Search.”
 
Step one. Enter your address.
 
The screen should display your record and, perhaps, others that fit the broad search terms your entered.  Simply click on the line for your property.  That will take you to the detailed screen for your property.  Once there, you will see the property description and your current assessed value.  This value has been updated by the reassessment process and reflects your property value as of July 2024, which is the basis for your taxes.  This screen also shows any building and plumbing permits, historically, District & Zoning information (identifying your various state and county representatives and zoning information).  It also shows the “Deed History” for this property.
Step 2. Confirm that this is your home… click on View Tax and Sewer Bills
 
Select “View Tax and Sewer Bills” to see your current (and a dozen or so prior) tax and sewer bills.  Your current Tax Bill should be dated about 11/17/25.  For comparison, you can view last year’s bill, dated about 7/23/24.  There is also the preliminary bill that was issued in July of 2025, before actions were taken to readjust that tax rates for residential versus commercial property owners.  The 11/17/25 bill should be identical to the bill you will receive in the mail, shortly.
Additional details on your property are visible by selecting “Property Characteristics” on this menu.
Step 3… click on Property Characteristics
Your 2025 Property Tax is due by December 31st.  If you have a mortgage and your taxes are paid through escrow, your lender should handle payment.  If your escrow is insufficient to cover a possible increase, they may notify you of the need to make a supplemental contribution to your escrow account and your future mortgage escrow payments may be adjusted for next year.  Contact your lender with questions or concerns about this.  If you do not have a mortgage or pay your property tax separately, then the payment must reach New Castle County before the end of the year to avoid penalties.
Lastly, be aware that some formal appeals are still in process.  If you did not appeal your 2025 property tax bill, you can still seek changes for 2026.  However, the deadline for 2026 appeals to be filed is March, 14, 2026.  If you are a “Senior” (either owner is over 65 years old), there is currently a “Senior School Tax Credit” of $500, but it must be filed by April 30, 2026, if you have not previously filed for this relief.  There is no income restriction on this particular credit, only age is required to qualify.  You only file once for the Senior School Tax Credit, then it continues automatically.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-29-141411.jpg,,,2025-11-29 14:57:47.885935

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/SD Searchlight)South Dakota’s wetlands aren’t just pretty places on a map; they’re our lifeline, filtering drinking water, keeping rivers clean, and soaking up floods before they reach our basements.
But here’s the deal: The EPA just finalized a rule proposal that slashes federal protections for these vital lands, especially those without a “continuous surface connection” to rivers and streams. This rollback isn’t theoretical. It’s real, and it’s happening right now. If we let these rules fade away, we’re risking more than a patch of grass. We’re putting our water, wildlife and future growth on the line.


Comment period open
On Nov. 20, the proposed rule “Updated Definition of ‘Waters of the United States'” published in the Federal Register, triggering a 45-day comment period will that will close on Jan. 5.
Comment portal >


Think about the last heavy rain that flooded our fields or sent muddy water racing through our streets. Without wetlands acting as nature’s sponge, those floods hit harder. This new EPA rule invites more tile drainage and agricultural expansion, meaning less water gets filtered and more pollution goes straight into our streams and lakes, risking algal blooms and drinking water problems.
But the story isn’t just about water. South Dakota’s wetlands are bustling habitats for waterfowl, deer, and the wild things that make our prairie special. Hunters, anglers and birdwatchers feed local businesses and bring millions into our state. Strip away those habitats, and rural economies take a hit. The EPA’s recent move exposes nearly 2 million acres of South Dakota’s wetlands to new risks, and with no strong state-level protection, we could lose even more.
Some say wetland regulations hold us back, but in the long term, that’s just not true. Wetlands save us money on water treatment, protect property values, and attract outdoor recreation and tourism. Communities with strong wetland protections bounce back faster from disasters and keep dollars flowing long after a storm rolls through.
Letting wetland protections vanish under the new EPA rule is a short-sighted bet South Dakota can’t afford. If we want strong towns, thriving farms, and a future for our kids to hunt, fish and enjoy clean water, we need to defend what’s left of our natural infrastructure. This isn’t about red tape, it’s about resilience. Our wetlands make South Dakota stronger. When they lose, we lose.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-29 17:33:10+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,How a 1940 electoral system reform in Cambridge made its 2025 housing breakthrough possible,Andrew Justus and Alex Armlovich,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/how-a-1940-electoral-system-reform-in-cambridge-made-its-2025-housing-breakthrough-possible/,This is more than just a housing “win.” It’s a triumph for Cambridge’s unique brand of representative democracy—one that balances citywide priorities with fair representation for diverse communities.,"Last winter, Cambridge quietly accomplished what few cities have dared: through an ambitious zoning reform, it legalized four-story buildings across nearly every neighborhood. The reform is projected to increase the city’s capacity for new homes. 
This is more than just a housing “win.” It’s a triumph for Cambridge’s unique brand of representative democracy—one that balances citywide priorities with fair representation for diverse communities. 
Why did Cambridge succeed where other cities have failed? The answer lies not just in zoning, but in how Cambridge elects its city council.  
When cities shift from all at-large councils to district-based council seats, housing construction falls by 21 percent. This is because district- or ward-based council members are strongly motivated to block new development in their neighborhoods. When every member follows that instinct, the city builds less housing. 
Traditional electoral systems with all at-large seats can so thoroughly suppress minority representation that they violate the Voting Rights Act. Cities then face a dilemma: Either prioritize citywide interests like housing, or ensure fair representation for localized minority groups. Faced with this tradeoff, many housing advocates have steered clear of debates over electoral design altogether. 
Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem, first elected in 2021, campaigned – and won –on a citywide pro-housing platform. When we spoke to Azeem, he said, “In a district-based system, there may not be enough renters in any one district to elect a council member.” In our conversation, he added, “But in an at-large system, renters from across the city can vote for candidates that reflect their priorities.” 
This victory was not accidental, but the product of a skilled political entrepreneur and a growing pro-housing movement, empowered by an electoral system that resolves the tradeoff between citywide needs and minority representation. 
In a city with district-based representation, the political costs and benefits of development are fundamentally misaligned. The backlash to a new apartment building can be concentrated in a local council member’s district. The benefits are often spread across the entire city or region. 
This imbalance creates a legislative norm of deference to the local council member on land-use matters. While the phenomenon has different names in different cities, the outcome is the same: homebuilding stops. 
As then-Mayor Ed Koch warned when New York City adopted this model in 1989, it is a recipe for “land use paralysis.” In such systems, only a powerful, independently elected strong mayor can consistently champion citywide interests against the council’s localized concerns.  
But Cambridge has a city council-city manager form of government, which vests some of the executive power of a strong mayor system with the council, making the council’s electoral system crucial for enabling citywide coalitions.  
Since 1940, Cambridge has elected its city council through an at-large ranked-choice system. Candidates win by reaching a vote threshold—just over 10 percent of ballots—ensuring that any political or demographic group with modest support can earn a seat. 
That guarantee of minority representation without resorting to geographic wards is what allows Cambridge to pursue citywide goals like housing. 
The system does not eliminate geography as a basis for representation—it prevents it from being the sole basis. If voters in a neighborhood want to organize as a bloc, they can band together to elect a representative of their choosing. 
Cambridge’s electoral system doesn’t guarantee pro-housing outcomes. As public opinion shifts, it allows a new consensus to gain power proportionally.  
According to Azeem, the system acts as an “accelerator for enacting the voters’ preferences.” In a traditional winner-take-all system, the pro-housing movement would remain shut out of power until it could command a plurality. In Cambridge, it gained a foothold on the council as soon as support crossed the 10 percent threshold. 
Housing advocates on the city council methodically built a coalition to remove barriers to housing. Their first goal was to eliminate parking minimums – an ambitious first choice and proof of concept for the pro-housing coalition. The coalition then moved to reform affordable housing requirements, making it easier to get units built without onerous affordability requirements. Only after crossing these two hurdles did the pro-housing coalition attempt a broader rezoning of the city. 
As Massachusetts communities grapple with state housing mandates and the legacy of local control, Cambridge offers a powerful lesson: good governance design can make reform politically possible. With an electoral system that balances majority rule and minority rights, cities can build coalitions that deliver both representation and results. 
They can – and should – have both.

When the olive green charter bus pulled into the suburban civic center in a conservative area east of Cincinnati just after 9 p.m. on Friday, the women were ready.
They loaded duffels and coolers and bags of snacks into the bus. They carried handmade “Impeach, Convict, Remove” signs, transgender pride flags, and the red hooded cloaks and white bonnets made famous by “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the dystopian feminist novel adapted into a popular Hulu series.
Cincinnati was the first of three stops in a “turn and burn” trip from Ohio to the nation’s capital for a “Remove the Regime” protest — and it didn’t follow the most logical route. Stops in suburbs outside Columbus and Cleveland added hours to the drive. The women didn’t seem to care.
The passengers piled into the dark bus — a dozen or so in Cincinnati, 14 near Columbus, 20 on the outskirts of Cleveland. Some of the women brought along friends, a few came with their spouses and others traveled on their own. There were brief introductions among seatmates as each new group boarded and everyone settled in; a couple of them built blanket tents to block the cold air that seeped in and the lights from cars passing the bus on the highway.
They would need all the rest they could get. This protest trip would involve two overnight bus trips in 36 hours and just 12 hours on the ground.

For people like Judy Routhier, who boarded in Cleveland, the trip to Washington was the latest in a string of public efforts to oppose the Trump administration. This mother of four married to a military veteran said it was her 72nd protest since February. She brought laminated signs that read, “Hump-y Trump-y Must Fall! He’s on the Epstein List” and “This ‘Piggy’ Won’t be Quiet! IMPEACH. CONVICT. REMOVE.”
Deann Ragsdale, who boarded in Cincinnati, was embarking on her first public action despite her opposition to just about every facet of Republican Donald Trump’s presidency from its start. The longtime labor-and-delivery nurse and mother of three teenagers — one of them transgender — keeps a grueling hospital schedule. The protest happened to fall on a weekend off. “Something has to change, and we have to start somewhere,” she said.
Like at many events opposing Trump and his administration, the majority of the bus passengers were women, though a couple who spoke to The 19th noted that men are increasingly joining them in their local protest efforts. The women said they were spurred into action by the administration’s moves to restrict reproductive rights, its attacks on the rights of LGBTQ+ people, its hostility to immigrants and its disregard for the rule of law.
The “Remove the Regime” event was organized by member organizations of the Removal Coalition, a grassroots effort just like the Ohio bus trip. The trip had come together just days earlier, when a woman from Florida raised more than $30,000 through crowdfunding to “find affordable buses and coordinate seats so that no one is left behind just because they can’t pay for a ticket.” Someone else created a “Get to DC” page on Facebook to connect travelers. There were also local events in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fairmont, West Virginia, for those who could not make it to Washington.

When the bus pulled into Union Station, near the Capitol building, just before 9 a.m. on Saturday, Jen Mazzuckelli, who acted as point person for the Cincinnati group, changed into her Handmaid cloak and headed to the Lincoln Memorial. Like many on the bus and at the larger protest, Mazzuckelli is involved with a grassroots political movement known as 50501 — as in 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
“If somebody says ‘50501,’ you know they’re in the fight, you know they’re in the resistance,”  Mazzuckelli, 52, said. “I feel like we’re in Star Wars.”
Mazzuckelli, a mother of three who extracted herself from an abusive marriage, knows on a personal level how looming Republican cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid health insurance and SNAP nutrition assistance might impact her exurban Ohio community. After her divorce, she said she relied on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which provided cash assistance for necessities until she started receiving child support. She currently receives disability benefits due to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She spends more and more of her time protesting the Trump administration and is weighing another run for office after an unsuccessful bid last year for her county’s GOP-dominated board of commissioners. For now, she tries to be a thorn in their side, showing up to meetings.
As Mazzuckelli and other women dressed like Handmaids sat on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial alongside a massive copy of the U.S. Constitution, she thought to herself: “This will probably end up in history books, if we have real history books … It’s a historical moment, and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it instead of watching it on TV.”
“Remove the Regime” was a three-day action that included lobbying, trainings, an event honoring the military and its veterans, then the rally and a march. There were music performances from the Dropkick Murphys, among others, and a sold-out “Comedy Church” fundraiser with a set from North Carolina’s Cliff Cash, who is known for humor skewering Southern conservatism. Cash was one of the first to join the Removal Coalition, founded by Jessica Denson, a former staffer on Trump’s 2016 campaign who brought a class-action lawsuit over its use of nondisclosure agreements. Rep. Al Green, a Texas progressive, spoke at the rally, as did House of Representatives contender Kat Abughazaleh from Illinois.
The protest events came after a particularly tumultuous week for Trump that highlighted his past treatment of and continued hostile rhetoric directed at women. After months of delay tactics on behalf of GOP leaders, Congress voted on Tuesday to compel the Justice Department to release its files on disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump snapped, “Quiet! Quiet, piggy,” at a female Bloomberg News reporter who asked about releasing the Epstein files aboard Air Force One. But then he reversed course, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: “I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”
Epstein references abounded on signs at the rally; Routhier, who was also wearing a fuzzy pig hat, was one of hundreds who had worked Trump’s exchange with the reporter into their protest gear. A woman from Northern Virginia carried a “Quiet, Piggy, lil’ fascist piggy” sign. A woman in a Trump mask with pig ears and a snout held a sign that urged “IMPEACH the Piggy!!” as she stood next to her Air Force veteran husband. At least a half dozen protesters were dressed up as Miss Piggy from The Muppet Show.
It wasn’t the largest event opposing Trump, but it was meaningful for those in attendance.
Amber Curry, a 36-year-old from Georgia, said the president’s treatment of women was a big factor in drawing her to Washington for her first-ever protest. Her husband is a disabled veteran and her family of six relies on programs like SNAP — which disproportionately serves women, children and older and disabled Americans — to feed themselves and make ends meet. Their benefits, disrupted during the record-breaking government shutdown that ended earlier this month, still aren’t back to normal. Curry warned that she might cry when talking about her reasons for attending the protest. “It’s so beautiful, people here are listening, because no one around me listens,” she said.
After the speakers and musical performances wrapped, the Miss Piggies and the inflatable eagles, polar bears, frogs, sharks, foxes and at least one Cookie Monster lined up behind the Handmaids and began to march. When Marine Force One flew directly overhead as Trump returned to the White House from an aerial tour with Jack Nicklaus of a planned golf course near Joint Base Andrews, fists and middle fingers rose into the air.
At the end of the day, the women from Ohio made their way back to Union Station, convening in the basement food court to wait for the bus. They rolled up their signs ahead of the journey back to America’s Heartland. There was a buzz of excitement as they shared their experiences.
Erin Nezi, 45, said she was initially drawn to protest the Trump administration because she “felt a camaraderie with all of these women,” referring to the Handmaids, who had by then changed out of their cloaks. Nezi’s first local protest was in February; in recent weeks, she’d begun making trips to the nation’s capital. She is part of a group of women trying to build a Handmaid “army” in rural and exurban southern Ohio.
Nezi is currently unemployed after spending years on an assembly line building steering wheels for Ford vehicles. Her husband is a fully disabled Navy veteran dependent on benefits from Veterans Affairs. She said she is protesting for him — and also for other women like her, for her LGBTQ+ family members, for immigrants in her community and for her 69-year-old mother, who relies on subsidized housing. A constant question that runs through her mind, she said, is, “When is it going to come for me?”
The women boarded just after 9 p.m. The bus made its way out of Washington, crossed Maryland and Pennsylvania, and then stopped in Cleveland, Columbus and finally Cincinnati as the sun rose over the horizon. They thanked the bus driver, also a woman. She thanked them for going to the protest.
Routhier said her 73rd protest is already planned.
Ragsdale is considering making a video to share about how she assembled her sturdy, reusable sign.
Mazzuckelli wants to pursue “deep organizing” in rural, conservative pockets of Ohio, perhaps in conjunction with the Working Families Party.
“My idea is to get a committed group here in Clermont [County] and start pushing eastward,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trumpfeb242025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-29 10:57:22.598691

Kentucky is in the midst of its largest spike in whooping cough since 2012. The disease has killed three babies in Kentucky over the last 12 months. None of the infants or their mothers had been vaccinated against it, the Kentucky Department of Public Health confirmed.
Like measles, which is also spreading at unprecedented levels, whooping cough, more formally known as pertussis, can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine. But with anti-vaccine sentiment increasing and cuts to immunization services, vaccination rates for whooping cough over the past two years have declined in children.
The Conversation asked epidemiologist Annette Regan to explain why pertussis has become so prevalent and how families can protect themselves from the disease.
 What is pertussis and why is it dangerous?

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Researchers in France first identified the B. pertussis bacterium in 1906. The first recorded epidemic of pertussis is thought to have occurred in Paris in 1578.
Infection can cause an acute respiratory illness characterized by severe and spasmodic coughing spells. The classic symptom of pertussis is a “whoop” sound caused by someone trying to breath during a bad cough. Severe complications of pertussis include slowed or stopped breathing, pneumonia and seizures. The disease is most severe in young babies, although severe cases and deaths can also occur in older children and adults.
Some doctors call pertussis “the 100-day cough” because symptoms can linger for weeks or even months.
The World Health Organization estimates that 24.1 million pertussis cases and 160,700 deaths occur worldwide in children under 5 each year. Pertussis is highly contagious. Upon exposure, 80% of people who have not been previously exposed to the bacterium or vaccinated against the disease will develop an infection.
Fortunately, the disease is largely preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, which was first licensed in the U.S. in 1914.
 How do cases last year and this year compare with past years?

During the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022, pertussis cases were lower than usual. This may have been a result of limited social contact due to social distancing, masking, school closures and lockdown measures, which reduced the spread of disease overall.
In the past two years, however, pertussis cases have surpassed figures from before the pandemic. In 2024, local and state public health agencies reported 35,435 pertussis cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a rate five times higher than the 7,063 cases reported in 2023 and nearly double the 18,617 cases reported in 2019 prior to the pandemic.
Between October 2024 and April 2025, at least four people in the U.S. have died of pertussis: two infants, one school-age child and one adult.
 Why are pertussis cases rising?

Although vaccines have resulted in a dramatic decline in pertussis infections in the U.S., incidence of the disease has been rising since the 1990s, except for a brief dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before the start of routine childhood vaccination for pertussis in 1947, its rates hovered between 100,000 and 200,000 cases per year. With vaccines, rates plunged under 50,000 annually by the late 1950s and under 10,000 per year in the late 1960s. They reached a low of 1,010 cases in 1976.
Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, however, the U.S. and several other countries have been seeing a steady resurgence of pertussis cases, which have exceeded 10,000 cases in the U.S. every year from 2003 to 2019. They dropped again during the pandemic until last year’s resurgence.
There is no single explanation for why cases have been rising recently, but several factors probably contribute. First, pertussis naturally occurs in cyclic epidemics, peaking every two to five years. It is possible that the U.S. is headed into one of these peaks after a period of low activity between 2020 and 2022. However, some scientists have noted that the increase in cases is larger than what would be expected during a usual peak.

Some scientists have noted that this apparent resurgence correlates with a change in the type of vaccine used in children. Until the 1990s, the pertussis vaccine contained whole, killed B. pertussis bacteria cells. Whole-cell vaccine can stimulate a long-lasting immune response, but it is also more likely to cause fever and other vaccine reactions in children.
In the 1990s, national vaccine programs began to transition to a vaccine that contains purified components of the bacterial cell but not the whole cell. Some scientists now believe that although this partial-cell vaccine is less likely to cause high fevers in children, it provides protection for a shorter time. Immunity after whole-cell vaccination is thought to last 10-12 years compared with three to five years after the partial-cell vaccine. This means people may become susceptible to infection more quickly after vaccination.
Vaccination rates are also not as high as they should be and have started falling in children since 2020. In the U.S., the percent of kindergartners who are up to date with recommended pertussis vaccines has declined from 95% during the 2019-20 school year to 92% in the 2023-24 school year. Even fewer adolescents receive a booster dose.
 How can people protect themselves and their families

Routine vaccination for children starting in infancy followed by booster doses in adolescents and adults can help keep immunity high.
Public health experts recommend that children receive five doses of the pertussis vaccine. According to the recommendations, they should receive the first three doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, then two additional doses at 15 months and 4 years of age, with the aim of providing protection through early adolescence.
Infants younger than 6 weeks are not old enough to get a pertussis vaccine but are at the greatest risk of severe illness from pertussis. Vaccination during pregnancy can offer protection from birth due to antibodies that pass from the mother to the developing fetus. Many countries, including the U.S., now recommend that women receive one dose of pertussis vaccine between the 27th and 36th week of every pregnancy to protect their babies.
To maintain protection against pertussis after childhood, a booster dose of pertussis vaccine is recommended for adolescents at 11 to 12 years of age. The CDC recommends that all adults receive at least one booster dose.

Because immunity declines over time, people who are in contact with infants and other high-risk groups, such as caregivers, parents and grandparents, may benefit from additional booster doses. When feasible, the CDC also recommends a booster dose for adults 65 years and older.
Vaccine safety studies over the past 80 years have proven the pertussis vaccine to be safe. Around 20% to 40% of vaccinated infants experience local reactions, such as pain, redness and swelling at the vaccination site, and 3% to 5% of vaccinated infants experience a low-grade fever. More severe reactions are much less common and occur in fewer than 1% of vaccinated infants.
The vaccine is also highly effective: For the first year after receiving all five doses of the pertussis vaccine, 98% of children are protected from pertussis. Five years after the fifth dose, 65% of vaccinated children remain protected.
Booster vaccination during adolescence protects 74% of teens against pertussis, and booster vaccination during pregnancy protects 91% to 94% of immunized babies against hospitalization due to pertussis.
Families can talk to their regular health care providers about whether a pertussis vaccine is needed for their child, themselves or other family members.

And a former Nebraskan is behind it.
Rising from a dusty, prairie ridge along Interstate 90 near this Badlands-area town is a collection of firetrucks dubbed “Firehenge.”
Its creator, an Omaha Burke High School grad who runs a Rapid City brewery, said the ring of 10-ton firetrucks vertically arranged in a circle is more about promoting his Firehouse Brewery Company than trying to lure away visitors from Alliance, Nebraska’s popular Carhenge, about 200 miles to the south.

The new South Dakota version of the roadside attraction, which sits just off I-90, also includes a collection of buried fire hydrants called “Doghenge.” By next summer, the new henges will include a gift shop where visitors can purchase brewery souvenirs and canned beer and wine from the Firehouse Brewing Co., South Dakota’s first and oldest brewery.
“We are just having a ton of fun out here. Just come out and see it,” said Bob Fuchs, the co-owner of the brewery who graduated from Burke in 1981. And, he adds, bring your dog.
A city official in Alliance, which took over ownership of Carhenge in 2013, said she doesn’t expect local residents to mount a monumental fuss over a competing “henge” in the general vicinity.
“I think all of these things are fun,” said Shana Brown, the director of cultural and leisure services for Alliance.
As it turns out, both Carhenge and Firehenge have plenty of competition in tourism’s Carhenge-replica category.
There’s a “Foamhenge” (made out of foam) in Virginia, a “Truckhenge” near Topeka, Kansas (made out of farm trucks), a “Phonehenge” (made out old telephone booths) in South Carolina, and a “Strawhenge” (made out of bales) in Bavaria, Germany.
Years ago, a “Twinkiehenge” was built during a Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. There was once a “Snowhenge” in Michigan and a “Fridgehenge” (made out of old refrigerators) once graced the plains near Santa Fe before complaints caused its demise.

A couple decades ago, a reporter was summoned to Chadron, where a suspected “Hayhenge” had been built northeast of town. Round hay bales had been arranged in a circle at a local ranch.
In the kinda-old-henge category, there’s a full-size concrete replica of Stonehenge in Maryhill, Washington, that was built in 1918 to honor people lost in World War I.
And near Carbury, North Dakota, there’s a circle of granite walls that serves as a 21st Century solar calendar, which is the suspected purpose of Stonehenge, a prehistoric circle of stones aligned for ceremonial purposes to indicate the summer and winter solstices, and the spring and fall equinoxes.
Carhenge was built in 1987 by Jim Reinders and his relatives as a memorial to Reinders’ father, who had lived on the farm north of Alliance where the collection of 39 American cars – arranged to align with the solar calendar – now sits.
The off-beat attraction draws about 100,000 visitors a year, according to Brown, and features a staffed gift shop from May through September. An estimated 4,000 people gathered there for the solar eclipse in 2017.

Carhenge has appeared in films, commercials, television shows and in song. Last summer, it hosted a group of muralists, who painted murals on the grey-painted cars, providing a new look for the motorcar monument.
Fuchs, the Firehenge creator, said he’s not haunted by henges but had visited Carhenge shortly after it was first created.
The inspiration for his firetruck circle came during a recent marketing meeting for his brewery, which was established inside a former Rapid City firehouse built in 1915.
Fuchs has long parked old firetrucks, purchased from all corners of the Midwest, next to his brewery billboards to draw more attention to his business. He says that he often hears that visitors to Rapid City’s downtown area ask “where’s the Firehouse?”
“It’s guerilla marketing,” Fuchs said during a recent visit to Firehenge. “It’s very effective.”

At the marketing meeting, one of Fuchs’ aides was playing with a toy firetruck. Once she set it on end, vertically, an idea was born.
He said he has no plans to hoist a firetruck so it sits horizontally across two vertical trucks — like the stones at Stonehenge and cars at Carhenge. Too many liability concerns, Fuchs said. More firetrucks may be planted this spring, though, he said. And a YouTube video, featuring a visit by aliens to Firehenge, is in the works, Fuchs adds.
Over the din of a front-end loader smoothing out a gravel parking lot, he said it’s been a lot of fun.
“I get to explore my artistic side by planting fire trucks in the prairie,” Fuchs said.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)Liz Dunnebacke isn’t dying, but for a recent end-of-life care workshop in New Orleans, she pretended to be.
Dunnebacke lay still atop a folding table that was dressed as a bed, complaining that her legs hurt. Registered nurse Ana Kanellos, rolling up two small white towels, demonstrated how to elevate her ankles to ease the pain.
“ Mom’s legs are always swollen? Raise ’em up,” Kanellos said.
About 20 New Orleans residents listened intently, eager to learn more about how to care for loved ones at home when they’re nearing the end of their lives. Attendee Alix Vargas said she used to be terrified of dying. But about three years ago, a close cousin’s death led her to attend group writing workshops, helping her embrace her grief and conquer her fear.
“ I’m feeling very called towards this work,” she said. “It’s definitely knowledge that I wanted to obtain and expand my mind in that way. And this is also something that we’re all going to encounter in our lives.”

The workshop made her think about a neighbor whose mother has dementia.
“ I was immediately thinking, ‘OK, there’s someone in my immediate orbit that is experiencing this,’” Vargas recalled. ‘“Here’s a practical way to put the mutual aid in use.’”
Demand for home health care, including at-home hospice care, has skyrocketed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the number of family caregivers. An estimated 63 million people in the U.S. — nearly a quarter of all American adults — provided care over the previous year to another person with a medical condition or disability, usually another adult, according to a 2024 survey by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving. In the past 10 years, about 20 million more people have served as caregivers.
With nearly 1 in 5 Americans expected to be 65 or older by 2030, health care experts predict the demand for at-home caregivers will continue to rise. Online resources for end-of-life care are widely available, but hands-on training to prepare people to become caregivers is not, and it can be expensive. Yet untrained family members-turned-caregivers are taking on nursing and medical tasks.
Donald Trump promised more support for caregivers during his 2024 campaign, including a pledge to create new tax credits for those caring for family members. He endorsed a bill reintroduced in Congress this year that would allow family caregivers to receive tax credits of up to $5,000, but the legislation hasn’t moved forward.

Meanwhile, the Medicaid cuts expected from Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Trump signed in July, could prompt states looking to offset their added expenses to reconsider participating in optional state Medicaid programs, such as the one that helps pay for at-home hospice care. That would threaten to make dying at home even more unaffordable for low-income families, said advocates and researchers.
Advocates like Osha Towers are trying to help caregivers navigate the uncertainty. Towers leads LGBTQ+ engagement at Compassion & Choices, a national organization that focuses on improving end-of-life care, preparation, and education.
“It is certainly very scary, but what we know we can do right now is be able to just show up for all individuals to make sure that they know what they need to be prepared for,” Towers said.
In New Orleans, a nonprofit called Wake, which focuses on supporting family caregivers providing end-of-life and death care, is one of the organizations trying to help fill the knowledge gap. Wake put on the free, three-day September workshop where Dunnebacke, the group’s founder, pretended to be a dying patient. Such workshops are aimed at preparing attendees for what to expect when loved ones are dying and how to care for them, even without costly professional help. Full-time at-home care is rare.
“You don’t have to have any special training to do this work,” Dunnebacke said. “You just need some skills and some supports to make that happen.”
 
In some ways, the evolution of end-of-life care in the U.S. over the past century has come full circle. It was only starting in the 1960s that people shifted from dying at home to dying in hospitals, nursing homes, and hospice facilities.
Such institutions can provide immediate advanced medical support and palliative care for patients, but they often lack the human connection that home care provides, said Laurie Dietrich, Wake’s programs manager.
Now, more people want to die in their homes, among family, but with the support and technology that comes with modern medical facilities.

In the past decade, death doulas — who support the nonmedical and emotional needs of the dying and their loved ones — have grown in popularity to help guide people through the dying process, helping to fill that gap. Douglas Simpson, executive director of the International End of Life Doula Association, said his organization recognizes the lack of resources for death care, so it is training doulas to be community educators. He hopes doulas can be especially useful in rural communities and lead conversations about dying.
“Making people more open, more comfortable about talking about death and considering their mortality,” Simpson said.
Death doula training varies depending on the organizer, but Simpson’s group focuses on teaching attendees about the dying process, how to maintain the autonomy of the dying person, and how to be aware of how they show up to a job and take care of themselves while caring for others.
Some people who attended Wake’s workshop had also attended some form of death doula training in the past. After Nicole Washington’s mother was killed in 2023, she considered becoming a death doula. But she thought the doula training, which can cost $800 to $3,000, was clinical and impersonal, as opposed to Wake’s community-based approach.
“I feel very energized, very uplifted,” Washington said. “It’s also really nice to be in a space with people who are familiar with death and grief.”
Ochsner Health’s Susan Nelson, who has worked as a geriatrician for 25 years, said there is a need for more specialized programs to train and prepare caregivers, like Wake’s.
“Learning caregiving skills is probably, unfortunately, more trial by fire,” Nelson said.
Compassion & Choices is another organization trying to educate caregivers. Towers said the group’s training ranges from advanced planning to acting as a health care proxy to caring for the dying.
“We’ve gone to a place in our country where we’re so removed from end-of-life care in a way that we didn’t used to be,” Towers said.
She said the movement to care for people at home and give them community support has roots in the AIDS epidemic, when some doctors refused to care for AIDS patients. Friends, especially in the lesbian community, started coordinating food delivery, visits, bedside vigils, and even touch circles, where patients could receive comforting forms of touch such as hand-holding to ease pain and feelings of isolation.
“I like to look at it as a blueprint for what we can get back to doing now, which is again just prioritizing community care,” Towers said.

(Photo by Blake Fagan/AFP via Getty Images)The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.
The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat — even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.
Yet, huge amounts of food — on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it — rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.
This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane — a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.
As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.
 
Immigration policy
Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.
The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers — with lethal consequences at times.
Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.
News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”
 
Foreign aid cuts
When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.
Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.
An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.
 
Tariffs
In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.
And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.
Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.
 
Other efforts lead to more waste
Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens — which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.
In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.
Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters — including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.
The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients — to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.
Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies — though they claim to be seeking efficiency — have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food — as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.

The approval means Malone will not be required to publish his personal finances and that the financial condition of three GCI-related subsidiaries will also remain secret. The finances of GCI Liberty, the parent company, are already public due to required filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In October, Malone, 84, told the Wall Street Journal that he would be stepping away from day-to-day operations of his various companies but would retain his controlling interests. Bloomberg has estimated his net worth to be approximately $10.6 billion.
The approval was published just before 4 p.m. on Black Friday. The five governor-appointed commissioners said they were granting the requests because they were in line with the commission’s prior practices, because they don’t have the power to regulate much of GCI Liberty’s business, and because “the public interest in disclosure of the financial information of (the three subsidiaries) is outweighed by the potential competitive financial disadvantages demonstrated in the petition.”
The chair of GCI’s parent company, GCI Liberty, Malone holds shares controlling 53.5% of GCI Liberty’s voting power. But Malone’s personal power has been restricted until recently to 49.32% of the company’s voting power, regulatory filings state.
Now, Malone is seeking to increase his voting power above 50%. 
The commission’s Friday order does not decide that request; it addressed the combined requests for financial secrecy on behalf of Malone and the three GCI Liberty subsidiaries.
Alaskans submitted a combined 67 comments across three dockets related to Malone’s proposal. Almost all were opposed to the request for secrecy. 
In a response to those comments, Malone’s attorneys said “no legitimate public interest will be served by requiring (Malone) to file his personal financial information.”
The response also said that “the acquisition … will be seamless and transparent to customers because the GCI companies will continue to provide the same services to Alaska customers under their same experienced management. There will be no operational or management changes to the GCI companies as a result of the acquisition.”
GCI’s attorneys had argued that the financial statements of the three subsidiaries should stay confidential because GCI’s competitors were not required to reveal their finances, and it would be unfair for them to open their books.
“We find that disclosure … might create a competitive or financial disadvantage,” the regulators concluded.
In addition, unlike the way that water and power utilities’ rates are regulated by the RCA, GCI’s prices are not regulated by state law. 
For that reason, plus the fact that GCI Liberty’s combined financial statements are publicly available, regulators concluded, “public interest in disclosure … is outweighed by the potential competitive financial disadvantages demonstrated in the petition.”
On the request for secrecy covering Malone himself, Malone’s attorneys argued that he isn’t legally obligated to provide financial support to GCI Liberty, and thus, “requiring the submission of his personal financial information would not advance a public interest objective.”
They also argued that in 2018, when wealthy telecom entrepreneur Jane Eudy obtained full control of several Interior Alaska telecom companies by taking 100% control of American Broadband, a national firm, the RCA did not require her to publicize her finances.
Members of the public argued that disclosure is in the best interests of Alaskans. 
Megan Johnson, one of dozens of people who offered public comments, said, “Telecommunications in Alaska are not just about convenience, they are lifelines for education, healthcare, emergency services, and economic development, especially in rural and Indigenous communities. Decisions made by owners unfamiliar with our terrain, seasonal challenges, and cultural values risk undermining the progress we’ve made in closing the digital divide.”
Kirsa Hughes-Skandijs of Juneau wrote, “I am gravely concerned about the idea of concealing financial information, particularly when it comes to consolidating control of a public good like an ISP, broadcast and telecommunications company.”
Commissioners ultimately sided with Malone.
“We find the circumstances presented in these dockets similar to those we considered (in 2018),” they wrote.
“We find that under the circumstances … no legitimate public interest will be served by requiring Dr. Malone to provide a statement of financial condition.”
Commissioners are scheduled to make a final determination on Malone’s takeover by April 1.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/keyboard.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 22:56:53.300527

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The state of Alaska is close to finalizing rules for a program that would allow companies to bury carbon dioxide deep underground, a process known as sequestration.
While sequestration can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by heavy industry, it also would be a boon to the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. Many sources of natural gas on the North Slope are mixed with large amounts of carbon dioxide, and that carbon must be separated from the natural gas before shipment.  
Venting that carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would notably increase global greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating climate change.
On Tuesday, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission announced that it had completed draft regulations for the state’s “carbon storage and underground injection” program, which will involve the state taking over regulation of carbon dioxide wells from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Alaska Legislature passed — and Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed — a law in 2023 that allows the takeover. The initial phases of the project were funded by the Biden administration under a federal grant. Subsequent years are expected to cost the state about $386,000 per year.
Four other states — Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming — have already assumed regulatory authority over “class VI wells” used to inject carbon dioxide; state control has tended to permit faster action on carbon sequestration projects. 
Alaska’s proposed regulation changes cover 105 pages of technically dense language. One important change: A carbon dioxide well wouldn’t be permitted if it needed to pass through a drinking water aquifer. The state allows exemptions for other types of wells, including some that could later be converted to carbon dioxide wells.
The proposed regulations include clauses that require insurance or bonds to cover the costs of accidents and a requirement that carbon dioxide wells be firmly capped when abandoned.
The AOGCC has scheduled a public hearing on the draft rules for 10 a.m. Jan. 13 at its office in Anchorage. Members of the public interested in participating in person or by teleconference at that meeting should send an email to samantha.coldiron@alaska.gov at least two days before the meeting. Written comments may also be emailed to that address.
When the new regulations are finalized, more work remains for the state. Alaska will have to formally draft its takeover application to the EPA, which will involve another public comment period.
That application will be submitted to the EPA “ASAP after public process,” according to the state’s published timeline, and actually assuming authority over EPA-regulated carbon wells would take another 12-18 months, the state expects.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC05295-2-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-11-28 22:56:53.300527

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska regulators have assessed a $695,900 fine against Hilcorp for violations at two wells in a North Slope oil field that is a satellite of the giant Prudhoe Bay field.
Hilcorp violated regulations for up to two years when it injected enriched gas into the reservoir at the Polaris Oil Pool, which is part of the Greater Prudhoe Bay Unit, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said in a Nov. 24 decision and order.
Hilcorp is a Texas-based private company that now operates the state’s largest oil field. It is the second-biggest fine for the company ever proposed by the AOGCC.
The highest proposed fine was $720,000, which the commission initially assessed against the company in late 2015 for violations that led to an accident earlier that year that nearly killed three workers at the Milne Point oil field.
Ultimately, the AOGCC in 2017 reduced the fine to $200,000, though the commission assessed other fines at about the same time for other violations at Milne Point. Those fines ranged from $20,000 to $80,000.
In its new enforcement action, the AOGCC said the fine for the Polaris field violations is justified by the company’s pattern of violations.
“Hilcorp’s repeated failure to comply with fundamental injection authorization raises the potential for similar behavior with more serious consequences. Hilcorp’s repeated failure to comply with AOGCC rules and regulations combined with ineffective corrective actions, warrant increased civil penalties to deter similar behavior,” the order said.
Also influencing the fine size is the duration of the offenses. At one well, the unauthorized injection continued for 759 days, the AOGCC said. At the other well, the unauthorized injection went on for 480 days.
Enriched gas is sometimes injected into oil fields to boost oil recovery.
The enforcement action has been in the works for several months.
The AOGCC said that in February, it formally notified Hilcorp that it was investigating the use of enriched gas at the two wells. Hilcorp then conducted an internal investigation, responding to the AOGCC in March with an analysis of the root cause and actions to correct the problem and prevent a recurrence.
Because of that response earlier in the year, the AOGCC said it is not requiring Hilcorp to submit any further written explanation.
Hilcorp has the right to appeal the $695,900 fine. If it does not appeal, Hilcorp must pay within 30 days of the decision, the order said.
A company spokesperson said Hilcorp itself brought the violation to light and that it did not result in any safety or environmental problems.
“This issue involved a highly specific and previously unrecognized authorization gap that neither Hilcorp nor prior Prudhoe Bay operators had identified. We discovered it through an internal review informed by recent AOGCC findings, and we immediately notified the Commission and self-reported all details,” Hilcorp spokesperson Matt Shuckerow said by email.
Shuckerow said the use of enriched gas is safe and permitted on many neighboring wells “as part of an effort to increase resource recovery, which results in increased royalty and revenue to the State of Alaska,” he continued.
“It caused no safety risks, environmental harm or impacts to resource conservation. We have completed a comprehensive review of all wells to ensure no similar gaps exist and will continue working transparently with AOGCC to uphold the highest standards of safety, conservation, and regulatory compliance,” he said.
Shuckerow did not address the question of appealing the fine.
Hilcorp entered Alaska in 2011, focusing first on the Cook Inlet basin, where it is now the dominant operator, before expanding to the North Slope in 2014. In 2020, when BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. sold its remaining Alaska assets to Hilcorp and ended its activities in the state, Hilcorp became the operator of the Prudhoe Bay unit. Prudhoe Bay is now co-owned by oil companies ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Hilcorp.
Since it began operating in Alaska in 2011, Hilcorp has been the subject of 20 AOGCC enforcement orders, including the latest order, according to the commission’s website. Eleven concerned violations on the North Slope and nine concerned violations at Cook Inlet sites, according to the website.
Five of those orders were issued in 2024, including one that assessed a $452,100 fine for unauthorized injections at Prudhoe Bay of a type of gas used to enhance oil recovery.
Different type of enhanced recovery technique gets OK
Although the AOGCC faulted Hilcorp for its unauthorized use of enriched gas at Polaris, it has approved Hilcorp’s plan to try out a different type of enhanced recovery at the field.
The commission on Nov. 25 gave the go-ahead for Hilcorp to use polymer flooding at a different Polaris well for a 12-month test period.
The approval is unrelated to the Nov. 24 order and decision on the enhanced gas violation.
Polymers are natural or synthetic materials, such as cellulose and nylon, that consist of chains of molecules arrayed in a repeated pattern.
Polymer flooding in oil fields injects water-soluble polymers into reservoirs to increase oil recovery. The injected polymers blend with water to better sweep out oil. Polymer flooding is considered an effective technique to boost oil production, but it does not work in all types of reservoirs, according to scientists. The technique is most appropriate for enhanced recovery of heavier oils, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Hilcorp pioneered the use of polymer flooding on the North Slope, starting in 2018 with a test project conducted at Milne Point in collaboration with the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the U.S. Department of Energy.
The pilot project was deemed successful, and Hilcorp now uses the technique more widely at Milne Point, where polymer flooding has allowed for much better recovery of the thicker oil that is within that field.
With the help of polymer flooding and other actions, Hilcorp has increased Milne Point production from about 18,400 barrels per day in late 2014 to about 50,000 barrels per day now.
Hilcorp in 2014 acquired 50% ownership in Milne Point from BP and became the operator that year. Hilcorp took full ownership in 2020, after the acquisition from BP was completed.
The company has for years considered expanding some of the practices that have improved production at Milne Point to the parts of the Greater Prudhoe Bay Unit, which also holds some heavier oil. The now-authorized 12-month test at the Polaris well is part of that strategy.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)While the federal government steps away from climate agreements, Salt Lake City is reiterating its commitment to become more sustainable ahead of the 2034 Olympic Games with a 2040 deadline to achieve goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
In an update presented to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, the city’s Sustainability Department highlighted milestones, including a major one — the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 11% from 2009 to 2024, said Catherine Wyffels, air quality and environmental program manager at the department. 
“This is primarily due to a shift to cleaner energy sources,” Wyffels said in a presentation. “So while this 11% may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that it happened during a period of a lot of growth.”

Per capita emissions also declined 25% in the same period, she said. But there’s still a long way to go to meet the city’s climate goals.
After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.
“People are interested in anything they can do in their homes to save under utility bills,” she said. “A lot of support for clean renewable energy for both homes and businesses. People like street trees in their neighborhoods, and then also a lot of support for increased access to transit, walking and biking infrastructure.”
All of those are solutions to the city’s primary climate risks, which according to the Sustainability Department, are driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.
The report presented to the City Council is still preliminary and is scheduled for an update next spring. Whenever it’s done, the city hopes it can help trace a path to achieve its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030 and cutting 80% of emissions by 2040. 
Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said. Urban development amid continued growth is expected to exacerbate the issue.

The city’s sustainability department also highlighted some achievements including an 80-megawatt solar farm that provides a lot of the city’s municipal energy and has saved around $1.5 million in electricity bills, said Sophia Nicholas, deputy director at the city’s Sustainability Department.  
“We have a lot of the solutions at hand. We just need to have the wherewithal, political will, money, to implement them on a global basis,” Nicholas said. “And it is happening actually in other countries, but when you’re looking at our emissions profile in Salt Lake City in particular, about half of it comes from electricity, and that’s why it’s been so exciting to see that we have realized a reduction in our electric grid carbon intensity due to investments in a cleaner grid.”
Despite the progress there are still some issues. Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said. In the last 50 years, the average temperature in Utah has risen more than 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, about twice the global average. 
“That may not sound like much,” she said during the meeting, “but a few degrees change in the average temperature means our city and our region is and will continue to experience increasing drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme heat days and poor air quality.”
The city met federal air quality standards
For 15 years Salt Lake City and Provo, some of the densest cities in Utah were nonattainment areas for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-hour standards for fine particular matter pollution known as PM2.5. This month, however, the federal agency announced both municipalities were finally in compliance. 
“The achievement of cleaner air in Utah resulted from extensive planning and collaboration among the public, industry, and various government levels, leading to significant investments and the implementation of 23 new rules targeting emissions from multiple sources,” Bryce Bird, director at the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement.
He pointed to some efforts supported by the state Legislature, including incentives for retrofitting and replacing high-emission wood stoves and diesel vehicles, as well as transit updates and education campaigns. 
However, in terms of energy, the state also modified its policy in 2024 to consider energy resources by listing these attributes in order of priority: adequate, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, sustainable, secure and clean. That law worried environmentalists, who said it could lead to the prioritization of coal and move the state away from a strong market of renewables.
Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Holidays are a time for tradition, and for state officials and health advocates that means renewing the annual call for Marylanders to get vaccinated for respiratory illnesses ahead of holiday gatherings.
But with a difficult influenza variant emerging this season, combined with contrary messaging from federal health agencies and an anticipated rise in vaccine hesitancy, public health experts worry that the 2025 flu season will be more challenging than in previous years.
“It’s hard to predict these things, but it’s safe to say we’re at the beginning of the flu season, things are going to get worse,” said Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches respiratory illnesses. “So now we’ve got time to get the vaccine to try to minimize your risk.”
Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the newest challenge this year is the unanticipated influenza variant called subclade K, which public health experts say is “less sensitive” to the flu vaccine created for this year.
It’s a regular challenge for scientists developing the annual flu shot, who make an informed and researched prediction on what strand of influenza virus will be the prominent strain. But the subclade K variant is contributing this year to spikes in Canada, Japan and other countries.
“With the flu, it is often very unpredictable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director with the American Public Health Association. “They decide what the vaccine should be a very long time in advance and sometimes they don’t get it exactly right.”
But Polan, Pekosz and other experts say the vaccine still offers some protection and it is worth getting the flu shot as the season of holiday gatherings gets underway this year.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

But there lies another problem. Pekosz says that there’s still a challenge in getting people to vaccinate at all, noting that vaccine uptake has been on the decline.
State data shows that for the current respiratory season, weekly flu vaccinations peaked in October at 170,666 during the week of Oct. 11. Compare that to last year, when vaccinations peaked the week of Oct.5 at 186,868 flu shots that week.
That tracks with a national decrease in flu vaccinations between last year and now. Polan notes that there are a couple factors at play, but says the Trump administration is contributing to vaccine skepticism and overall confusion.
“The myths and misinformation that is coming out of the federal government right now related to vaccines broadly, I think a lot of people are going to be confused,” she said.
Under President Donald Trump, federal health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have broken with other public health organizations on vaccine recommendations. Most recently, the CDC issued a controversial update to its website saying that “Studies supporting a link” between autism and vaccines “have been ignored by health authorities” contrary to the agency’s previous long-running stance that there is not a link.
Polan said the fact that the CDC has brought the debate to the forefront will likely only further vaccine hesitancy.
“The conversation has become so much more mainstream that the expectation is that vaccine hesitancy is going to get worse,” she said. “And that is a difficult challenge that we have to try to address and combat.”
But the flu is not the only respiratory illness that goes around this time of year, with COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) still posing deadly threats, particularly for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.

Access to those vaccines can be challenging for people who don’t have health insurance to cover the costs, which can also result in lower vaccine uptake.
Polan notes that some families find it hard to justify paying out of pocket for a vaccine when there are more immediate challenges to handle.
“We know when people have to pay out of pocket for prevention, they’re less likely to do it,” Polan said. “If I have a limited amount of money available, what do I do? Do I take care of an immediate need? Do I take care of food, medicine, rent, mortgage, all of these things? Or do I pay for something … and I am not going to see the immediate impact?”
To counter this challenge, Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a new program last week to help uninsured and underinsured individuals get access to vaccines at local health departments in Baltimore, Garrett, Montgomery, and Somerset counties, with availability expanding to more counties in later weeks.
“Nobody should be denied basic health care because of an inability to pay,” Moore said in a written statement. “At a time when the federal government is undermining public health and creating unnecessary confusion around vaccine policy, Maryland is investing … and stepping up to make sure our people are protected.”
‘Not too late’ to get vaccinated
Pekosz hopes that the Thanksgiving holiday will give Marylanders who have not yet gotten vaccinated for the respiratory illness season an additional push to do so.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

“Now is the time that we oftentimes see a last push of people that go out looking for the vaccine,” he said. “They go to family events where people are sneezing and coughing and that makes it very real for them. I’m really hoping that this last November, December push will get some of these vaccination rates more similar to previous years.
“Cases are increasing with the flu, but they won’t peak for another four or five weeks, and the vaccine takes about two weeks to work,” he said. “It’s not too late to get your flu or your COVID or your RSV vaccine.”
Meanwhile, Marylanders are recommended to take other measures to reduce the spread of illnesses this winter, including washing hands frequently and wearing masks in crowded places like the grocery store.
“This message is primarily towards those high-risk populations,” Pekosz said. “But these are things that all of us should be practicing because everything we can do to limit the number of cases overall in the population provides that extra safety for the ones that are truly vulnerable to severe respiratory infections.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235638589.jpg,,,2025-11-28 20:56:54.505086

This location is used for late-fall and winter photography sessions. (Photo by Sanya Wason)Jerry Fleming drives a green-and-yellow John Deere tractor around Butler’s Orchard, circling the rows upon rows of Christmas trees — planted in fields he personally pulled the stumps from years ago and hand-sheared by him and his coworkers recently as they prepared for the holiday rush.
“It’s never cold here — the weather might be cold, but the way we work, it’s never cold,” said Fleming, sporting overalls, a black-and-yellow flannel and sunglasses perched on his hat
Fleming is one of the many workers at Butler’s Orchard in Germantown who work months, and years, for a couple of weeks of sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas — when they start all over again.
Ben Butler, the farm’s finance and farm manager, calls the Christmas tree farm industry an “old man’s game” in reference to the time it takes to get a tree farm to the point where a farmer can begin selling trees.
Butler’s Orchard is home to more than 44,000 trees — with 45 acres of land growing about 980 trees each. It typically takes about 10 years to get one of those fields to market size.
A field at Butler’s is cleared for replanting each year. That includes adjusting the pH of the soil and removing old stumps. It takes a few weeks to clear each stump of the 2,000-2,500 cut-your-own trees the farm sells per holiday season.

A cover crop is planted to rehabilitate the soil during the summer, followed by grass seed in September. New trees are finally planted in the spring and then tended for the next seven to eight years for the trees to get large enough to be sold.
“We are hoping we can have enough [trees] to make everyone happy, but not enough to keep in this lot,” Butler said about selling enough trees to clear out the field after the holiday season.
As they grow, trees are sheared by workers to keep the proper shape. Workers individually shear trees at sunrise in the warmer months, to avoid the heat, though sometimes work stretches through hotter times of the day. They wear shin and thigh guards to protect themselves from getting hurt from the shears, and are sometimes stung by bees who hang around the trees.
“Every tree you see is hand sheared by somebody, somewhere — it’s a tough job,” Butler said.
But Fleming says there are few complaints about the work. The mood is upbeat, said Fleming, who is known to bring a speaker to play Christmas music while he and his co-workers shape up the farm.
“People beg us to come back to work here,” Fleming said. “You never even think about what time it is.”
Fleming has worked at the farm since 2017, learning all he knows about trees during those eight years. He said the holiday season is his favorite time on the farm — bringing a nostalgic feeling of the “old days” when he would cut down a tree from the woods with his grandfather.
Christmas trees are far from the only business at Butler’s Orchard, a pick-your-own farm with a calendar that starts in April for asparagus and continues through the end of October for apples and pumpkins, and hosts seasonal festivals throughout the year. That means workers spent recent weeks from autumn-themed attractions to the holiday season, with workers shoveling thousands of pounds of corn kernels out of a play area for kids on a Friday morning, and mowing paths between the rows of trees.

The area that now holds 750 pre-cut trees was changed over from Halloween decorations in a matter of days. It now boasts a holiday themed welcome sign and a Christmas tree made from stacked painted tires, along with a playground and petting zoo. The makeover was mostly done from Nov. 10-14 — even though Agritainment Manager Gina Giantonio called her team off work on Nov. 11, when a brisk wind made the temperatures feel below freezing.
Giantonio was confident that her team would still be able to finish before the pre-cut trees arrived Nov. 19. Most of the pre-cut trees are shipped from North Carolina or Pennsylvania, to ensure taller trees are available for purchase, and the rest are grown at Butler’s.
Workers get training each year on how to load trees onto the baler, which wraps trees in netting before customers take them home, and safely manage the trees each year during training. The cut-your-own workers go through similar training, with the addition of evening out the cut end of a tree and tying it to the customer’s car.
“It takes a team — it takes a village,” Giantonio said. “You can’t just do it by yourself.”
She recalled one day during a previous season when her team worked through pouring rain and slippery ice, yet still had at least 25 customers come to the pre-cut area to purchase trees.
“You work around the elements, you’re here rain or shine — you’re a farmer,” Giantonio said.
It’s not just the elements: Christmas tree farmers have been competing artificial trees, too.
“We’re up against the fake tree — the fake tree industry has done a great job of marketing their trees and we need to combat that,” said Joncie Underwood, treasurer for the Maryland Christmas Tree Association.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Butler said some customers believe buying an artificial tree may be better for the environment than cutting down real trees, but in reality, the opposite is true. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, emit fresh air and can be recycled into mulch, according to a statement from Kristin Hanna, the Maryland Department of Agriculture’s director of special projects. Butler himself has also seen birds, bees and even praying manitises make the trees their home.
“We encourage people to buy more trees so we can plant more,” he said, “If people aren’t buying them, we aren’t planting them.”
Not only is buying a real tree better than buying an artificial tree shipped in from overseas, Butler said, but it also directly supports the local economy and farm workers.
“When you support your local farmer, not only are you helping the farmer with his or her livelihood, you are also keeping the funds here — in your state,” Underwood said. Christmas trees are a product that creates jobs and revenue in both the United States and in the farmer’s region, she said.

WASHINGTON – Earlier this month, the last-ever penny was minted in Philadelphia. Here’s what this means for Maryland consumers, businesses and collectors.
The Nov. 12 end to production of the penny had been in motion since February, when President Donald Trump announced he had met with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss the cancellation.
“For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “This is so wasteful!”
Rising costs in the production of one-cent coins played a large role in the decision, the U.S. Mint said. Over the past 10 years, the cost to produce a penny has risen from 1.42 cents to 3.69 cents per coin.
“Economic and production factors, combined with evolving consumer behavior, have made its continued production unsustainable,” the U.S. Mint said in a statement.
Around half of consumers agree, according to a February survey from the National Association of Convenience Stores.
Although the idea has been circulating for decades, this marks the first time that the Treasury Department has made that final call in discontinuing the one-cent coin.
The end of penny production is expected to save the Mint around $56 million a year.
What happens now?
The penny still will remain in circulation and be accepted as legal tender for the foreseeable future. Stores are expected to round cash transactions to the closest 5 cents, but this may ultimately prove unnecessary, given that enough pennies still remain in circulation.
The U.S. Mint produced over 3 billion pennies in 2024, adding to the 300 billion pennies currently in circulation.

Legislation has been introduced in the House to help ease the transition by codifying guidelines for businesses, but the bill has yet to be voted on. The Common Cents Act was introduced in April by Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) and is eligible for House consideration within the next few months.
The law would “provide the guidance and regulations needed to help stores, banks, and consumers make a smooth transition while modernizing our currency policy,” McClain told Capital News Service in a statement.
Canada implemented similar rounding recommendations after discontinuing its penny in 2012, also maintaining the coin as legal tender despite halting production.
Among the 21 countries in the European Union sharing the euro as the common currency, the minting of one-cent coins (and two-cent coins) has been discontinued in eight nations: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Slovakia.
Getting rid of pennies or their equivalents has been a global trend.
Australia hasn’t had one-cent and two-cent coins since 1992. New Zealand jettisoned both coins in 1990. Mexico stopped minting the one-centavo coin in 1992. South Africa ended one-cent and two-cent coin production in 2002. Brazil said farewell to its one-centavo coin in 2005.
The United Kingdom, meanwhile, hasn’t given up yet on its one-pence coins.
Impact on local businesses
Maryland Local Businesses, an organization supporting small businesses across the state, maintains that the end of the penny will have minimal impact on owner and customer experiences.
“Consumer transactions are predominantly credit card-driven … so they can still price things that way,” said Connor Edwards, marketing director of Maryland Local Businesses.
Cindy Calhoun, owner of a Washington-area souvenir penny machine company, known to collectors as “elongateds,” is not very concerned about the impact on her business.
“As with all things, we learn to adapt to changes and I expect the hobby of collecting elongateds will continue to grow and adapt,” Calhoun told CNS in a statement. She theorizes that many machines will transition to pre-loaded blank copper, or convert to stamping dimes or quarters.
Others, however, are more skeptical about the policy’s implementation.
Thanksgiving by the numbers: How much Marylanders can expect to spend this holiday

“The way the U.S. went about it was thoughtless and without consideration,” said Chris Russotti, a Virginia coin collector. “The government did not pass any legislation or provide any guidance for how to handle transactions going forward.”
A group of national trade associations wrote to congressional finance committees in September about the lack of federal guidance.
Stores across the country are hoping for guidelines on rounding, handling Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) purchases and check-cashing.
“If these remedies are not addressed in short order, it will be challenging to legally engage in cash transactions with customers in growing swaths of the country,” the letter warned.
Impact on penny’s value
“I do not think the value of the penny will rise” among collectors, Russotti said, citing the massive supply of coins already available.
Edward Van Wesep, a professor at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, shares this opinion.
“I doubt that they will ever be worth anything more than a penny, and the value of a penny goes down every day due to inflation,” he said.
However, some collectors mourn the penny’s demise.
“I enjoyed buying boxes to go through,” Russotti said. “I’m saddened that I can no longer buy them from a bank.”
“It’s a strange feeling after well over 200 years for it to be over,” said “Twosheds” Gabbard, a Louisville, Kentucky, collector.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-29 01:02:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,Kiffin’s contemplation of his own future scrambles the narrative as Ole Miss wins the Egg Bowl,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/kiffin-future-egg-bowl/,"Ole Miss defeated Mississippi State 38-19 in the Egg Bowl, but the rivalry game was largely overshadowed by Lane Kiffin's indecision about whether he would remain as the Rebels' coach.","STARKVILLE — This should be a column about how OIe Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, the best story in college football this season, threw for 359 yards and four touchdowns and played error-less football to lead the Rebels to a 38-19 Egg Bowl victory.
It should be a column about how Ole Miss completed an 11-victory regular season, the first in Mississippi NCAA Division I history.
Rick Cleveland
It should be a column about how Kewan Lacy ran around through Mississippi State for 143 yards and a touchdown and continues to give Ole Miss the ground game the Rebels lacked last season. Lacy might be the biggest reason why the Rebels will go to the FBS playoffs this year instead of falling just short as they did last year.
This could also be a column about how the future of Mississippi State football, whose name is Kemario Taylor and who raced for 173 yards and two scores and threw for another 178 yards in a losing cause. Taylor is a tall, sleek, ridiculously talented freshman you can build a program around, as 60,000 or so fans could attest on a sunny, brisk Friday afternoon at historic Scott Field..

But none of that is the focus of this column, and you knew it wouldn’t be. Lane Kiffin and his immediate future sucked the air out of all the rest of the storylines. Kiffin was the reason why several national sports reporters found their ways to Starkville on Friday. He’s the reason why so many Ole Miss fans will have their nerves wracked for at least one more day.
And, no, Kiffin had no definitive answers Friday. No, he said, he hasn’t made a decision. Yes, he allowed, he will have a decision sometime Saturday. “I feel like I’ve got to,” he said.
“It is not as enjoyable as people think it is,” Kiffin said of the decision-making process.
For those who have been completely out of touch, Kiffin is weighing offers from LSU and Florida against remaining at Ole Miss. To coach his Rebels in the playoffs, he would have to turn down the other suitors.
“I’ve got some praying to do to figure this thing out,” Kiffin said. ”I’m living one day at a time. I know that doesn’t help you, but it helps me.”
Kiffin said he had no idea when an announcement on his future will come Saturday. “If’s a fair question, but I really don’t know. It’s not my call,” he said.

Kiffin said he planned to go watch his son, Knox Kiffin, quarterback the Oxford Chargers in their playoff game  Friday night at Tupelo.
“I’m gonna go be a dad,” he said.
Above all else, Kiffin seemed hellbent on making it clear that he was never worried about how his players would respond to all the noise about his future.
“I know the storyline about the distractions,” Kiffin said. “But we build our team different. What you may think is distracting, I don’t think is. We teach our players to focus on what they control and to block out the rest. If anything, all that distraction bonds them together to stay focused.”
Perhaps, but that doesn’t explain the Rebel collapse in 2022 when Auburn was the well-publicized Kiffin suitor and the distracted Rebels lost four of their last five games.
As for the decision he faces now, Kiffin is clearly anguished. This comes from a sports writer not a mind reader, but Kiffin really did appear to be struggling with the decision post-game. That was especially apparent when he was asked about people he could reach out to for advice and when he appeared to become emotional. He mentioned Nick Saban and Pete Carroll.

“Obviously, my dad,” Kiffin said, pausing to gather himself. “I’ve really missed him this week.”
Monte Kiffin died 16 months ago.
So what will Lane Kiffin do? Hell if I know. I think, given his track record, he won’t make the call until he has to. Apparently, he has pretty much ruled out Florida and it the decision is between staying at Ole Miss or leaving for the Rebels’ bitter rival LSU.
My guess?
My guess is that Lane Kiffin really wants in his heart of hearts to take the LSU job. But then, I don’t see how any coach could lead his team to 50 victories over five seasons, lead his team to the playoffs for the national championship – and then say good-bye to them before the first playoff game is played.
Lane Kiffin might do that, but I’ll believe it only when it happens.

Native American and Alaska Native students attending a tribal college or university are eligible to submit up to two designs. The deadline for submissions is January 15, 2026.
The College Fund describes itself as the nation’s largest charity supporting Native higher education for 35 years. Pendleton Woolen Mills describes itself as “focused on a legacy of creating quality lifestyle products with timeless styling.”
Montanans have taken the prize in the past, according to records from the College Fund. Since the contest’s inception in 2019, it has had two students from Montana tribal colleges and universities as winners.

In 2020, Deshawna Anderson, of the Little Big Horn College in Crow Agency, won for the Courage to Bloom Blanket, the College Fund said. In 2021, Chelysa Owens-Cyr was the winner for Unity Blanket. The College Fund said Owens-Cyr, of Fort Peck Community College, continued to work with Pendleton to create jigsaw puzzles for her design and did “an amazing design with Nike N7 in November 2024.”
Bob Christnacht, with Pendleton, said the company’s partnership with the College Fund is one of its most meaningful and enduring collaborations.
“We are deeply honored that the students choose to share their artwork with us, and we remain humbled by the opportunity to help amplify their voices within their communities and beyond, Christnacht said in a statement. “Each student’s design is a reflection of personal story and heritage, and we are grateful to play a part in honoring their artistry and supporting their lasting legacy.”
The Tribal College Blanket Design Contest elevates the work of promising artists attending tribal colleges and universities, a press release said.
The first-place winner will have their design distributed on products internationally, with the top three designers also receiving scholarships and cash prizes. The winning design from each year is added to Pendleton’s American Indian College Fund collection of wool blankets.
Pendleton has worked with the College Fund since 1995 and has provided more than $1.5 million in scholarship support for American Indian and Alaska Native students attending tribal colleges and universities, the press release said.
TCUs provide a critical link to higher education, career advancement, and Indigenous knowledge for their communities, often located on Indian reservations and remote, rural areas. The College Fund provides millions of dollars to thousands of TCU students every year; the blanket design contest adds to that support while elevating Native art, culture, and stories.
Submission guidelines and applications are available on the College Fund’s website at https://collegefund.org/pendleton. Formal artistic study and textile design experience are not required. Contest design winners are selected each year by a committee comprised of Native American artists and College Fund and Pendleton staff.

But the state can achieve the first without worsening the second, he says.","Maryland needs more clean energy but it doesn't need to consume farmland and open space to do so, writes Marshal Cahall, who points to options lke putting solar panels on manmade structures like roof and garages, and who said nuclear needs to be an option. (Stock photo/Getty images)Maryland is losing farmland at an alarming rate, with over 12,000 acres disappearing in just the last five years. This trend jeopardizes our food supply and drives up costs for local products. At the same time, our state undoubtedly needs to increase its domestic energy production.
But the sad fact is that recent policies intended to produce energy have put even more of our finite farmland at risk, threatening the very future of Maryland’s agriculture.
For instance, a new law overrides local zoning to fast-track solar development on agricultural land. Similarly, the controversial Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line raises the possibility of using eminent domain on farm parcels. These actions prioritize energy development without considering the long-term cost to one of our state’s most valuable resources — our finite and limited farmland.

Fortunately, we don’t have to choose between energy and agriculture. We can meet our energy goals by investing in smarter, more sustainable solutions.
First, let’s prioritize solar development on existing infrastructure. Solar panels should be placed on rooftops, over parking lots or on brownfields — areas that are already developed and don’t require the sacrifice of farmland. Incentivizing this approach would make these locations the default for new solar projects.
Second, we can leverage existing rights-of-way for new transmission lines. At the same time that the MPRP was being discussed, Baltimore Gas and Electric advanced a 59-mile project in a very similar area by utilizing existing pathways for transmission lines. Their project showed that by building necessary infrastructure on existing pathways, you avoid the need for eminent domain and prevent conflict with landowners.
Finally, and perhaps most effectively, Maryland can invest in nuclear energy. Long gone are the days when investing in nuclear energy was considered a risky proposition. Nuclear power is clean, highly efficient, and requires a minimal land footprint to produce a massive amount of energy.
Members of the Maryland Farm Bureau recently had the opportunity to tour Maryland’s lone nuclear energy facility, Calvert Cliffs. We were incredibly impressed by the efficiency, production and safety measures taken by the operation. This single facility contributes 87% of the state’s clean, carbon-free energy output. Imagine the impact even a single new reactor could have on our energy needs without consuming precious farmland.
Moving forward, our state leadership must choose a path that protects our farms while powering our future. By investing in these common-sense solutions, we can ensure Maryland remains a leader in both agriculture and energy.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-panels-in-field-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 18:57:02.465483

Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

The lawsuit is the second the state has faced that attempts to stop Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The patients filed their lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday, and are seeking class-action status to protect all Idahoans on the program. 
Their arguments echo claims made by mental health clinics in a state court lawsuit last week: That the cuts would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and overall public safety. 
The cuts, patients argue, “will have cascading negative consequences for plaintiffs and for their families, including increasing acuity of mental health symptoms, more frequent and intense mental health crises, and an overall functional decline in their day-to-day lives not only impacting family and social connections but also their own well-being and personal safety as well as the safety of others and the public at large.”
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

“Acting under color of state law, the government-official defendants either have directed or authorized the State’s contractor to make devastating changes to the administration of the … program,” patients argue in the lawsuit. “But their actions were unlawful, and this Court should grant relief to the plaintiffs.” 
One patient suing, identified only as Ramon in the lawsuit, has seen his symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia drastically improve since receiving services through the program that is slated to be cut, the lawsuit says.
“Ramon is a new person. He has leveled out, is consistent with his medications, and follows through with his … treatment and management plans,” the lawsuit says. Since receiving services through the program, “Ramon has not been incarcerated, hospitalized, or institutionalized, which is quite a change for him given his prior pattern of incarceration and hospitalization.”
Before he was on the program, “his family relationship had been severed,” the lawsuit says. But the program, the lawsuit said, “has been instrumental in reuniting Ramon with his family.” 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Humphreys, 68, feels betrayed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. “As federal employees, we sacrificed good salaries in the private sector because we thought the benefits from government would be better now, in retirement,” he said.
As the nation’s largest employer-sponsored health insurance program, the FEHB Program covers more than 8.2 million federal government employees and retirees, and it was once celebrated as a national model for controlling costs while giving enrollees many health plan options.
But next year, average enrollee premium payments in the system are set to jump more than 12%, on top of a 13.5% hike in 2025. The two-year increase is higher than what many private employers and their workers are experiencing.
The FEHB rate hikes are similar to those for plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges — excluding the government subsidies most enrollees get, a major point of contention on Capitol Hill. The premiums insurers charge for Obamacare plans are rising 26% on average for 2026, following a 4% increase this year.
What’s making the latest hike in FEHB premium payments even harder to stomach for millions of federal employees is its timing: The 2026 increase was announced in October, when many federal workers were on unpaid furlough during the 43-day government shutdown.
Unlike most private employers, the FEHB Program gives its enrollees numerous health plans to choose from. That allows some people to lower their monthly premium payments by switching to plans with higher deductibles or copayments. But each year only about 5% of enrollees switch plans, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the program.
Humphreys, who has stayed with the same health plan for decades despite steadily higher prices, said it’s difficult determining which plan is best based on their health conditions. He has glaucoma and diabetes, and his wife, Julianne, has faced heart issues.
Their FEHB plan covers costs for their care not covered by Medicare, which typically pays 80% of their health bills.
“There’s a fear that if you do something and change plans and it’s wrong, you could be in a bad spot,” he said.
Open enrollment for federal employees and retirees runs through Dec. 8.
Among the factors causing premiums to increase, according to OPM, are an aging federal workforce with more chronic conditions, as well as prescription drug use, including pricey GLP-1 medications for weight loss.
About 42% of federal employees are over the age of 50, compared with 33% in the general workforce, OPM says. About 7% of federal employees are under the age of 30, compared with about 20% of workers overall.
OPM officials said the Trump administration’s policies aimed at lowering drug costs and focused on prevention of costly medical conditions will hopefully help it control premiums in the future.
“None of these initiatives of course will happen overnight – turning a $79 billion ship takes slow and steady progress,” Shane Stevens, OPM’s associate director for health care and insurance, said in a news release. “But, we are committed to improving the quality of life and quality of care for our members while also ensuring that healthcare remains accessible and affordable for those who work (or have worked) for the American people.”
OPM didn’t respond to requests for comment.

John Holahan, a health policy fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, said OPM’s explanation left out a key reason for rising premiums: hospital consolidation. While the FEHB Program is a collection of health plans, in many markets — including the Washington, D.C., area — those insurers must negotiate with a handful of powerful health systems that have bought up other hospitals and doctors. That market power enables them to drive prices higher on FEHB plans, he said.
Jacqueline D. Bowens, president and CEO of the D.C. Hospital Association, said in a statement that “the costs borne by patients are not determined solely by the care they receive, but by how insurance companies choose to price, reimburse, and restrict access to that care.”
Holahan said it’s surprising that FEHB premiums are rising even faster than those of other, smaller employers. But he is not surprised federal employees don’t switch plans more often, even when it may be in their financial interest.
“It’s that people find the health care world so complicated,” he said. Holahan, a noted health economist, said he, too, finds it daunting to switch Medicare health plans.
Mike Lindquist, a scientific review officer for the National Institutes of Health, said he’s not happy with the rise in his premium payments the past two years. “It’s tough, as it’s a big expense.”
Lindquist, 43, who lives in Brunswick, Maryland, has been on the same Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan through the FEHB Program the past few years even though he evaluates his options each fall.
“By not switching, you don’t have to worry about choosing a new plan that might not take your practitioners,” he said.
Jonathan Foley, a health consultant who worked as a senior adviser at OPM during the Biden administration, said premium increases will be a hardship for many enrollees. While the FEHB Program offers 200 health plans in total, with about 10 to 20 in each geographic market, enrollment is concentrated in just a handful of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
“This concentration reduces competition and gives outsize influence” to rate increases by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Foley said in an email.
He said the FEHB Program also faces higher costs because it requires its health plans to cover GLP-1 medications, such as Wegovy and Ozempic. Nationally, fewer than half of large employers offer this benefit, according to the Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Another cost pressure has been more members using behavioral health benefits to treat depression and anxiety since the start of the covid pandemic, Foley said.
The Trump administration’s federal workforce reductions also have contributed to cost increases, Foley said. OPM has lost about a third of its employees in the past year, leaving fewer workers to oversee the FEHB Program and negotiate with dozens of health insurers, he said.
“The workforce reductions and the unpredictable nature of policymaking in the Trump administration has created considerable uncertainty among health insurance carriers,” Foley said. “The response of actuaries to increased uncertainty is to raise rates.”
A Government Accountability Office report this year found that recent OPM staffing vacancies led to a suspension of fraud risk assessments in the FEHB Program.
John Hatton, staff vice president for policy and programs at an advocacy group called the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said higher prices mean it’s critical for FEHB members to shop and compare plans for next year. “The program was designed to promote competition to mitigate and drive down costs,” he said.
Hatton said OPM surveys show the main reasons people don’t change plans is they are overwhelmed by their options and worried about making a mistake. Switching to a plan with even a slightly higher deductible, he said, could save people a few hundred dollars a month on premiums.
But Humphreys, the Georgia retiree, said he likes that his current plan comes with low out-of-pocket costs for him and his wife. They owed little money when his wife suffered a kidney stone infection and sepsis, which put her in the hospital for 12 days.
That reassurance will soon come at a higher cost: Their FEHB and Medicare premiums will take up more than half of his pension check next year after accounting for taxes.
“I can take a lower-premium plan, but it’s a gamble I am not willing to take,” he said.

In Southeast Vermont, a group of school districts are already out of the gate putting into practice a key feature of the redistricting task force’s proposal — forming regional cooperatives to share services. 
For several years, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union — which serves students in the towns of Woodstock, Barnard, Bridgewater, Killington, Plymouth, Pomfret and Reading — has been partnering with seven nearby districts in Windham, Windsor and Rutland counties to pool their resources under the Vermont Learning Collaborative.
Officials there say the initiative shows clear cost benefits and improvements to educational programs, two central goals of Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law.

The districts’ collaborative — a precursor to the type of regional entity now being proposed by the task force — facilitates the sharing of services in special education, professional development, human resources and more.
A state law passed in 2024 enables districts in Vermont to form a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, or BOCES. The Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s collaborative will soon be officially recognized by the state’s Agency of Education as the first in the state.
The five regional partnerships envisioned in the task force’s proposal, called Cooperative Service Areas, would similarly allow districts to collaborate and save money by sharing services at scale.
The educational structure is commonplace in much of the United States. Forty-three states, including smaller, rural states like West Virginia, Maine, Mississippi and Montana, utilize a form of regional cooperative service agencies.
The collaborative has generated cost savings for participating districts, officials with the Mountain Views Supervisory Union said. Districts that would otherwise be siloed and forced to pay for duplicative services have been able to access professional development services at a larger scale thanks to their collaborative, saving individual districts an average of 66% on those costs, according to Jill Graham, the collaborative’s executive director.
The task force’s proposal has generated interest throughout the state. Other districts have approached the Agency of Education about adopting a similar structure, according to previous reporting. Campaign Vermont, an advocacy group, said in a release that the state could save $334 million annually if districts share services.
The Mountain Views districts’ special education services have also seen improvement. Their collaboration has led to a reduction in the number of students who are placed outside of member districts, school officials said.
“We are seeing the impact of this resource,” said Sherry Sousa, the superintendent of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union. “And we’re getting the payback.”
Sousa says the Agency of Education is reviewing the articles of agreement between the partnering supervisory districts and will soon approve its formation. The approval comes with a $10,000 grant from the state.
‘Legacy inefficiencies’
The task force’s proposal was finalized in a draft report that will be sent to the legislature by December 1. But it has faced heavy criticism from Gov. Phill Scott’s administration.
Scott has made direct consolidation of the state’s 52 supervisory unions and supervisory districts and 119 school districts a key priority of the broader reform envisioned in Act 73. 
The change would wrest control of local spending away from school districts, but much of the law’s changes to education finance may not happen without agreement on a new map of districts.
Regional cooperatives are one facet of the task force’s proposal for the public education reform envisioned by Act 73. The group is recommending voluntary mergers of the state’s school districts.
Those mergers could be incentivized by using state construction aid to facilities creating regional high schools, a more long-term proposal in their recommendation.
Gov. Phil Scott and his education secretary, Zoie Saunders have panned the proposal, and said the task force ignored their mandate to consolidate the state’s existing districts and draw new maps of those possible boundaries.
Saunders, in a letter to the task force, said their plan “inverts the Governor’s original plan” by maintaining the state’s 52 supervisory unions and districts and 119 school districts, “while adding” five regional entities on top.
Each regional cooperative, she wrote, would “have its own governing board, executive director, and staff—expanding, not reducing, administrative footprint,” she wrote.
“The result is more governance, more overhead, and the preservation of legacy inefficiencies,” she wrote.
Scott was more forceful in his criticism, telling reporters this month that the task force “failed” in their task.
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Task force members have pushed back on this. In a draft of their final report, task force members wrote that they could not find evidence that direct consolidation of school districts would help alleviate primary cost drivers like health insurance, special education, facilities and transportation.
“Regional coordination, shared staffing, and well-planned high school collaborations address these drivers more effectively than mandated structural change,” the task force wrote.
The disagreements between task force members and officials in Scott’s administration foreshadow a difficult legislative session to come. Lawmakers will have to agree on a new map of school districts for much of Act 73 to see the light of day.
The debate has generated a vast amount of uncertainty in the state’s public education landscape. Keri Bristow, the board chair of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, said the task force’s proposal preserves a local democratic process.
“You can make any map you want, but if the people don’t have any affinity with the other groups they’re pushed with, there’s just going to be a lot of problems trying to meld those people, those groups, into an Uber School District,” Bristow said. “We would prefer to choose our partners.”

The state Department of Corrections announced the Thanksgiving night death of 37-year-old Larry Thomas Dukes Franklin on Friday. Franklin was incarcerated at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s maximum security Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
DCI spokesman Tony Mangan confirmed that the agency is investigating the situation as a suspected overdose.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Franklin’s death is the fourth this month in the state’s prison system. Overdoses are suspected in two of the other November deaths, of 33-year-old Travis Long Fox at the penitentiary, and 46-year-old Timothy Tyree at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
Shane Ostercamp, 44, also died in November. He died in a comfort care setting in Springfield.
Five other inmates died of suspected or confirmed overdoses this year before November, all but one from a synthetic drug known as “K2” or “spice.” 
Attorney General Marty Jackley has indicted a handful of people in and outside the prison system for drug distribution, including one former corrections officer. Of the eight total suspected overdose deaths this year, four occurred after Jackley announced the most recent round of charges in mid-September. One of the deaths occured less than a week after the press conference announcing them.
Twenty-two men have now died in Department of Corrections custody in calendar year 2025, the highest figure in recent memory. In addition to the drug deaths, four died by suicide and others died of natural causes.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.
“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”
“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”
The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.
Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.
Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.
“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”
One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”
All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.
“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”
“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.
After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:
“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”
Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.
Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.
“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.
“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”

He is a second-generation member of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, where he serves as business manager of Local 668. He also serves as president of the Vermont AFL-CIO, advocating for workers’ rights in the Green Mountain state.
Recently, the richest person in the world was granted a salary of $1 trillion over 10 years.
Let that sink in. $1,000,000,000,000.


One person will receive ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS per year for 10 years to run a company. One person, already unimaginably wealthy, was handed more money than the total budget of the state of Vermont, not to mention that a trillion dollars is larger than most countries’ GDP.
At the same time of that announcement, tens of thousands of federal employees went to work and didn’t get paid because of the government shutdown. Millions of poor and working-class Americans didn’t receive their SNAP benefits and struggled to feed their families. And health care costs for working people are sky rocketing with no end in sight.
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives, the leaders we elected to run the government, didn’t meet for over a month. The president, with no sense of irony, threw a Great-Gatsby–themed party, a celebration of excess named after a story that was supposed to warn us about it.
The rich got richer. People went to work and didn’t get paid. Millions went hungry. And somehow, this has become normal.
What is happening in our country?
We used to value work. We believed that if you worked hard, you’d earn enough to live with dignity. One job could support you and your family. Now, too many companies and politicians treat workers as disposable and view the economy not as a shared project, but as a game to be won by a handful of shareholders.
The results are everywhere: record corporate profits, record CEO pay, and record levels of despair among working people. The rich continue to spend, propping up our economy while millions of people look for food. When the system rewards hoarding instead of helping, and speculation instead of service, it’s no wonder faith in the American dream is fading.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can value labor over luxury, community over greed, and people over profits. But that means demanding more — from our government, from corporations and from ourselves. 
At the Vermont AFL-CIO, we  work every day to support workers throughout the state and raise up their voices. Through the power of collective bargaining and union organizing, working families in the Green Mountain State can restore hope for tomorrow.
Our strength lies in our unity, whether on the picket line, at the bargaining table or in the halls of government. We are one movement fighting for justice for all. We are building a future where every Vermonter earns a fair wage, has a safe workplace and can live with dignity and security. 
Because if we keep rewarding the richest for taking and punishing the rest for working, we won’t just lose our paychecks. We’ll lose our soul as a country.

(Photo by Keith Weller/USDA)Artificial intelligence and robots have potential to boost agricultural production — and their possibilities are only beginning, a University of Florida researcher told the Florida Senate last week.
UF broke ground this month on the Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture at the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Hillsborough County.
According to Nathan Boyd, a professor at UF studying weed science and associate director of the center, artificial intelligence will provide a 35% boost to agricultural production, including in Florida, by 2030. 
“We’re just seeing the start of what artificial intelligence and robotics can do in agriculture,” Boyd said while presenting to the Senate Committee on Agriculture.
Using AI to target spraying and harvesting crops could allow use of fewer pesticides and streamline processes otherwise done by humans, he said.
“Labor is a critical issue. The reason it’s becoming more of an issue is, number one, we do have aging farm operators — that’s part of it. We also do not have or have a very, very small domestic labor force for agriculture, which means we’re relying on labor outside of our domestic population, and the result of that has been labor shortages. And if you look at population trends here and in other countries, this is going to get worse, not better,” Boyd continued. 
As of May 2024, Florida had 9,640 crop, nursery, and greenhouse workers, the second-most in the United States, behind only California, which has more than 10 times as many workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area had the highest number in the state and 11th most nationwide.
As of April, Florida farmers paid near the bottom of the nation to field crop workers at $15.71 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Earlier this year, in the thick of legislative discourse about cracking down on illegal immigration, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson predicted the effort would not affect farm help. About two-thirds of crop farmworkers in the U.S. are immigrants, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. At the time, Simpson said H2A visas give permission to “the vast majority” of farmers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis.

“We have to come up with a solution of, ‘How are we going to continue to grow the food that we do in Florida, understanding that we feed our country in the winter time? How are we going to continue to do that with fewer people?’ So, here comes the robots,” Boyd said. 
As technology improves, so do yields and quality of products, Boyd said. Technology can monitor plant health and development.
The technology, although often more accessible to larger growers, can be developed for small growers, according to Boyd.  
The Florida Department of Commerce, upon groundbreaking for the center, named agricultural technology as a new target industry. That means the state recognizes it as having a high potential to generate “significant returns on investment through job creation, innovation, and long-term growth.”

Robotic harvesting, a $236 million industry in 2022, is expected to be worth $6.8 billion by 2030, according to Boyd. Agriculture drones are expected to constitute a $18 billion dollar industry in five years, too.
The center at UF will have resources to design and build robots for agriculture, with about 100 employees. In the 2025 state budget, lawmakers dedicated $2.25 million for the center.

The wishlist for achieving a more stable health care system in Vermont is a long and lofty one: By 2031, the Agency of Human Services says it aims to strengthen the rural health care workforce in the state and increase access to timely care in those rural areas, all while increasing quality and reducing cost. 
One big piece of achieving those goals rests in moving more of the health care Vermonters receive outside of hospitals, the agency argues in its latest vision for hospital transformation, made public last week.
In a bid for a five-year federal rural health grant worth at least $500 million to the state, the agency proposes a sweeping range of expenditures, ranging from the broad — like allocations for incentivizing primary care providers to increase appointment access — to the specific — like funding more recovery housing for those with substance use disorders or investing in dialysis and ventilator units in nursing homes, rather than hospitals.

What might become a reality depends in part on grant funding decisions the federal government is expected to make by the end of this year.
The national opportunity became available in September after funding for the program was inserted into the federal budget reconciliation package to win the needed support of rural Senate Republicans concerned about the impacts of Medicaid spending cuts in that bill. 
Since then, health care professionals across Vermont have closely watched how the state might use the grant, to solidify the otherwise eroding foundation of the health care system in the state. 
“It does give us a lifeline if we use it really well,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told VTDigger in October, before the state submitted an application.
Still, now that the agency’s application is public, much remains up in the air about how much funding will come to the state and what exactly it will go toward when it does.
The new funding availability comes at a time when the majority of Vermont’s hospitals face serious solvency risks and Vermonters bear some of the highest health care costs in the country. At the same time, the state’s rural populations are overall less healthy than the rest of the state, with higher rates of chronic disease, obesity, opiod-related death and suicide.
Many providers, patients, regulators and lawmakers in the state agree that the system is in dire need of a radical reboot. Some are still waiting for the details of that reboot to become more concrete.
“The proposal is more of a list of priorities than a detailed plan of what Vermont would do with federal funds if or when they arrive,” Alex Garlick, a UVM political science professor who specializes in health care policy but who is not involved in the application process, told VTDigger. 
“The ideas for shoring up the delivery of rural health care are sound, but I’d categorize them as incremental instead of transformational,” he said.
‘A holistic view’
Part of the plan’s high-level scope is because of how the federal government plans to dole out the funding.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they will award $10 billion a year between 2026 and 2030. Each year, half of that will go equally to each approved state — suggesting that each of the 50 eligible U.S. states are expected to get $100 million per year. The remaining $5 billion pot will go to states based on a more competitive grant evaluation criteria. 
Agency staff think it’s likely that Vermont will receive only its share of the half promised to all states, said Julie Mazza Olson, AHS’s director of Medicaid and health systems, who oversaw the application process. The federal agency has already posted its scoring metrics that the state can judge its eligibility against.
Nevertheless, the state proposed a budget for $200 million of spending each year in part to make a bid for the higher amount. But also the state agency can’t be sure which of the proposed priorities the feds will accept as ways to spend the state’s allocation, so Olson says the agency intentionally made the application flexible.
Olson said her agency tried to build upon programs for health system transformation that the state has already set in motion largely through a 2022 law, known as Act 167, a bill focused on shoring up the state’s hospitals. 
That was a practical necessity because the application needed to come together quickly: CMS released the applications in mid-September and gave states until Nov. 5 to submit them. 
“It’s a really really short amount of time to develop a plan and get the kind of input that you want when you’re doing something as complex as this,” Olson said.
Still, while trying to move quickly by building off existing projects, Olson said that the agency also tried to broaden the scope beyond hospital-specific reform. Often receiving care in a hospital is more expensive than getting the same treatment in an outpatient clinic or independent facility.
“If we’re going to have less care in hospitals, we’re going to need more care somewhere else,” Olson said. “There are other providers who we haven’t really engaged with in the same way on transformation.” 
Specifically, the application identifies investments in staff, technology and supplies for nursing homes, home health care, community mental health and substance use clinics, as well as through increased support and training for EMTs and paramedic emergency response teams.
Garlick, the UVM professor, specifically pointed to training programs for licensed nursing assistants and supporting primary care as good ideas for ways to strengthen the delivery of rural health care. 
“There are also outside-the-box considerations, including grants to increase the housing stock available to health care workers, which show the state is taking a holistic view of the problems related to health care finance,” he said.
A far bigger federal challenge  
Health care officials remain clear-eyed about the importance these funds can have in boosting a system in such dire straits. 
“Vermont’s healthcare system, including all provider types, remains under significant financial strain,” Foster, the care board chair, wrote in a Friday email to VTDigger. “We are seeing many service line closures and disruptions to patient care.  Hospitals are expected to continue to experience great financial pressure at a time when Vermonters cannot afford to pay more for healthcare.” 
Foster wrote that he was optimistic that Vermont’s application for the program would garner support, adding that he was encouraged by its recognition of the importance of preventative care and community-based providers. “Vermont has committed to intentional and meaningful health system transformation, and these critical funds would bolster our ability to transition Vermont into a sustainable and modern health system,” he said.
Still, strong headwinds remain against the rural health care system across the country as well as in Vermont. 
The changes to Medicaid enshrined in the big budget reconciliation President Donald Trump signed into law this July could result in a $137 billion loss to rural hospitals over 10 years, an analysis by the health care news organization KFF found. Comparatively, this five-year $50 billion rural health transformation grant, also included in that law, cannot balance the scale.
“The dollars that are available to us are really addressing a different set of concerns than the dollars that we’re losing. This is an opportunity, and we want to use this opportunity, but from a policy perspective it doesn’t make up for [other losses],” Olson said. 
Those losses don’t include the potential drop in income that rural hospitals can expect to come as a result of the loss of some of the federal subsidies for plans purchased on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Thousands of Vermonters are expected to reduce or entirely drop their insurance due to the increased expense.
The KFF authors also point out another imbalance of this funding opportunity that Vermont officials are also keenly aware of: While the changes to Medicaid would require future congressional action to ever reverse the cuts, this federal funding opportunity is finite. After five years, it is gone.
“It’s one-time money, so we have to think about how we can invest in ways to sustain it or turn things on and off,” Olson said. 
It’s an opportunity, she sees, to strengthen the system at the root, to do things like invest in concrete pieces of equipment — ventilators, mobile care technology — or programs that will have long dividends for the state, like education and training for the health care workforces.
She is wary of seeing it as the catch-all solution for all the challenges the system is facing.  
“The rural health transformation grant is not our entire healthcare system or all the things we’re doing on healthcare reform,” she said. “It’s an opportunity that we want to make the best of, even if it does not solve all of our problems.”

Free.,Trump social media post claims to void Biden orders,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-social-media-post-claims-void-biden-orders,,"President Donald Trump said Friday he will try to reverse any law, pardon or still-in-effect executive order that former President Joe Biden signed with an autopen, though it wasn’t immediately clear how that would work or whether it would be legal. Trump declared in a social media post that any documents Biden signed with the autopen are “hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.”“I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” Trump alleged. “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The White House press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for the list of documents Trump believes he has the ability to rescind based on the manner they were signed.States Newsroom also asked the Trump administration if officials believe the president would need to sign an executive order in order to implement his social media post. Experts dismissed earlier autopen challenge The post was similar to one Trump published in March when he claimed any pardons Biden signed with the autopen were void, something legal experts said at the time was “absurd” and a “red herring.”Trump brought up his frustration with autopen use again in June when he ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when and why Biden administration staff used an autopen. Trump said during an Oval Office appearance at the time he hadn’t found any evidence Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”Biden and spokespeople working for him have repeatedly said he knew what official documents were being signed in his name and rejected claims that White House staff used the autopen without his authorization or knowledge. Biden released a statement in June following the Trump memorandum, saying the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote at the time. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""While presidents have regularly rescinded their predecessors executive orders, usually within their first few days or weeks in office, Congress would very likely need to act in order to alter or eliminate any laws that Biden signed with an autopen. Trump seeking to overturn a law, or part of a law, unilaterally would likely lead to a lawsuit over whether he holds that power. Trump doesn’t cite legal authorityIt also wasn’t immediately clear what legal authority Trump believes he has as president to undo pardons if Biden used an autopen to sign the documents. David Super, a constitutional and administrative law professor at Georgetown University, told States Newsroom in March that “the Constitution does not require signatures for pardons. It simply says the president has the power to pardon.”“So if President Biden wanted to simply verbally tell someone they're pardoned, he could do that. It wouldn't have to be in writing at all,” he said. “Administratively, of course, we want things in writing. It makes things a lot simpler, but there's no constitutional requirement.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 20:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT strengthens data protections in wake of federal requests,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/ct-data-protections-ice/,"Federal officials approached CT's third-party vendor, asking for SNAP recipients' personal information. State officials took it as a warning.","Concerned that residents’ locations and schedules could be obtained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, state lawmakers passed a bill this month to prevent public agencies from sharing such personal information.
The bill prohibits state and municipal agencies, including schools, from sharing an individual’s address, hours of work, public agency appointments or “any other information that provides the date, time or place where such individual may be located.”
Scott Gaul, the state’s chief data officer, said he will be working with agencies on procedures that protect the outlined information and how to handle requests for data.
“The underlying intent of the legislation is to make sure people can trust in government and feel that they can interact with state agencies and the benefits that they’re entitled to,” said Gaul.
Since March, the Trump administration has required states to provide “unfettered access” to information like names, birth dates, addresses and Social Security numbers from all state programs that receive federal funding. Connecticut did not comply.
Then, federal officials approached the state’s third-party vendor for SNAP recipients’ personal information.
The vendor turned down the request, but it was a warning to Gaul and others that personal information could be obtained through unexpected — and “aggressive” — means, Gaul said.
Gaul spoke recently at a series of seminars geared at helping nonprofits understand how to protect their clients’ sensitive information when data requests come through the back door.
At one seminar, Eric Giannella, a researcher at Georgetown’s Massive Data Institute, advised nonprofits to provide default answers for sensitive questions and use encryption keys.
But Giannella acknowledged that many of these methods have traditionally only been available to large organizations that have designated technology staff.
For Tabitha Sookdeo, executive director of CT Students for a Dream, it feels like a “Catch-22. You’re trying to protect [your clients’] data, but you really need it for your organization’s function.”
For example, in July, Sookdeo needed to find the parent contact information for a high schooler who was picked up by ICE. Sookdeo needed to have the data on hand but was concerned that if it were obtained by ICE, it would present a risk for her client. 
“We have to become data experts,” she said.
The new legislation protects data held by Connecticut agencies, but it cannot stop federal agencies, such as the IRS, from sharing data with ICE. 
Sookdeo has been fielding questions from young immigrants and their families about whether to pay their taxes this year. For many, “the benefits outweigh the risk, because, for lots of immigration purposes, if you’re filing and you’re in the process of trying to get something, you have to show continuous tax paying activity,” said Sookdeo.
Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit in July challenging the Trump administration’s effort to collect SNAP recipients’ personal data. He also joined a lawsuit that blocks HHS from sharing personal information of Medicaid recipients with ICE.
Sookdeo notes that the new legislation does not specifically address reproductive health care, or the sex or gender of a person. Chelsea-Infinity Gonzalez, director of public policy and advocacy at the ACLU, said, “It’s encouraging that the legislature recognized this and took an initial step during the special session.”
While Connecticut has existing shield laws and “best practices” around maintaining demographic data privacy, “something that Connecticut does not have are really holistic privacy policies for the public sector,” said Gaul. “I think this is kind of a step in that direction. But, you know, there is more that could be done on that.”
Democratic control of both the executive and legislative branches has assisted Connecticut’s ability to protect its own data, Gaul said. Last week’s legislation passed largely on party lines, with three Republicans joining the vote to send the bill to Lamont’s desk.
In Vermont, Republican Governor Phil Scott obliged the federal government’s request and handed over the data of SNAP beneficiaries, despite opposition from a Democratic-controlled legislature.
Connecticut has also been impacted by budget cuts to federal data collection.
States rely on the federal government to “set standards” of how data like race and address are collected, Gaul said. The Census homepage went dark one weekend, and the Department of Justice no longer collects data on gender-identity-based hate crimes, raising doubt about the reliability of federal statistical data.
For now, Connecticut will be selective of any cross-state data sharing initiatives, Gaul said. Some initiatives may been a “great idea three years ago,” but not now.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25161836500390-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217

About a decade ago, a group of visitors pointed to the photos and asked: Who are they?
When Clyburn explained, the visitors told South Carolina’s longest-serving representative they thought he was the first Black congressman elected in the state. Clyburn told his staff perhaps it was time to write a book about the history of the state’s Black representatives, himself included.

“The First Eight,” which hit shelves Nov. 11, interweaves the achievements and challenges of the state’s Black representatives in post-Civil War 1800s with Clyburn’s own experience during his three decades in Congress, he said.
“People are shocked when I tell them that there were eight African Americans representing South Carolina in Congress before me,” Clyburn told the SC Daily Gazette. “They are absolutely flabbergasted when I tell them at one point South Carolina had five members of the House of Representatives, and four of the five were Black.
“And they are beyond belief when I tell them that there’s 95 years between number eight on this list and yours truly, number nine.”
Rep. George Washington Murray left office in 1897. Clyburn was first elected in 1992.
For years, South Carolina’s only Democratic congressman worked on the stories strictly as historical accounts. That changed with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by a mob attempting to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the next president. The attack only delayed certification by hours.
Clyburn’s mind went back to the 1876 governor’s race, when the paramilitary Red Shirts who supported Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton used violence and intimidation to keep Black men from voting. Hampton’s victory brought the end of Reconstruction, the post-Civil War period of federal control in the South, as President Rutherford B. Hayes — needing the electoral votes of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana to take office — agreed to withdraw federal troops.
Clyburn decided to draw parallels from the experiences of his predecessors to current events.
“What I decided was, rather than just inform, it needed to be sort of constructive,” Clyburn said.
Nation’s first
Clyburn’s book begins with Joseph Rainey, the nation’s first Black congressman, who represented South Carolina from 1870 to 1879.
Though Rainey was born a slave in Georgetown, his father bought the family’s freedom when he was 10 and moved to Charleston, where he was secretly tutored and worked as a barber at the Mills House hotel. After the Civil War, Rainey helped found the state Republican Party and was a delegate to the majority-Black convention that wrote South Carolina’s 1868 constitution that allowed the state to rejoin the Union.
Rainey won a special election two years later to represent South Carolina’s 1st District and was reelected four times, becoming the longest-serving Black congressman during Reconstruction. In 2022, a room in the U.S. Capitol was renamed in his honor.
Clyburn’s narrative tells the stories behind each of the eight men.
Among them are Robert Smalls, who Clyburn called “the most consequential South Carolinian who ever lived.”
Also born into slavery, Smalls hijacked the Confederate supply ship he worked on in 1862 and steered his family and fellow enslaved crew members to freedom. Piloting past Confederate forts, he delivered the ammunition-laden Planter to the Union.
Smalls then became the first Black man to pilot ships for the U.S. Navy.
He too helped write the state’s 1868 constitution, which undid the Black Codes and promised free education for all children and voting rights to all men. His five terms in the U.S. House are especially remarkable when considering they followed the end of Reconstruction and the reversal of rights for freed slaves.
He also attended the post-Reconstruction rewriting of the state constitution. As a Black delegate to the mostly white 1895 convention, Smalls pleaded unsuccessfully for a constitution guaranteeing “fair and honest” elections, even while recognizing the purpose of the convention was to disenfranchise Black voters.
A statue of him is in the works, for placement on the Statehouse grounds.
Although Smalls’ story stands out for its heroism, the most interesting story to Clyburn is that of Thomas Miller, the state’s seventh Black congressman.
A state legislator before and after his stint in Congress, Miller briefly held the seat previously represented by Smalls after successfully contesting the results of the 1888 election on the grounds that Black voters were prevented from casting ballots. A vote by Congress didn’t seat him until September 1890. He lost re-election later that year in another disputed contest.
Miller was raised by two freed slaves, Richard and Mary Ferrebee Miller. But he had fair skin and claimed both of his biological parents were white. Whether that’s true is unknown.


Where to see Clyburn talk about the book

Regardless, Miller presented himself as African American. Born in 1849, Miller moved to Charleston with his parents two years later and attended schools for free Black children. During the Civil War, he delivered newspapers between Charleston and Savannah, where he spent two weeks in a Union prison camp. He completed his education after the war, graduating from Hudson School in north of New York City and Lincoln University, still a historically Black college in Pennsylvania.
In 1872, he returned to South Carolina and earned a law degree from the then-integrated University of South Carolina before the end of Reconstruction closed it to Black students.
Like Smalls, Miller was a delegate to the mostly white 1895 convention that rewrote the state constitution. He went on to found what became South Carolina State University, Clyburn’s alma mater, and served as its first president from 1896 to 1911.
People don’t know these stories as well as they should, Clyburn said. That much is clear in how often people tell him they think he is South Carolina’s first Black representative, he said.
He also often sees misunderstandings about what it meant to be a Republican or a Democrat in his predecessors’ era, he said. All eight who came before him were Republicans.
Through telling the men’s stories, he hopes to correct the record and leave people better informed.
“I’m doing my part with this book to try to fill a gap in the education of people in South Carolina,” Clyburn said.
Clyburn continues to see echoes of the past in the news. Recently, that’s been through calls to redraw congressional maps across the country in efforts to pick up more seats for a single party, he said.
Voting lines must be redrawn after every census to account for population changes, since each U.S. House member is supposed to represent roughly the same number of people. But this year’s changes are occurring mid-way through the normal decennial process.
South Carolina has made no moves toward an interim redrawing, especially since a court fight over the state’s most recent maps ended just two months ago.
Some ultra-conservative members of the Freedom Caucus have called for redrawing the maps to potentially replace Clyburn with a Republican in the 6th District, which was gerrymandered after the 1990 census to create a majority-Black district. Clyburn has represented it ever since. But those proposals are unlikely to gain any traction.
Still, Clyburn likened the nationwide attempts to alter voting maps to the 1895 rewrite of the state constitution that ushered in the Jim Crow-era South.
In addition to South Carolina lacking a single Black congressman for nearly a century, the state Legislature had no Black representation for seven decades. In 1970, voters elected James Felder, Herbert Fielding, and I.S. Leevy Johnson to the state House. The number of Black legislators jumped to 13 four years later, after a lawsuit forced the state to redraw voting lines.
“Are we going to learn from the lessons that I tried to share in this book about what happened in 1877 (at the end of Reconstruction)?” Clyburn said. “Or are we going to sit idly by and allow history to repeat itself?”
Despite its warnings about letting history repeat itself, the book ends on a hopeful note, he said.
In the epilogue, Clyburn points to South Carolina’s less popular official motto: “prepared in mind and resources.” The saying reminds him of one of his favorite Bible verses, Hebrews 11:1: “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.”
“What that says to me is that just because you do not see success doesn’t mean you should not prepare for success,” Clyburn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Clyburn-92NY.jpg,,,2025-11-28 14:57:19.368099

The U.S. State Department confirmed the release of Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement sent to the Phoenix on Friday. “The Department of State welcomes the news […],"Screenshot of video taken of Mohammed Ibrahim on Thursday (from CAIR-Florida press release)A 16-year-old Palestinian American youth from Brevard County was released from an Israeli prison Thursday after being held since February on allegations of rock throwing in the West Bank.
The U.S. State Department confirmed the release of Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement sent to the Phoenix on Friday.
“The Department of State welcomes the news of the release of U.S. citizen Mohammed Ibrahim from detention in Israel,” said a State Department spokesperson, who added that “the Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens.”
During a press conference in Tampa in August, an attorney for his family said that Ibrahim had originally been held in Israel’s Megiddo Prison, where they said he had contracted scabies but been denied medical treatment. Family members said he had lost more than 25 pounds since his detention began.
In a press release issued Thursday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)’s Florida chapter, the organization said it had shared a sworn statement with members of Congress detailing how Ibrahim had been “beaten with rifle butts, starved, denied medical care, and threatened by masked interrogators who coerced him into a false confession under fear of further violence.”
CAIR and CAIR-Florida are calling on the State Department, members of Congress, faith leaders, and civil-society organizations to press for a full public accounting of Ibrahim’s treatment and “concrete consequences for the Israeli officials responsible.”
NPR reported earlier this month Ibrahim had been charged with two counts of stone-throwing at a moving vehicle, which could have resulted in a penalty of 20 years. A military court had been scheduled to hear his case on Dec. 15.
The Guardian reported earlier this month that the Israeli embassy in Washington had been circulating a letter in the nation’s capital defending its nine-month detention of Ibrahim and the medical treatment. The publication said the letter had not mentioned his dramatic weight loss or that his family had virtually no contact with him since he was arrested in February for allegedly throwing “rocks at vehicles belonging to Israeli citizens” or a confession after being interrogated the night of his arrest.
In October, 27 members of Congress, including Florida Democratic U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor and Maxwell Frost, sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee expressing “grave concerns” over Ibrahim’s treatment, and called on them to press the Israeli government to release him.
Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen also signed that letter.
“I was relieved to hear from his family today and to know that he’s safe and where he belongs — with his family,” Van Hollen said on X on Thursday.
The letter noted that Ibrahim was the cousin of Sayfollah Mussalet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa who was reportedly beaten to death by Israel settlers in July, with no one yet held in account regarding his killing.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0-4-1024x509.png,,,2025-11-28 14:57:19.368099

You can read more about the section here.

A few weeks ago in a conversation with a Mississippi legislator, I, as superintendent of the Oxford School District, was challenged to stop simply pushing back on school choice proposals and instead offer solutions.
The question was fair: If not school choice, then what? That challenge stayed with me, because I believe we can’t just oppose ideas. We must offer better ones. The truth is, there are smarter, more impactful choices we can make in education – choices that would transform Mississippi’s future without dismantling the public school system that serves the vast majority of our children.
As Mississippi continues to debate school choice, it’s time we ask a deeper question: What kind of choice actually creates opportunity for our children and moves our state forward?
For years, the conversation around education reform in Mississippi has centered on competition – where students go to school and which school gets the funding. But real improvement doesn’t come from competition. It comes from collaboration, consistency and a shared vision of success.

The truth is, Mississippi doesn’t need more schools to choose from. Instead, it needs more opportunities within the schools it already has.
Mississippi currently ranks among the lowest in the nation in labor-force participation, with barely half of working-age adults engaged in the workforce. It’s not that we lack jobs. It’s that too many Mississippians finish high school or even college without a clear path into meaningful work. As a result, we struggle to retain our own talent, fill high-wage jobs and sustain economic growth. 
If we want to strengthen our economy and our communities, we need to redefine what “choice” means. True educational choice shouldn’t be about choosing between public and private schools. It should be about creating more high-quality pathways within public education –  from the earliest years of a child’s life through the transition into adulthood. Instead of dividing our resources, let’s align them by investing in the full continuum of learning that starts in preschool and ends with a productive career.
The first and most transformative choice Mississippi can make is to invest in early childhood education for all families. Research consistently shows that the earliest years of life are the most critical for brain development.
During this time, children form the language, social and problem-solving skills that determine how they learn for the rest of their lives.
Yet in our state, access to high-quality early learning remains deeply unequal. Some communities are fortunate to have public or private preschool options, while others have long waiting lists or no programs at all. Many parents simply cannot afford tuition, leaving too many children behind before they even begin kindergarten. 
When children start school already behind, it can take years to close that gap. Many never do. We see this in literacy rates, in third-grade reading outcomes and later in high school graduation data. The gaps that emerge early in life become barriers to achievement, employment and self-sufficiency. The good news is that these gaps are preventable with a bold, statewide commitment to early learning. 
Universal access to early childhood education would be a game-changer for Mississippi. Children who attend strong preschool programs are more likely to read proficiently by third grade, graduate from high school and attend college or technical programs. They are also less likely to need special education services or repeat grades. The benefits ripple outward: Families gain stability, parents are more able to participate in the  workforce and communities thrive. 
High-quality early learning doesn’t just shape individual children. It strengthens the entire economy. When parents can rely on safe, affordable childcare, workforce participation increases. Businesses benefit from a more reliable labor supply.
Over time, the return on investment is remarkable. For every dollar spent on early childhood education, economists estimate a return of seven to 10 dollars in reduced costs for remediation, welfare and incarceration, and increased earnings and tax revenue. 
Imagine what it would mean for Mississippi if every 3- and 4-year-old had access to a strong early learning environment – one that emphasizes language development, curiosity and relationships with caring adults. Imagine what it would mean if every parent could go to work knowing their child was learning in a safe, enriching setting. Imagine what it would mean if kindergarten teachers welcomed classes of students who were all ready to learn, not already behind. 
The states that lead the nation in education and workforce development have already made this investment. It’s time Mississippi does the same. If we truly want to transform our schools. our economy and our future, it must start with the youngest learners.
The second critical choice Mississippi must make is to build a modern system of educational pathways that extend from high school into college, career and beyond. 
Around the world, countries that have aligned education and workforce systems are preparing students not only to graduate, but to thrive.
In one nation, nearly two-thirds of students participate in paid apprenticeships that blend classroom learning with real world experience. In another, students begin exploring careers in middle school and progress through flexible learning tracks that connect seamlessly to college or technical training. In a third, every student graduates with credentials recognized by both employers and universities, ensuring that no one’s future is limited by a single choice at age 16 or 18. 
These systems treat education as a shared responsibility between schools, employers and government. They prioritize flexibility, allowing students to shift between academic and applied learning. And they value all forms of success equally – whether a student earns a university degree, completes an apprenticeship or starts a business. 
Mississippi can design its own version of this model. Imagine a state where every student has access to three respected pathways: 
• A college-ready pathway for those pursuing four-year degrees. 
• An applied-learning pathway that combines academics with paid, hands-on work experiences leading to a certification or associate degree. 
• A direct-to-career pathway that connects students to high-wage industries like health care, advanced manufacturing or information technology. 
Each of these routes would be flexible and interconnected, allowing students to move between them as their goals evolve. Every pathway would be designed in partnership with local employers to ensure students graduate with both knowledge and experience. And every pathway would be valued equally with no stigma and no hierarchy – just options that recognize that success comes in many forms. 
This approach is already working in parts of Mississippi. Districts that have developed strong career academies or early college programs are seeing higher graduation rates, better attendance and stronger engagement. Scaling this across the state would require a coordinated effort among K-12 districts, community colleges, universities and industry, but it’s possible. In fact, it’s essential.
Both of these investments – early childhood education and career pathways – represent the smarter kind of school choice Mississippi needs. They focus not on competition but on capacity. They don’t pit schools against each other. They unite them around the shared goals of preparing every child to contribute to their community and reach their full potential. 
If Mississippi is serious about improving its economy, reducing poverty and retaining  homegrown talent, these are the choices that matter most.
Let’s choose to invest early, ensuring every child begins school ready to learn. Let’s choose to build pathways that prepare every graduate for college, career and life. Let’s choose collaboration over  competition, opportunity over ideology and a future where every Mississippi child has a path to success from cradle to career. 
That’s the kind of “school choice” worth fighting for – one that truly changes lives.

Many of the state’s fishing spots are open in the winter, though specific regulations on what can be taken when, what bait can be used and which places have seasonal closures is always something to bear in mind. 
Checking both ice conditions and Montana’s 2025-26 fishing regulations is a good idea before getting out on the ice. FWP suggests fishing during the day when fish are most active, and that people might have some luck around dams. Fish change their behavior in the winter, often moving to areas with less temperature variance. They also tend to slow down and look for areas that are more oxygenated.
“The most popular winter fly fishing rivers are typically tailwaters – those stretches below a dam,” Adam Strainer, who heads FWP’s fisheries division, said in a release.
The agency recommends never to ice fish alone, wear an extra layer under waders, consider using a wading staff and to avoid flowing water above your knees.
Ice should be at least 4 to 6 inches deep, avoid open water and keep a sharp eye out for holes left by other people. Spreading out in larger groups is also generally recommended.
Ice fishing can be dangerous, especially when it comes to burns — a 2016 National Institute of Health study found that about 38% of fishing injuries happen in January. However, the study found that thermal injuries are actually more common than hypothermia.
Alcohol was also mentioned in the study.
“Intoxication was reported twice as often in the narrative of ice-fishing injuries compared to traditional fishing injuries warranting further investigation,” the study reads.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-11.06.12-AM.png,,,2025-11-28 13:56:54.094944

The federal funding for LIHEAP, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes, has been held up during the beginning of the cold-weather season because of the federal government shutdown, which ended Nov. 12.
“This release of LIHEAP funding is essential and long overdue,” Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement. “Families can finally begin receiving the support they need to keep the heat on as winter begins.”
States typically receive their allocations at the beginning of November.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, has not yet issued a formal public announcement about resumption of the funding. After the federal shutdown ended, HHS said one of its agencies would “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” blaming the delay on congressional Democrats.
Wolfe said state agencies told his organization they’ve received award letters from HHS, enabling them to begin distributing assistance to households.
A message was left seeking comment with HHS.
On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members sent a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to release the LIHEAP funds by Nov. 30. Given the heating season has already started in many parts of the U.S., they said “there is no time to waste,” especially for households that use home heating oil or propane. Those fuels typically aren’t affected by state moratoriums on utility shutoffs during the winter months.
Roughly 68% of LIHEAP households also receive SNAP food benefits. Wolfe said delays in both programs during the shutdown “put many households in an even more precarious situation than usual.” While Friday’s funding release is welcome news, he said the need for assistance “remains enormous,” especially given rising energy prices. He noted that arrearages remain near record highs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25301782677114-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 13:56:54.094944

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Des Moines Area Community College President Rob Denson prepares to step away from the role — and the campus community he’s spent more than two decades serving — he said he’s working to make sure the college, ongoing projects and its new leaders are in the best place they can be.
After 22 years leading DMACC and more than 40 years in higher education, Denson will retire at the end of the year, with interim president Liang Chee Wee set to take over until a permanent president is found. Looking back on his career at the community college, Denson said he has no regrets.
“We’ve got a great organization. We’ve got enough facilities to handle everybody in central Iowa or be available to everybody in central Iowa. I think the operation is pretty good. We’ve got a very strong team, a leadership team that’s passionate about what they do,” Denson said. “But other than that, you know, I think I’m going to feel like I’ve done enough.”

A couple of capital projects currently in progress are still itching at him, however, namely new construction for the dental hygiene and assistance programs and industrial trade facilities. Construction crews have already broken ground on both of the projects, Denson said, but he was hoping to see at least $2 million raised by the college for both projects before he retires.
The community college foundation’s lack of an executive director has slowed fundraising, he said, and a search to fill the position didn’t see success. With Denson’s retirement coming up, he said the plan was to wait until a new president is in office to start the search up again. But with the presidential search itself delayed due to candidates withdrawing, he’s now spoken with Wee about trying to hire for the job instead of holding back.
“Since we’re not going to a permanent president probably till next June or July, we’re going to go ahead and fill that position, because I want to get that person up and running as far as raising that money,” Denson said.
In his time as president, Denson said he’s seen new technologies change the direction of higher education, from cell phones to artificial intelligence. DMACC is already offering both noncredit and credit courses in AI and related technologies, having been the first college in Iowa to partner with Intel to create curriculum and resources on the subject.
Employers Denson has spoken to in his role as president have said they’re looking for hires with skills and competency in AI tools. Denson predicted that AI training will be incorporated into “every program going forward,” whether that’s at community colleges, four-year universities or training offered directly by companies.
“I think the technology that we have and the ability to support students is really exciting, and this means that we can help them get through easier,” Denson said. “And there is so much support in Iowa.”
A more recent sign of change Denson said he’s not quite so hopeful about is the possibility of community colleges offering four-year degrees, something the association Community Colleges for Iowa explored at the prompting of Iowa lawmakers.
Community colleges already have amazing partnerships with Iowa’s four-year institutions, Denson said, and there aren’t any crises of capacity causing the need for such a shift in programming. When he worked in higher education in Florida, Denson said something similar occurred, but that was because universities simply didn’t have the room for all of the students.
“I think the Legislature is pretty smart, and I think they’ll work with the four-year institutions, and with us, and if there’s a gap there somewhere that we can fill, we’re happy to do that,” Denson said. “We do it all the time, but a blanket bachelor degree authority is probably not something that I would be excited about.”
Nearly two years after breaking the record to become DMACC’s longest-serving president, Denson’s favorite part about his job has now become the thing he will miss the most — graduation.
Seeing all of the students and families come out to celebrate such an important milestone as graduation, especially as more than one-third of DMACC students are low-income and more than half are first-generation, has been the highlight of his career, Denson said. He’ll miss the students, as well as the faculty, staff and leadership he has worked with for so long.
“Then again, you know, I’m not going to be lonely,” Denson said. “I’ve got plenty to do.”

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Detroit Lions tight end Sam LaPorta and his wife, Callie LaPorta, sent a letter earlier this month to state legislators in support of “Queenie’s Law,” a bill that seeks to ban all experimentation on dogs in Michigan public institutions. 
The bill was introduced in the state Senate by Sen. Paul Wojno (D-Warren) and in the House by Rep. Joe Aragona (R-Clinton Twp.) in March. The legislation sits in committee in both chambers, though in late October it moved out of the House Committee on Regulatory Reform to the House Committee on Rules.
“Dogs used in labs are no different than our incredible rescue pup Bonnie,” the letter from the LaPortas states, quoted in a press release circulated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
The group added that the couple is thankful that science is moving away from dog experimentation.
The letter urged House Speaker Matt Hall and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks to prioritize and advance the legislation, which is named after a dog that died after being used in experiments at Wayne State University. 
“Michigan’s dogs are lucky to have Sam and Callie on their side,” said Ryan Merkley, director of research advocacy for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which worked with the LaPortas on the letter. “Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill for painful, dead-end dog experiments.”
Other celebrities have also expressed support for the legislation, including actors Lily Tomlin and Ernie Hudson, who appeared in a TV ad in support of the bill.

Carnegie Mellon University annually attracts thousands of students from more than 150 nations with its highly ranked degree programs and abundant research opportunities. But this year, amid geopolitical tensions and tightening federal immigration policy, those numbers edged down.
Compared to last fall, there are currently 223 fewer students enrolled from China and 272 fewer students from India, for instance. That’s a dip of 7% and 15% respectively. A spokesperson for CMU acknowledged that international enrollment is “down in undergraduate and graduate programs,” but said that this decline is “smaller than that experienced by many other institutions.”

In 2020, U.S. universities experienced a steep drop in international enrollment as COVID-19 swept the globe, but numbers quickly rebounded. Now, international enrollment is facing new pressure from a changing U.S. immigration system.
Some U.S. policymakers are concerned about the perceived threat of international students, particularly Chinese students in STEM fields. And increasingly feverish language on the strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China — some of which has been heard on CMU’s campus this year — could also dent future international enrollment.
“I have international grad students who are scared and freaked out right now, and don’t feel welcome in this country,” said Carrie McDonough, a professor of chemistry at CMU.

In the 2023-2024 academic year, U.S. universities enrolled more than 1.1 million foreign students. While nationwide enrollment figures for the 2025-26 academic year are not yet available, other metrics are.
For instance, data from the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office show that 19% fewer international students entered the U.S. in August 2025 than during the same month last year. In Pennsylvania, the number of visas issued to Chinese and Indian students has dropped by 6% and 4% respectively, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) database.

Restrictions on international students could also hinder U.S. innovation, as CMU President Farnam Jahanian noted at a July AI summit on the campus. He said then that “we … need to have an immigration policy that allows us to recruit the best and the brightest to come to this country,” and pointed to data indicating that 90% of CMU’s international .”
 The China scare and visa insecurity

Contrary to Jahanian’s recommendations, many U.S. policymakers are seeking to limit international enrollment due to security and economic concerns.
On March 19, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter to CMU and five other universities urging them to curtail their enrollment of Chinese students due to a fear of espionage and the subsequent loss of U.S. technological supremacy. “As China aggressively pursues dominance in strategic industries, the unchecked enrollment of Chinese nationals in American institutions risks facilitating the technological transfers that strengthen Beijing’s military and economic competitiveness at our nation’s expense,” the letter said.
In late March, the State Department followed up by revoking hundreds of student visas across the country, sometimes without warning, claiming the recipients were suspected of taking part in “activities that are counter … to our national interest.” Then in May, visa interviews were paused for three weeks to expand the vetting process, limiting the number of foreign students who could be admitted this semester.

According to McDonough, once the U.S. government showed its willingness to swiftly revoke visas, many international students stopped voicing their political beliefs around campus. “A lot of people feel really scared about saying anything that might be construed as un-American.”
For many, a student visa is the first step toward permanent residence. Research by the National Science Foundation shows that 73% of foreign PhD recipients who study science or engineering in the U.S. remain after graduation, while, according to a separate study by the Economic Innovation Group, only 17% of bachelor’s recipients stay.
 ‘There’s really no incentive to coming here’

CMU has not been spared from visa revocations.
On April 7, Jahanian notified students and faculty that “two current CMU students and five recent graduates had lost their visa status.” The students were given no reason for the revocations, although one who came forward with their story suggested it could be related to an expunged DUI case from 2023.
Six of the seven individuals soon had their visa status restored, but the move sent a chill through the international community. In the words of a Chinese-born graduate student who spoke with Public Source but asked to remain anonymous, the message was: “America don’t welcome you, you can come here to study, but be prepared to leave sooner or later.”
For those seeking longer-term U.S. residence through a work visa, the outlook is no more promising. In September, the administration introduced a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa, likely limiting the number of foreign workers that U.S. companies are able to hire. Public Source spoke with two Chinese graduate students at CMU who expressed that their plans to work in the U.S. after graduation may be thwarted by this new fee.
“I think we are at the peace before the storm,” one said. “What is now in contention is the policy position, the idea that America is a country that welcomes foreign talent.”
Korawich Kavee, a Thailand native and PhD student in CMU’s College of Engineering said even highly ranked American schools could struggle to attract foreign students like him if the U.S. keeps to its current path.

“Basic safety concerns, how is it going to work in terms of the visa, or in general the cost of living” are likely to make the U.S. less appealing for prospective students in Asia. “People can go to Canada, people can go to the UK, people can go to Australia,” he pointed out.
This changing visa policy doesn’t pose an immediate problem for Kavee, who will return to Thailand after graduation, but it does have “a strong impact on those who are thinking of coming to the U.S.,” he said.
A decline in international students could hit CMU hard. According to a dashboard maintained by the university, roughly 40% of CMU students and 14% of faculty have been foreign born since it began collecting data in 2021. The school’s primacy in fields like computer science and AI rely heavily on its ability to attract, as Jahanian put it, the “best and brightest.”
 ‘Our war with the communist Chinese’

On July 15, CMU took center stage as host to U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit. The event brought together leaders of industry, academia and government to discuss the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence.
McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, took the opportunity to announce that $90 billion of investments will come to the state to develop AI data centers powered by natural gas. He promised that “tens of thousands of jobs” will come to Pennsylvania if the region embraces the “AI revolution.”
Many speakers, though, raised concerns about a looming AI race with China, framing it as a matter of national security.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said that “losing the AI arms race” was one of the “existential threats” facing the United States. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright compared the current situation to World War II, claiming that “AI is our second Manhattan Project.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei spoke about the ability of AI “to find the needle in a haystack, the next September 11 … The better our AI can be, the better we will be able to contend with what our adversaries are able to do.”

Throughout the discussion of threats and adversaries, China was repeatedly singled out as the primary concern.
“If the United States does not lead this revolution on our own terms we will hand control of our infrastructure, our data, our leadership and our way of life to the Chinese Communist Party,” said McCormick. Gov. Josh Shapiro echoed this sentiment. “We do not want China to beat us in the AI race.”
Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick alleged that opposition to the AI revolution based on environmental concerns may be the result of Chinese manipulation. “The number one investor in the environmental narrative is China,” he claimed. “China … is trying to get us to close a coal plant a week.”
Some speakers were even more hawkish.
Rick Perry, former secretary of energy and former governor of Texas, praised President Donald Trump for acknowledging the “war that we’re in, and our war with the communist Chinese. That’s what this is all about, don’t get confused.”
Some experts on U.S.-China relations caution against such a blanket assumption of hostility.
“I worry about the feedback loop of fear and escalation, which I think can quickly spiral out of control,” said Kyle Chan, a researcher on industrial policy for the RAND institute and a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton University, in an interview with Public Source. Chan is currently writing a book about China’s tech-industrial policy. “I think words matter here a lot.”
He expressed hope for a more productive technological competition between the two nations, particularly in the field of AI, but he points out that “uncertainty over visa and immigration policies, and targeted attacks on some of the country’s most prestigious universities have sent a chill among foreign researchers in the U.S.”

Illah Nourbakhsh, a robotics professor at CMU and executive director of the Pittsburgh-based Center for Shared Prosperity, pointed out how a political environment that fails to welcome foreign talent may also hinder innovation. “The foreign and national students in our country are all outstanding. If we fail to encourage one group to innovate here, then we lose the chance of their innovations here.”
Nourbakhsh said the current climate reminds him of the first Trump administration, when “we started seeing more and more of our excellent students think about, ‘Should I set up that startup company here? Get a job at a university here? Or should I go to Europe? Or should I go back to a developing country where I come from perhaps, where the opportunities are sparser but I know I’ll be welcome?’”

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she believes troops from West Virginia should remain in the city only on a voluntary basis.
Capito’s statement to reporters came after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard members be sent to the city in the wake of the shooting on Wednesday. About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
“I like that idea — for West Virginians to be in a voluntary status. We’ve certainly served our time over in DC,” Capito said. “… I don’t know where [Trump] is going to draw his 500 extra guardsmen from. I think West Virginia should stay on a voluntary basis, and that will be up to the governor.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration.
Trump’s order to increase military presence in D.C. came after two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot in a targeted attack blocks from the White House on Wednesday.

West Virginia National Guard member U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thursday evening, according to officials. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalized in critical condition on Friday morning, according to a news release from Morrisey’s office.
In an interview with CNN’s Sarah Sidner on Friday morning, Morrisey said he was “supportive” of keeping West Virginia National Guard members who volunteer in D.C. He did not indicate whether more troops would be sent from the state, but said he agreed with Trump’s move to bring more military into the U.S. Capital. It would be wrong, he continued, to pull the National Guard out after the recent attack.
“The last thing in the world we should do is turn around and reverse course and let the bad guys, the evil-doers win,” Morrisey said. “… We cannot turn around and give in to them. We have to send a clear message that if you’re going to mess with our troops, you’re going to pay the price.”
The suspect was shot during the incident and taken into custody. On Thursday, federal law enforcement officials searched the home of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan refugee who worked with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Lakanwal allegedly drove across the country from Washington state to D.C. to target the troops, officials said.
Lakanwal is currently facing a murder charge as well as three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. 
In the wake of the shooting, Trump and other federal officials have vowed to crackdown on immigration. On Wednesday evening, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that all applications from Afghan nationals were being put on pause.
On Friday, Capito said she was “concerned” about the immigration process and the policies that allowed Lakanwal to come to the United States.
“I mean, what kind of vetting processes do we have? Are they thorough?” Capito questioned. “… I think that this is a sad way to point out that we don’t have good and accurate information [on our different immigration processes] that we need to get. We need to get more granular. I think that’s why the President put a halt on a lot of this, so that we can evaluate our processes.”

Pictured here is a deer in Ashworth Park in Des Moines on March 10, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is seeking feedback on its 25-year wildlife action plan, which must be reviewed every 10 years per federal law. 
The action plan, according to DNR, is a strategy for how the department will conserve wildlife in the state. It was last updated and reviewed in 2015, but was initially approved in 2006. 
A draft version of the 2025 update to the plan is available for review on the DNR’s website and public comments will be accepted on the plan through Dec. 5. 
The wildlife plan includes an overview of wildlife and conservation in the state, species of greatest concern, research, conservation priorities, a cost-benefit analysis and more.

The 2025 draft chapters have updates of wildlife statistics. For example, public conservation lands accounted for 1.7% of land area in the state in 2004, 2.48% in 2015 and 2.5% this year. 
The new version also updates the species of greatest conservation need in Iowa. Subcommittees of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan working group evaluated 1,601 species and determined there were 799 species of greatest conservation need. The 2025 list included bumble bees, moths and plants that were previously not considered. 
The initial plan outlined six “vision elements,” with a goal of Iowa recognizing these visions at the end of the 25-year plan, or in 2030. 
The 2025 draft version includes “implementation highlights” of the six vision elements. Listed below are the six vision elements, followed by DNR’s interpretation of how the visions have been implemented over the past 20 years. 
The visions express hope that by 2030, Iowa will have: 
“Viable wildlife populations” that are “compatible” with modern landscapes and human tolerance. 
Inventories and monitoring programs in the state show that some species, like the Olympia marble butterfly and the starhead topminnow were spotted in Iowa after decades of absence. Some reintroduction programs for species like peregrine falcons, trumpeter swans and osprey, have been “highly successful” in the state, as have citizen scientist monitoring programs. 


Comments on the plan maybe submitted: 
via email to Katy.Fullin@dnr.iowa.gov
or by mail to Katy Fullin,
Iowa DNR, 6200 Park Ave., Ste 200, Des Moines, IA 50321.
Comments are due by Dec. 5, 2025.


“Healthy ecosystems” incorporating “diverse, native” habitats that can sustain wildlife populations.
The state has improved bird conservation areas, led stream restoration projects for freshwater mussels, “enhanced and expanded” native prairies for butterflies and mapped species of greatest conservation need.
Communities that are developed with “adaptive ecological management principles.” 
The department employs land management plans that try to “recreate prairie ecosystems” which once comprised more than 80% of Iowa’s landscape. The chapter said restoring native ecosystems for specific species is difficult with “much of the landscape being used for agriculture.” The department also works to maintain the native landscapes by controlling invasive species.  
More Iowans who participate in “wildlife-associated recreation.” 
DNR continues to expand wildlife-associated recreation opportunities by maintaining access to public land and other programming, including a recent effort to engage birding communities in the state. 
Iowans who respect wildlife and advocate for the conservation of wildlife and habitats.
DNR works to provide outdoor recreation opportunities for Iowans. Part of this includes the department’s online atlases for public and private hunting lands.
“Stable, permanent funding” for the management of wildlife, at a level “adequate to achieve the visions” laid out in the plan. 
The chapter said “funding has never been dedicated to wildlife conservation at a level adequate to achieve plan goals,” but partnerships, like the DNR license plates and the Chickadee Checkoff  have enabled some larger-scale projects. 
The 2025 draft also calls for a marketing campaign to persuade Iowans, lawmakers and other leaders to fund the plan. 
According to the cost-benefit analysis included in the plan, implementation of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan would cost about $165 million annually. This funding would allow the department to increase the amount of permanently protected acres in Iowa to 4% and continue habitat protection, management, survey and research activities.
Under that estimate, annual funding is $127 million short, according to the 2025 draft plan. 
The latest version of the plan said the original action plan, with its goal of permanent protection for 4% of Iowa’s land, required an annual rate – via conservation easements and land acquisitions – of 31,600 acres per year. The actual rate has been between 8,350 to 13,934 acres annually. If the current rate of land protection continues, the 4% goal would be achievable in 2055, but not 2030. 
The plan said the cost of land and “varied” federal funding, has impacted the state’s ability to protect land. 
2023 figures included in the 2025 draft of the plan found the outdoor recreation sector had more than $2.19 billion in wages over 46,000 jobs. Outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, target shooting and wildlife watching contributed nearly $2 billion in economic development in 2024. 
The draft plan said the “conclusion is clear” that conservation is a “solid investment for Iowa.”
“As implementation of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan continues, more benefits will be seen across the state for wildlife as well as for the people who enjoy outdoor recreation and who value wildlife and wild spaces,” the 2025 draft said.

Read this story in English.
La legislatura de Connecticut modificó recientemente las leyes que rigen la interacción de los funcionarios locales y estatales con los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE. UU. (ICE) y limita las actividades de los agentes de ICE en el estado. Las modificaciones a la ley estatal se realizaron en respuesta a las preocupaciones de los residentes sobre la política federal de inmigración. Divididos por partidos, los Demócratas estatales han trabajado para abordar las afirmaciones de los inmigrantes de que viven con miedo.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las actividades de ICE en Connecticut.
¿Qué cambios se implementaron en la última legislación estatal?
En la sesión especial de noviembre, los legisladores estatales aprobaron el Proyecto de Ley 8004 de la Cámara de Representantes, que incluye secciones que limitan la capacidad de ICE para realizar arrestos en los juzgados. El proyecto de ley prohíbe a los representantes de las autoridades policiales locales, estatales o federales arrestar a personas dentro de los juzgados estatales sin una orden judicial. Los agentes de ICE tampoco pueden usar mascarillas en los juzgados sin un requisito médico.
También existen medidas para proteger la información personal de los inmigrantes. Las agencias estatales no pueden compartir información personal como fechas y horas de audiencias y citas judiciales, domicilios particulares y lugares de trabajo.
El Gobernador Ned Lamont promulgó el proyecto de ley poco después del período extraordinario de sesiones.
¿Pueden las fuerzas del orden de Connecticut entregar inmigrantes al ICE?
En 2019, los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron la Ley de Confianza, que especificaba los motivos por los cuales los funcionarios locales y estatales podían entregar inmigrantes no autorizados al ICE. La ley prohíbe a las fuerzas del orden estatales arrestar a personas únicamente con base en órdenes de detención (solicitudes del ICE para retener a alguien hasta por 48 horas para que los agentes puedan detenerlo).
Los agentes del orden solo pueden cumplir con las órdenes de detención si el ICE cuenta con una orden judicial para realizar un arresto, o si la persona bajo su custodia ha sido condenada por un delito grave de clase A o B, o está identificada en una lista de vigilancia terrorista. Los delitos graves de clase A o B incluyen asesinato, secuestro, agresión sexual, robo y homicidio en primer grado.
La Ley de Confianza se modificó en mayo de este año. Ahora, las personas pueden demandar a las ciudades y pueblos si se viola la ley. Además, se ampliaron las circunstancias bajo las cuales las fuerzas del orden deben cumplir con las solicitudes de detención del ICE para incluir 13 delitos más y definir quiénes se consideran agentes del orden.
¿Qué sucede cuando el ICE realiza un arresto?
Si bien las leyes recientes buscaban hacer que los juzgados sean más seguros para los inmigrantes en Connecticut, los agentes del ICE aún pueden realizar arrestos en otros lugares públicos sin orden judicial si tienen una sospecha razonable de que la persona a la que se dirigen es un migrante no autorizado, según la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad.
Además, fuera de los juzgados, no existen leyes que exijan a los agentes del ICE mostrar su rostro ni que prohíban el uso de mascarillas. Esto significa que los agentes del ICE aún pueden acercarse a una persona con mascarilla y realizar un arresto sin orden judicial.
¿Cómo recomienda el estado que las agencias estatales respondan a las visitas del ICE?
En un documento de la oficina de Lamont emitido en enero, el estado proporciona orientación sobre cómo las agencias estatales deben gestionar las visitas del ICE para cumplir con las leyes estatales y federales, a la vez que protegen el derecho a la privacidad de las personas.
La guía instruye a los funcionarios estatales a solicitar información sobre el motivo de la visita del agente de ICE, notificar a un asesor legal y abstenerse de compartir información personal o documentos, como su estatus migratorio, hasta que un asesor legal revise la solicitud.
ICE también tiene acceso limitado a áreas no públicas. Tienen prohibido acceder a áreas no públicas de un edificio de una agencia estatal sin una orden judicial. Sin embargo, no existe legislación que limite sus movimientos en las instalaciones públicas de un establecimiento. Por ejemplo, un agente de ICE podría realizar un arresto injustificado en una acera fuera de la instalación estatal.

No coroner candidate crossed the 50% vote threshold to avoid a runoff. Jeramiah Howard, the current interim coroner, came close at 41% of the vote. He and Stephanie Meachum, who received 16.7% of the vote, are vying for the position. 
The winner will complete the term of Sharon Grisham-Stewart, who served as county coroner from January 1999 until December 2024. She still had a year left in her term.
In Grisham-Stewart’s final years as coroner, her office along with Jackson Police Department were scrutinized for not adequately notifying families of missing persons about their loved one’s burials at the county pauper field.
Howard and Meachum previously worked in the Hinds County Coroner’s Office under Grisham-Stewart’s leadership. She endorsed and campaigned for Howard.
The Hinds County Board of Supervisors appointed Howard as the acting coroner in January. He served as chief deputy coroner under Grisham-Stewart for five years. He also served as chief of the Pocahontas Volunteer Fire Department for 10 years.
Meachum served as office manager responsible for budgets and agency records for the coroner’s office from 2011 to 2016. She has led the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office since 2016.
On Election Day, Howard won nearly every precinct from Utica to Jackson, only losing roughly 10 precincts out of 108. He won by his widest margins in Pocahontas and other northwestern precincts located in the county. Meachum performed best in central Jackson. 
Only 12.75% of 165,069 voters turned out for Election Day in Hinds County.
Howard has signs in most precincts in the county, in front of private homes and off interstates and highways. Some went up as early as July. He estimates that his team has placed 30 big signs, 100 medium signs and over 600 yard signs across the county.
“It was a team effort,” he said. “I feel blessed to have this much support across the county.”
He also wanted to thank his nearly thirty volunteers.
“Running for office is a noble deed,” he said. “My fellow candidates ran good races and deserve credit for putting their name on the ballot and reaching people in the community.”
Meachum has been her own campaign manager since she first filed. Her team sometimes included a few friends and family. Since the runoff announcement, she has received calls from potential volunteers.
“I feel inspired to reach more voters,” she said in an interview with Mississippi Today on Oct. 5. “Some are still unsure of what the coroner does, and I’m hoping to reach them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04160529/Voting-14.jpg,,,2025-11-28 12:57:16.166568

Concern about federal duties not being carried out effectively, concern for colleagues’ wellbeing, concern about how the reduction in the federal workforce will affect the economy, and concern about jobs being cut at any moment.


From insiders to ousted
This is the final story in a series about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


About 154,000 federal employees took buyouts — officially described as deferred resignations — early this year, providing them with pay through the end of the fiscal year in exchange for leaving their position. The Trump administration made the offers as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
During the recent federal government shutdown, an estimated 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, and another 730,000 were required to work without pay.
Excluding contractors and postal workers, there are 8,123 federal civilian employees living in South Dakota. When retirees are added, South Dakota’s “federal family” is just shy of 22,000, Zimmerman said. Just under 800 belong to his organization, which advocates for members, their pay and their benefits.
“The federal employee is there to serve the American public. We are here to help you,” Zimmerman said. “We’re not the enemy. We’re not the root of the problem. We’re just trying to do our job to take care of you.”
‘We’ve lost institutional knowledge’
Zimmerman worked for decades for the U.S. State Department as a security engineer. He was paid lower than what he would have received in the private sector, but he felt his role was noble. He felt called to serve his country even into retirement.
The 68-year-old participated in the State Department’s re-employed annuitant program after he retired in 2010, which allows retired foreign service or civil service workers to temporarily fill staffing gaps or work on special projects. Zimmerman, who lives in Sturgis, would often live in a country overseas for a few months to fill critical roles.
Zimmerman retired completely in October 2024, and has since heard from former colleagues about Department of Government Efficiency cuts. A Trump executive order in February directed agency heads to “separate from Federal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject” to reductions in force.
A drastic reduction in the workforce means there aren’t enough people to do necessary work, which requires cutting back programs, Zimmerman said. He thinks cutting back the State Department’s re-employed annuitant program makes the problem worse and will jeopardize national security.
“I’ve seen programs cut that I don’t think they’ve thought through the impact of those cuts,” Zimmerman said.
It’ll take years and significant costs to build back the federal government, even to verify and reanalyze the need of programs, let alone hire people back, Zimmerman said. Many federal jobs require a specialized skillset.
“We’ve lost institutional knowledge,” Zimmerman said, “and that costs a lot of money and time to rebuild it back to where we need it to be.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-11-28 16:28:46+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Judges’ ruling offers warning to public bodies about excluding the public,Terrence T. McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/28/judges-ruling-public-bodies/,Public bodies too often use exemptions in the Open Public Meetings Act to exclude the public from matters that concern them.,"The Monroe Township Board of Education meets on Oct. 15, 2025. The board was sued over its decision to appoint a new member before holding a public discussion.A panel of appellate judges this week shined a spotlight on the all-too-common issue of government bodies in New Jersey hashing out decisions behind closed doors.
If you’ve ever watched a public meeting, you know what I’m talking about. Officials tell the public they have legal matters to discuss, so they meet privately, sometimes for hours. The state Open Public Meetings Act allows them to do this, with limits, but any reporter or gadfly will tell you they suspect a lot more goes on during these private sessions than the law allows.
The appellate decision from this week involves the Monroe Township Board of Education, which met on Oct. 18, 2023, in part to fill a vacant seat on the nine-member board. It met in closed session for 45 minutes to discuss the candidates, reached a consensus pick while meeting privately, then returned to public session to appoint a guy named Matthew Gorham, without giving the public a chance to weigh in before their vote to add him to the board. That was a violation of the Open Public Meetings Act, the appellate court ruled.
“Substantively, the public only witnessed the nomination and vote to install Gorham. The Board did not take any questions or comments from the public about the candidates or the process because it moved directly to the nomination and vote,” this week’s ruling says.
Making matters worse, the board had previously told the public they’d be interviewing candidates at the meeting, then decided not to.
The Open Public Meetings Act certainly gives the Monroe school board the legal right to discuss potential appointments to a vacant seat outside of public view. But the law also requires them to bring that discussion back before the public before acting, as the new ruling says.
“The fact (that) all its deliberations regarding candidate qualifications and whether to interview those candidates took place in private, without giving the public any insight into these decisions, was problematic,” it says.
Walter Luers, who represented the plaintiff in her lawsuit against the Monroe board, said he’s pleased the appellate panel issued an “important rule of law” stating that school boards, when appointing a new member, must explain the decisions they make behind closed doors to the public.
“This is an important rule for transparency and Board governance in New Jersey, and is consistent with existing New Jersey caselaw,” Luers said.
The fight over the Monroe school board appointment is largely moot — Gorham lost in his bid to stay in the seat in April 2024 — but I hope other public entities take note here. State law governs when you can and can’t meet in private, and simply saying “we’ve got legal matters to discuss” isn’t a good enough reason to shut the public out of matters of public concern. Luers agrees. 
“I hope it moves the needle closer to public entities having more disclosures and discussions in public, and certainly when appointing an official that ordinarily the electorate votes for, a higher standard applies,” Luers said.

Free.,National Guard shooting suspect to face murder charge,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-guard-shooting-suspect-face-murder-charge,,"The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia announced Friday it has charged the man who allegedly shot two National Guard members earlier this week with first-degree murder after one of the soldiers died as a result of her injuries. Other charges include three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. The attack shocked the country and has led to a renewed discussion about immigration policy as well as the war in Afghanistan and how the country withdrew during the Biden administration. President Donald Trump announced late Thursday night he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” though he didn’t specify which countries would be included or exactly how such an order would be implemented. Trump wrote on social media he plans to ""remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.""The post came just hours after U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from injuries she sustained during a Wednesday shooting a couple of blocks from the White House. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalized in critical condition. Both were West Virginia National Guard members.The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who worked with United States forces, entered the country on Sept. 8, 2021, as part of Operation Allies Welcome, according to a statement from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.No details of immigration proposalsThe White House press office declined to say Friday which countries would have their residents barred from entering the United States under the new order, referring back to the president’s social media posts, which did not include a list.“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!”Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a Thursday afternoon statement the administration would pause immigration applications for Afghan nationals.“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” she wrote. The Trump administration will also review “all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration,” McLaughlin said, saying those cases required more vetting. Biden Afghanistan policy blamedIn a separate post, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden for allowing the alleged shooter into the country. McLaughlin echoed that sentiment.Lakanwal “was paroled in by the Biden Administration. After that, Biden signed into law that parole program, and then entered into the 2023 Ahmed Court Settlement, which bound (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) to adjudicate his asylum claim on an expedited basis.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Paul Lasley’s hobby of restoring old and broken violins and donating them to Iowa State University’s instrument collection program didn’t start with a violin of his own, or really any other stringed instrument — it started with a tin clarinet.
When the retired ISU sociology professor was growing up in Queen City, Mo., he wanted to join his elementary school band. Lasley said his family couldn’t afford a new, black-painted wood clarinet, so he had to borrow an older, metal instrument from the school.
Now he’s working to make sure students who hope to find belonging and opportunity through music like he did have better equipment than was available to him, through finding and fixing fiddles and giving them to an instrument drive run by Iowa State Center’s Stephens Auditorium staff.

“We’re enculturating the value of helping others, and that’s what we really should be about …,” Lasley said. “I was loaned a tin clarinet, and while I really would like to have had a better instrument, I had the opportunity.”
Instrument drive puts music in the hands of area students
Lasley has donated 15 violins to the instrument drive so far, he said, and he has more he’s currently repairing to donate. While he originally planned to be an anonymous gifter to the instrument cart that sits in the lobby of the auditorium ticket office, Lasley said his wife took a sneaky picture and posted it online.
The retired professor’s face would be recognizable to many on campus, as he worked at the university for 40 years. His creation of the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll provided a way to track agriculture and farm life, and how changes in these areas affect farmers and rural society, according to the poll’s website.
Lorna Carroll, outreach coordinator for Stephens Auditorium, and other staff got wind of Lasley’s identity and reached out to him. While Lasley said his first thought after answering Carroll’s call was “Uh-oh, what might I have done,” Carroll assured him they just wanted to connect with the generous donor.
What started as seasonal instrument drives in the winter and spring have turned into a year-round practice, Carroll said. Donations of working and non-working instruments — except pianos — may be dropped off at the collection cart when the ticket office is open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.
Since the drive’s start in 2023, Carroll said 113 instruments have been donated, with Lasley having donated the most. The instruments go to area school bands and orchestras, where they are loaned to students.
“It’s super expensive to buy an instrument, and even to rent one,” Carroll said. “It’s out of reach for a lot of families, and so the school districts do what they can to provide what they can, repair what they can, but what a gift that (Lasley has) given.”
Making fiddles sing again
Lasley said he only repairs beginner and intermediate-level fiddles, as high-level instruments should be taken to professional repair workers.
“I am the equivalent of a shade tree mechanic with automobiles,” Lasley said. “I’m not a luthier, I’m a shade tree violin fixer upper.”

Violins are found in shops, flea markets and on Facebook Marketplace, and even in pieces they can be useful. An electric violin Lasley said he was unable to fix hangs as an art piece on his office/workshop door and instruments both in need of repair and all fixed up are on the walls, a bucket of old bows in the corner and cases not fit for use set against the wall.
Lasley buys new bows and cases for the instruments before they’re donated, he said, so students can have new materials that can take the beating often provided by young musicians.
Each violin has its own work that needs to be done, Lasley said, and no two violins are the same. They each have their own history, told through the dings and etchings on the wood that Lasley said he keeps if they have a particular meaning, like the “DMPS,” standing for Des Moines Public Schools, he found on a fiddle he’s already donated.
Lasley said his hobby was born from woodworking, a lifelong hobby he spent more time on after retiring. There are only so many pieces of furniture friends and family can accept before there isn’t any room for more, he said.

One violin he’s yet to start on has come apart, with the top completely separate from the back and evidence of previous repairs that need to be fixed. Lasley said he’ll start the project by scratching off old glue, patching cracks and gluing the top plate back on. Once the front has been reattached, Lasley will insert a soundpost that, once restrung, will be held in place by 55 pounds of pressure.
Before he restrings it, however, Lasley said he’ll have to shape a bridge and attach it to the face of the violin to hold the strings.
“You end up doing everything while eyeballing and measuring, and then I get frustrated. That’s when I come over here and practice,” Lasley said, gesturing to another corner of his office where a music stand is set up, sheet music laid out.
Playing on
Lasley started playing violin when he was 69 years old. Now 73, the retired professor said he mainly learns by listening to recordings of his teacher playing over and over until he’s got the tune in his head and can sing it out on the strings. He emphasized that while he — and his teacher — can both read sheet music, this is his preferred learning style.
Holding the violin owned by his great-grandfather, who died in 1922, Lasley wondered if the melodies he plays on it were made more than a century ago on the same instrument, 30 years before he was born.

Lasley was lucky, he said, to have grown up with music constantly in the background — guitar from his father, upright bass from his mother and a reed pump organ he remembers playing at 4 years old with his grandmother, who had to push the pedals since his feet couldn’t reach.
In addition to playing the clarinet, Lasley said he played the bass clarinet and saxophone in school and played upright bass in his own band for years.
As he continues to search for fiddles to make sing once again, with the goal of getting them in students’ hands, Lasley said he hopes they help to instill values of paying kindness and generosity forward.
“It’s about helping the next generation,” he said.

She lost her job in a restructure done by the national organization. (Screen capture of Child Welfare System Oversight Committee)TOPEKA — A national organization supporting social workers restructured, stripping Kansas of its local executive director and leaving a long-time system advocate without a job.
Becky Fast, who has led the Kansas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers since 2017, was let go from her position when NASW announced internally two weeks ago that it was combining 14 state chapters into pairs that would be overseen by one director.
Kansas now is paired with Iowa, said LaToya Evans, NASW spokeswoman.  
Fast was stunned by the decision to restructure the NASW’s entire system and said it was not discussed or voted on by member states or representatives. The decision was made at the executive committee level.
“The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is undergoing a national, internal realignment to strengthen operational efficiency and support for social workers,” Evans said in an email. “As costs within nonprofit organizations continue to increase, it has become necessary to continue transitioning to a dual-chapter executive director model in states that have fewer members or were supported by part-time employees.”
Fast, who is also a Johnson County commissioner, worked 30 hours per week as executive director, she said. 
Organization dues in Kansas pay for the local chapter costs, including her salary, so financial considerations are not the full reason for the restructuring, Fast said. In a letter announcing the new structure, the national board said “appropriate steps were taken to ensure that we adhered to our financial, legal, and ethical duties.”
Evans said Kansas and Iowa will each maintain a leadership council and chapter identities. The new model has been tested in some states, providing full-time employee support between neighboring chapters and maintaining local engagement and collaboration, she said.
Across the country, social workers and state NASW leaders took to social media to complain about the decision. In some states, including Arkansas and Kentucky, entire boards running state chapters resigned at once in disagreement with the national association’s decisions.
The Kansas NASW chapter board wrote a letter expressing its anger at how the restructuring decisions were made, citing the lack of clear communication, one of the bedrock principles of social work, as leaving board members and volunteers “confused and frustrated.”
“As the Kansas Chapter President, I have not been informed about the rationale, process, or decision-making steps leading to the elimination of our Kansas Director,” Kansas board president Tonya Ricklefs wrote in a letter signed by all board members.
The letter listed accomplishments Fast made as a state leader, including moving the organization out of a financial deficit and organizing one of the largest “advocacy day” efforts in the NASW organization. On social media, one upset Kansan pointed to Fast’s recent testimony in front of a Kansas legislative committee addressing questions about workforce issues.
“Frustrations have arisen from the lack of communication about realignment plans, no publication of approval of major changes, lack of opportunity for board and executive director input, and lack of understanding of how this cost savings will be allocated and how NASW will be structured to support our local advocacy efforts,” Ricklefs’ letter said.
Fast, the Kansas board of directors and others worry that eliminating the local chapter will weaken statewide advocacy efforts, particularly at a time when social workers are needed to support many industries.
“I’m not only sad that I’ve lost my job,” Fast said. “I’m sad for the social work community, the social workers, because it’s taken me years to build up (legislative) relationships.”
The lack of direct Kansas leadership raised such concerns that advocates have called a virtual meeting on Dec. 6 to discuss whether there is a way to create “a new Kansas social work organizational structure with the first priority being legislative advocacy,” one Facebook post said.
Fast said she’s worked with numerous Kansas legislators to educate them about social work, and the result is relationships built on trust so that government officials will call and ask for presentations and information.
The power of relationships was brought home to Fast recently when she filled in for her Oklahoma counterpart who was on sick leave. As she tried to work through issues, Fast said, she struggled with who to contact and even finding social workers in the state willing to testify. In Kansas, she has helped social workers become confident and willing to share their stories.
Fast said each state’s licensing laws are different and it’s important that the person speaking for Kansas social workers understands the nuances of the laws, particularly in a time when the Trump administration has proposed removing social workers from a list of professional degrees.
Melinda Lewis, a University of Kansas professor and director of the Center for Community Engagement and Collaboration, said the loss of someone with Fast’s knowledge of Kansas-specific challenges is significant.
“I do think the Kansas chapter of NASW with Becky’s leadership has made great strides in helping policymakers — not just legislators but state agencies and local leaders who pay attention to what’s happening in the Legislature — understand what social work does for Kansans,” Lewis said.
“We are in a different and a much more promising place now than we were several years ago, and (Kansas NASW) and Becky Fast aren’t the sole reason those advances have been made but they have been significant in it,” she added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Becky-Fast-11-25-screen-capture-1024x536.png,,,2025-11-28 11:57:32.391845

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The State Library of Ohio got some good news as a federal agency from which they receive grant money won a battle in federal court against an executive order from President Donald Trump.
Last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island blocked Trump’s order that would have dismantled the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
The institute is the sole source of federal funding for libraries, according to Ohio’s State Librarian Mandy Knapp.
The State Library of Ohio receives funds through the institute’s Library Services and Technology Act for training, administration of grant programs, and to support sharing resources through a consortium for “significant cost-savings for taxpayers.”
“In our state, we use these funds to enhance summer reading so that our children don’t lag behind academically, to conserve our culture heritage to make sure that future generations will be able to share in our collective past, as well as to implement the latest research such as the Science of Reading in our libraries,” Knapp said in a statement.
The state librarian previously told the Capital Journal the loss of the federal funding would “totally and utterly devastate” the agency.

The most recent grants distributed by the state library from the $5.4 million received from the institute went to programs including monthly story times for the deaf, technology for use with historical records, and digital materials for the home-bound.
In addition, the Toledo Lucas County Public Library received a grant to support the Science of Reading, and 18 rural libraries received money for public technology training.
The struck-down executive order was issued March 14, ordering the elimination of the agency all together.
After the order, the Trump administration removed the board of the institute, terminated grants from the agency and planned mass layoffs.
The American Library Association said the actions left the institute “unable to fulfill its duties required by federal law and interrupted library services across the country.”
“Convincing a federal judge that shuttering a supposedly obscure agency would have an immediate and devastating impact on millions of Americans is no small feat,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, after the order was struck down.
“Libraries also strengthen local economies by supporting jobseekers, small businesses and community learning.”
While the State Library of Ohio sees the court win as a positive sign, they are still struggling due to cuts the state made in its most recent operating budget.
While previous state budgets have had separate line items for the State Library of Ohio, in the most recent state operating budget, the method of distributing state funds for the agency is through a transfer from the Public Library Fund, a fund that previously was earmarked for local public libraries outside of the state agency.
The Public Library Fund is tasked with providing funds for the State Library of Ohio, the Library for the Blind, the Ohio Public Library Information Network, the Regional Library Systems Fund, and the Ohioana Library Association, according to budget documents.
The state funds the Public Library Fund using shares of the monthly General Revenue Fund tax receipts, to the tune of 1.75% of the revenue.
In the next two fiscal years, the state library is set to receive $4.5 million in each year.
State Librarian Knapp said when the changes were announced in budget drafts that the number amounts to a cut of $245,000 in 2026 and $331,000 in 2027 compared to previous drafts of the budget.
The cuts also came as Knapp laid out the situation at the state library, where staff and health insurance costs rose, and the library facility was “no longer suitable to house the State Library’s collection.”
The library holds historical documents like the state’s founding documents as part of their conservation role with the state.
A spokesperson from the state library said the entity has “evaluated the services (it) provides and determined where we should focus our resources.”
As a result, the library has had to cut some services like information technology support in meeting rooms, and left an Information Services & Technology Department position open after it was recently vacated.
The library plans to monitor the federal case in case it’s appealed to a higher court, and the upcoming federal budget resolution, which is set to expire on Jan. 30, 2026.

The private university announced its Learning Institute for Fulfillment and Engagement, or LIFE, program will offer both synchronous and asynchronous online options for students starting in the spring.
Designed for adults ages 23 and older with at least three years of work experience, the LIFE program runs five-week courses throughout the year in Dubuque and Cedar Rapids. According to a news release, students can earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business, human resources, accounting, marketing, criminal justice and health care through the program.

“Adult learners are balancing careers, families, and community commitments and they deserve an education model that works for them,” said Lee Noethe, senior director of LIFE admission – Dubuque, in the release. “The new LIFE HyFlex format empowers our students to take control of their education and advance their careers with the same quality, rigor, and personal attention UD is known for.”
Classrooms at both the Dubuque and Cedar Rapids locations are being updated to provide the best experience for students no matter their method of learning, the release stated, with the addition of cameras, microphones and other technology. This work is already complete in two Dubuque classrooms and one Cedar Rapids space.
“The upgraded program and lower tuition combine UD’s hallmark personal touch with the latest in educational technology,” Noethe said in the release. “We’ve created a model that meets students where they are, supports them every step of the way, and opens the door to meaningful credentials and careers.”

Ned Houston wore many hats during his 37 years on staff at Sterling College, from president of the tiny Craftsbury Common college to what he called, “lowly faculty member.”
Ned Houston and his wife, Susan, a former Craftsbury Selectboard member for 18 years, have lived in the small Northeast Kingdom town for decades. They’ve seen first hand the economic and cultural benefits that the environmentally focused school has had on Craftsbury since its founding in 1958.
The school, one of the smallest four-year colleges in the country, once attracted students from around the country to Craftsbury, a collection of small villages that includes Craftsbury Common.

Here, students and faculty did significant work, heading out to conduct field work in the Himalayas, and resource management projects along the Colorado River, not to mention their work in Vermont itself.
The college has helped define the economic and cultural life of the community, made up of born-and-raised Vermonters mixed with alums of the school who decided to stick around. The college, community members say, played a part in bucking Vermont’s longer-term demographic trends when, in the 2020 census, it saw its population actually increase.
“I think, despite our location in a very rural area, we gave quite a lot of world exposure to students, and to ourselves,” Ned Houston said.
But this month, after 65 years of operation, the school announced it would be ending its academic programming following the upcoming spring semester. College officials said the school faced persistent financial and enrollment challenges.
The news has spurred plenty of worry in the town of roughly 1,300. What does a future in Craftsbury without Sterling College look like?
“We had been a relative success story,” said Gina Campoli, a Craftsbury Common resident. “And now we’re getting hammered.”
The closure has also reinforced anxiety around the future of higher education in Vermont. Sterling College is just the latest in a string of transitions and closures at small colleges in Vermont and in New England.
More than a half dozen colleges in Vermont, including Green Mountain College in Poultney, the College of St. Joseph in Rutland and Goddard College in Plainfield, have shuttered after facing similar challenges around finances and enrollment.

“Sterling has always seemed to have this unique niche of people and has been able to survive some challenges in the past,” Campoli said. “And to have this reality hit us now, it’s very sad.”
Cultural impact
Emily McClure first purchased The Genny, Craftsbury’s local general store, with two other business partners in 2012. In the years after, McClure said Sterling College students have been a routine presence at the store — as customers, employees and community members.
Those students have for years had an indelible influence on the culture of the town, she said.
“There’s this young energy that comes with a college in your town,” McClure said. Craftsbury Common would not be what it is, she said, without Sterling College having been there for nearly 70 years.
Having a college in town brings academics and thinkers into the community to speak at events and “adds a great deal to I think that just the general depth of discussions of things here in the college,” Ned Houston said. The college has also served as a major employer for the region. 
Alums, too, are a big part of the community’s social fabric. Susan Houston said many graduates become ingrained in the community and settle down, working in the area, having children and sending them to the local K-12 public school, Craftsbury Academy.
“I think that that has really helped boost our population,” she said.
But McClure said the town and college’s populations have decreased since the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of students who remain in the community after they graduate has also dwindled, she said.

“It really has been this kind of slow decline in the presence of the college over the last five or so years,” she said. “Whereas I feel like, when I first got here, it just felt like it had a bigger presence.”
The college is set to officially shut its doors in the summer. “I’m sure we’re going to feel it, but I think we’re going to feel it more in an energetic way than we are financially,” McClure said.
Susan Houston, too, fretted over the longer-term impacts of the college’s closure, particularly on the population of alums.
“We won’t have new alums living in our community anymore, and that just makes me really tragically sad because I’ve so enjoyed knowing these students as anxious and excited 18-year-olds, and now they’re in their 30s and in their 40s, and I loved having them as community friends,” she said. “I think we’re going to really miss that.”

Water woes
The town’s civic infrastructure also could take a big hit when Sterling College closes.
Paula Davidson, the treasurer of the Craftsbury Fire District #2, a volunteer body that manages the local water system in Craftsbury Common, said the college has been key to the water district’s operations since the body was founded in 1983. The district serves residential homes, a church, libraries and the Craftsbury Academy.
Kestrel Owens, a commissioner of the water district, said the college’s closure will “have a major impact on our budget in terms of what sort of income we have to run the water system.”
The college has historically been the district’s largest customer, representing 45% of the district’s water usage and 36% of district’s customer income, Davidson said.
The district maintains water connection for Craftsbury Academy, which represents 12% of its income and serves approximately 180 students. The district also operates 40 other metered connections in Craftsbury Common, serving roughly 68 residents.

Without the college, “I’m not sure how we will proceed,” she said.
Davidson said the district expects to begin charging more in the coming years to build capital reserves. “We also hope to find grants and loans to help us afford the looming infrastructure repairs and replacements,” she said.
But she said the district “will be anxiously watching to see what happens with the Sterling College buildings.”
What happens next is unclear. Sterling College President Scott Thomas previously said the focus now is getting the remaining students through their last semester.
Thomas said the college’s board of trustees will determine how to steward the college’s remaining resources.
“I don’t know what’s next, but there will be resources remaining,” he said earlier this month. “We do have a very clear mission, and we do have a fantastic board, so we’ll see what happens at that point.”
Ned and Susan Houston said there are many ideas floating around about what to do with the Sterling College campus and its properties.
“I’m hoping that there will be a group of people who will convene community members and whoever, alums and whoever,” Susan Houston said, “so we can together creatively help design what the future will be, because most of us really need to keep some of the whole vision of the college alive and well through whatever the next reiteration is.”

(Photo by Dale Hogg for Kansas Reflector)BARTON COUNTY — The problem sounds easy: Kansas has too few houses for sale, especially in small, rural communities struggling to attract young people and new businesses.
The simple answer is to build more houses.
But those in real estate say this shortage has been years in the making, and it may take years and creative thinking to emerge from it.
“We’ve been under-building for decades,” said Mark Tomb, vice president of governmental affairs for the Kansas Association of Realtors. “We’re just not building enough homes.”
If all goes as planned, efforts in Barton County may offer a blueprint. The county commission has tapped economic development funds and other resources to help housing developments in three communities.
“If we were to announce one housing development in one city, it would be a big deal,” Commissioner Shawn Hutchinson said. “In this case, we are announcing three different and unique housing developments in three different communities, potentially totaling over 40 new homes in Barton County.”
Hutchinson credited the projects to “exceptional collaboration with community partners.”
“Without growth, we are dying on the vine,” Hutchinson said, stressing the need for central Kansas to innovate. “No one is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves.”
Hoisington, Ellinwood and Claflin are the three communities undertaking projects.
“Housing is a major challenge for our region, impacting our county’s ability to grow and hindering business development, retention and growth,” said Jonathan Mitchell, city manager of Hoisington. “Local governments need to find ways to work with private individuals and organizations to help encourage and facilitate growth.”
Mitchell is “spot on,” said Bekah Selby-Leach, director of the Wichita State University Center for Economic Development and Business Research.
“The smaller markets are just being ignored by developers,” she said.
With a youth exodus and an aging population, she said, these areas don’t make sense for risky speculative construction.

The projects
On Oct. 14, Barton County commissioners approved allocating up to $125,000 in economic development dollars to help a new $600,000-plus development in Hoisington. The project will add 12 new homes to the community of 2,600.
The Hoisington funding will reimburse the city for installing essential infrastructure: curb, gutter and a new concrete street in the new northern subdivision.
Mitchell detailed the city’s significant investment. The city purchased the former Windgate Apartment property, demolished structures, addressed environmental concerns and prepared the grounds. The city has already spent more than $549,000 on the project, with sanitary sewer extensions bringing the total city investment to nearly $691,000.
Hoisington requested the county’s financial aid to expedite construction. The goal is to begin by year’s end or early 2026.
Meanwhile, east of Great Bend, the city of Ellinwood is in the final stretch of a development “about three years in the making,” said city administrator Chris Komarek. The two-square-block Northwest Addition on the community’s northern fringe will house up to 14 new homes in the city of 2,000.
“The county had a pretty significant role in the purchase of the materials,” he said.
The county contributed $200,000 for infrastructure supplies — like sewer and water pipes — for the new Ellinwood District Hospital and the new development. The city has invested about $300,000 so far.
Komarek’s city council approved the sale of the first two lots on Oct. 13, and buyers are interested in two more by year’s end.
“We’ve had quite a bit of interest over the past three years,” he said, noting it waned as the project dragged on and interest rates climbed.
“But, once we get the streets in up there, it will start to look more like a housing addition,” he said.
Water, sewer and communications infrastructure are already in place. Streets should be completed within the month, followed by gas lines.
“We should be done by the end of the year” with all prep work, Komarek said.
Then, home building will begin.
“By the spring, it will be exciting to see,” he said.
In the northeast corner of the county, the Hidden Hills Development sits just outside Claflin’s northern city limits. Developed by the Miller family, owners of Millers of Claflin furniture store, the project includes 16 lots between three and five acres each.
“We hear it every day in the store,” said Brad Miller of comments about the lack of housing in the town of 543 residents. “We got tired of hearing about it and decided to do something.”
He said 12 lots have already been sold. One home is under construction, and two more should break ground after the first of the year.
Even though the Millers bought the land, Miller said, it took community support. The site falls in the Independent Township, which helped surface the roads, and Barton County provided culverts.
“The township and the county have been wonderful to work with,” he said.
City water will serve the area, but homes will use individual septic systems. Natural gas and electric infrastructures are being installed now.
Since the development is in Claflin’s one-mile extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, it required the city to sign off on the plat. The county commission also had to authorize the layout plan.
The initiative has been in the works for almost two years, Miller said. The Millers originally asked Claflin to annex the site, but city officials decided that taking over the property was too much of a financial burden.
Driven by growth at the nearby ONEOK gas plant and hospitals in neighboring Hoisington and Ellinwood, the area is seeing an influx of young families filling the schools, which has exacerbated the housing shortage.
“We’re happy with this. It’ll be good for the area, and it will be good for the city of Claflin,” Miller said.
 
A new normal
Maranda DeSanto, CEO of the Kansas Association of Realtors, said year-to-date, Kansas has seen 36,790 new listings.
The month’s supply of inventory — a measure of how long it would take to sell all properties at the current pace — was up 4% from a year ago but remains low at 2.6 months. A balanced market traditionally holds four to six months of supply.
But DeSanto said the concept of a balanced market is likely changing.
“We haven’t seen those numbers for about 10 years, so I think we have to agree there’s a new normal to the market,” she said.
The Kansas housing market saw higher prices and persistent low inventory in September. The median sales price for a home rose to $269,000 in September, a jump from $255,000 in September 2024 and $248,000 in September 2023.
DeSanto said the pricing trend is a direct result of the long-term shortage.
“With the basics of supply and demand, this is also a conversation about sales price,” DeSanto said. “While there are always homes for sale, tighter inventory will generally show up in the pricing.”
It’s not just a shortage of houses, Selby-Leach said. It’s also the price points. Fewer lower-priced homes, often starter homes, are being built, while more high-end homes go up. Even homes being built in urban and metro areas are priced out of reach for many buyers.
While mortgage rates seem high, Tomb said, they are hovering near the long-term norm.
Tomb also referred to the 2021 Kansas Statewide Housing Needs Assessment, the state’s first comprehensive housing study in nearly 30 years. It noted that to keep pace with need, 3,800 to 5,000 new homes must be built annually — which is not happening.
The assessment revealed several key challenges: a pervasive shortage of quality, affordable housing for middle-income families; specific housing needs for the state’s aging population; and depressed housing values in many rural areas, hindering investment.
A final key challenge was a severe labor shortage in the building trades, complicating new construction and rehabilitation.
The assessment launched several initiatives in the 2022 legislative session, including the Moderate Income Housing program and the Rural Housing Incentive District program.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Barton-County-housing-Ellinwood-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-28 09:59:58.302022

One of the incidents involves a caregiver who mistakenly dispensed the wrong drugs for a resident, and a nurse who then concealed the full scope of the error from the resident’s treating physicians.
That incident took place at Northgate Care Center in Waukon, which has been fined $10,000 by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing for failing to properly assess and treat the resident, who subsequently died.

According to state inspectors, the staff at Northgate mistakenly gave the woman medications intended for another resident — including melatonin to encourage sleep, an antidepressant, an antianxiety medication and an anticoagulant.
Video surveillance footage recorded a short time later showed the resident sitting in a recliner, standing up and immediately falling to the floor. The inspectors’ written description of the footage of the woman’s fall is not entirely clear, with some words apparently missing, but it reads as follows:
7:31:52 – 7:32:04 — The resident stood from her, tripped over her catheter tubing, fell on her left side and hit her head on the recliner all the while Staff A, Licensed Practical Nurse, and Staff B, Certified Nursing Assistant/Certified Medication Aide stood at the nurse’s station.
7:31:59 — Staff A remained at the nurse’s station while Staff B walked around the front of the station with her head positioned down as she looked at an item in her and walked down the north hallway. The resident in site.
7:32:08 — The resident stood from the reclined electric chair.
7:32:13 – 7:32:23 — Staff A casually walked to the resident positioned on the floor and held out her hand towards the resident.
Inspectors say the staff walked the resident to the dining room without first assessing the woman’s injuries. At 9:21 p.m., after the woman complained of pain, an ambulance crew arrived and took her to a hospital where an X-ray indicated she’d sustained a broken leg.
According to inspectors, the resident’s family chose to forgo surgical intervention, which led to hospice care and, at some unspecified point over the next few days, the resident’s death.
According to the inspectors’ report, Staff A, the licensed practical nurse, admitted that after the resident was taken to the hospital, she called the emergency room to report the resident had been given only one incorrect medication — not four — shortly before the fall.
“When asked why she had not told the truth in the beginning, Staff A responded by stating, ‘Because I knew I was wrong,’” the inspectors’ report states.
Other deaths trigger $500 fines
The other recent care-facility deaths that have resulted in state fines are:
REM Iowa in Coralville: This care facility has been fined $500 for failing to provide adequate supervision for a 30-year-old male resident of the home who was diagnosed with a severe intellectual disability and autism.
According to state inspectors, the staff at the home found the man unresponsive in his bed at about 6:55 a.m. on June 30, 2025. He was pronounced dead at 7:35 a.m., with the death certificate listing the cause of death as natural causes related to complications associated with epilepsy.
State inspectors allege the home failed to have checked on the man at least once every 30 minutes, but that he had not been checked after receiving his morning medication at 6:18 a.m.
Harmony House Health Center in Waterloo: This facility has been fined $500 for failing to coordinate and integrate necessary supports for a 29-year-old male resident with severe intellectual disabilities, autism and a history of eating non-food items.
State inspection reports indicate the man was found on the floor of the facility at 5:55 a.m. on Oct. 5, 2025, and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Inspectors reported the medical examiner’s office indicated the man had two gloves in his stomach and one lodged in his trachea that blocked his airway, as well as a subdural hematoma sustained in a fall.
Inspectors alleged that despite the man’s documented history of eating cloth, paper, gloves, bugs, towels and virtually anything he found on the floor, the home was unable to produce a behavioral assessment that spoke to the man’s habit of ingesting non-food items.

Since its founding in 2015, the center has offered free and low-cost legal services to more than 25,000 immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the Detroit area.
One of those new initiatives is a year-end donation drive, aiming to bring in $250,000 in donations by the end of the year to expand free and low-cost legal services for immigrants and refugees across Southeast Michigan.
The center is also inviting business and community partners to join in its mission of expanding access to justice through collaborative initiatives, which the center uses to expand its legal services.
It is also working on volunteer engagement, with the center continuing to invite attorneys, legal students, translators and researchers to support their goal of ensuring immigrants are welcomed into their communities and that justice does not depend on how much money someone has.
“Each person who walks through our doors carries dreams and challenges,” the center’s Executive Director Kevin Piecuch said in a news release. “To have served 25,000 clients since 2015 means 25,000 steps toward justice, safety and belonging. We’re proud of what has been accomplished – but even more excited about what’s ahead.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-28 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,The duck hunters in the ‘poor line’ pay into wetland conservation,"Héctor Alejandro Arzate, Mississippi Ag & Water Desk",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/duck-hunters-pay-into-wetland-conservation/,"The Mississippi River is one of the major rrivers that flow along a key route for migratory birds., known as the Mississippi Flyway,.","COLUMBIA, Mo. — Flocks arrived by the dozens in the dark before sunrise. Some travelled in groups. Others flew solo. They all wanted to land in a wetland, but these specimens needed to wait for the Missouri Department of Conservation to get all their ducks in a row. The MDC and a small bingo cage would decide who got a spot.
No, this was not a crowd of mallards. It was hunters waiting for a shot at migrating waterfowl. 
Throughout the state, duck hunting is permitted at 14 public wetlands but daily reservations are required. Half the spots get awarded through an online lottery before and during the season. The rest are for the “poor line.” Historically, this queue is for people who don’t have access to private land or didn’t score a public reservation.
On a November morning 30 hunters were at Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area near Columbia, Missouri. 
“You get up at four in the morning for a chance to get a spot at one of Missouri’s conservation areas,” Jake Rice said.
There were nine spots available for the drawing. An MDC biologist spun the cage for the hunters, who each got a ball. The lower the number, the better the odds.
The cradle of migrating waterfowl in North America
Eagle Bluffs is located in an alluvial plain of the Missouri River, and over 280 migratory bird species visit the 4,429-acre area each year.
As MDC’s resource supervisor for the region, John George said one of the main goals of the conservation area is to provide birds with a place where they can rest and find food – small acorns from oak trees, seeds, insects and even crops like rice, soybeans, and corn – for the long journey. “They can’t just fly the whole length of the Missouri and hope that they find something at the other end,” George said.
The Missouri is one of the major rivers, along with the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, that flow along a key route for migratory birds. Known as the Mississippi Flyway, about half of all North American species utilize the corridor to get from as far as Canada all the way down to Central and South America, and then back. 
“The Mississippi Flyway is definitely the cradle of migrating waterfowl in North America,” said Jared Mott, who grew up hunting in the state of Mississippi and now serves as conservation director of the Isaak Walton League of America, a national conservation organization.
The region is ideal for duck hunters, too. For the 2024 season, there were an estimated 1.3 million active duck and geese hunters throughout the United States, according to a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service report from August. Of that number, about 40 percent of the U.S. total were in the Mississippi Flyway, which includes 14 states from Minnesota to Louisiana. All together, they harvested approximately 6.4 million ducks and 1.4 million geese.
“It’s got the most ducks, it’s got the most hunters,” Mott said. “When it comes to waterfowl, you just about can’t overstate the importance of wetlands and the habitat that they provide.”
Waterfowl need the habitat not just for migrating south in the winter but also as their breeding grounds in the Prairie Pothole region — which consists of states like Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. It’s nicknamed the “Duck Factory” because it produces millions of birds each year. 
The success of duck populations – and hunting – is largely dependent on habitat quality and quantity. Both are at risk. Mississippi has 24 wildlife management areas throughout the state that are managed for waterfowl.
More than 130,000 acres of wetlands in the Mississippi River Basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, according to a 2024 report from the USFWS. This has largely been caused by drainage and fill from farming over the past century, along with modern land development and climate change.
In Mississippi, between 1930 and 1973 approximately 8, 170 acres of coastal marshes were filled for industrial and residential uses, according to a  1999 Mississippi’s Coastal Wetlands report from the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Coastal Preserves Program. 
While many migrating waterfowl have access to state and federally managed wetlands, they also depend on private land throughout the U.S. Yet, in late November, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new guidelines redefining which streams and wetlands qualify for federal regulations under the Clean Water Act. 
The proposal was praised by EPA administrator Lee Zeldin and some agriculture groups, but environmental groups have already raised concerns about the potential impact on the Mississippi River basin’s wetlands. 
“It’s not pretty,” Mott said. 
The rule is open to public comments until January 5, 2026.
The first conservationists in America
Historically, duck hunters played a crucial role in conservation throughout the U.S. They were among some of the first to advocate for the protection for all migratory birds, not just waterfowl, which resulted in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
Today, duck hunters pay into conservation by purchasing state and federal hunting permits. That includes the Federal Duck Stamp, which has raised more than $1 billion to protect approximately 6 million acres of wetlands since 1934. It’s also a popular art contest with hundreds of entries each year. 
“Without those duck hunters, there’d be a lot less habitat out there for waterfowl,” said Jake Spears, the region biologist in Arkansas for Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit for waterfowl and habitat conservation.
A federal tax on the sale of handguns, as well as other firearms and ammunition, generates funding for wildlife restoration each year — approximately $989 million for fiscal year 2024. Additionally, every state has its own way of sourcing conservation funding. For example, in Missouri,  0.125% of the state’s 4.225% sales tax collects funds for state conservation programs.
Eagle Bluffs, where the hunters waited in the poor line for a chance to shoot a duck, is just one example of what that money can do. It’s a restored wetland constructed in the 1990s to fight the loss of nearly 90 percent of Missouri’s wetlands due to agriculture and development. By recycling waste water from a nearby treatment facility, along with river pumps, the area’s wetlands have returned as 17 shallow pools. 
It’s not just duck hunters who benefit from wetland conservation. Tim Eisele, in Madison, is both a duck hunter and one of 96 million bird watching hobbyists in the U.S. 
“I happen to hunt the Mississippi River in the western edge of Wisconsin, and to me, that’s God’s country,” said Eisele. “Just being over there and watching birds move around in the morning or evening.”
“Were it not for the waterfowl hunter that wanted to go out in the marsh with his dog and his shotgun and try to shoot a couple of ducks, we would not have those habitats there available to every Missouri resident,” said Garrett Trentham, the head of the southern region’s events team for Delta Waterfowl, a nonprofit conservation organization.
It’s not even about killing ducks
By five in the morning, most of the hunters in the poor line had left. Those with a spot for the day were probably throwing out their duck decoys. The unlucky likely retreated to their beds. But Jack Honey and a friend remained — despite drawing the second-highest number with ball 16. 
“I’m glad they do this,” Honey said. “Even though you won’t get to hunt one day, but it’s for the benefit of the entire waterfowl.”
Like all good hunters, though, Honey waited patiently. And it paid off with the final spot: a blue hole called Buck Pool. Not the most desirable location to shoot ducks, Honey said, but “you can’t kill ‘em on the couch.”
The pair headed out to a flooded grain field with their waders and shotguns. They waited eagerly for the legal shooting light. All around them, the sounds of geese, coots, green-winged teals, mallards, gadwalls, and even songbirds signalled a new day. 
After a morning hunting, they went home empty-handed, but to Honey, it wasn’t even about killing ducks. 
It was about seeing how nature works. “Seeing how God presented it,” he said.

The recent retirements of Nancy Pelosi and other longtime House Democrats have led to more calls for aging members to pass the torch. Incumbents argue their experience is crucial as the executive branch is upending the balance of power in Washington. 


California’s battleground House districts might get the lion’s share of national attention for their role in deciding which party rules Congress’s lower chamber. 
But in a handful of California’s deep blue districts, an intra-party battle over the future of the Democratic Party is brewing in the wake of grim losses during last year’s presidential race.
In Sacramento, Napa County and Los Angeles, three younger challengers are arguing that Democrats need to give voters fresh faces with bold new ideas to energize the party’s base, rather than aging incumbents who are entrenched more in Washington insider culture than in their districts.
“Status quo politics isn’t going to protect our communities,” said Sacramento City Councilmember Mai Vang, 40, who is running against 10-term Rep. Doris Matsui, 81. “We need leaders who can meet the moment. And that’s why I decided to step into the ring.”
Vang is the first formidable primary challenge that Matsui has faced in the two decades since the congresswoman won her late husband’s seat in 2005. Former Rep. Bob Matsui held that seat for 26 years prior.
Two other senior California congressional Democrats have also attracted primary challengers. Rep. Mike Thompson, 74, of Napa County, a Vietnam veteran vying for his 15th term, faces a challenge from Eric Jones, 34, a former San Francisco venture capitalist. 
And farther south, former Obama and Biden White House climate aide Jake Levine, 41, is challenging Rep. Brad Sherman, 71, of Los Angeles, who is seeking his 16th term. All three challengers have vowed not to take corporate PAC money as their incumbent opponents do.
Around California and across the country, younger challengers argue that Democratic incumbents in safe districts take their seats for granted since they so rarely receive serious challenges. That false sense of security, Vang said, results in out-of-touch members who have fewer incentives to show up in their districts and talk to voters.
Part of meeting the current moment, Vang argues, means taking “bold and courageous” positions on important issues, such as speaking out forcefully against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.
Vang said she wants Matsui to more strongly condemn immigration raids that have torn Sacramento families apart and violated residents’ due process rights. She was disappointed that Matsui’s denunciations centered around the unsanitary conditions of the John E. Moss federal building, where advocates said detainees were being held without access to proper hygiene, rather than on the separation of families and indiscriminate detentions.
“For the past several months we’ve had neighbors, people in our community that have been kidnapped by ICE, taken by ICE, and Doris hasn’t spoken up against that at all,” Vang said. “And especially as someone who was born in the internment camps, I would think she would be on the front lines to speak out on the issues.”
Matsui was born in the Poston War Relocation Center internment camp in Arizona, where her parents were incarcerated during World War II.

“That’s nonsense,” said Roger Salazar, a campaign spokesperson for Matsui, noting local news coverage of Matsui’s statement against an immigration raid on a South Sacramento Home Depot and her attempt to access an ICE detention facility. “She needs to watch the news.” 
Matsui in October hosted a rare in-person forum only after constituents spent months calling on her to meet with them. Angry Sacramentans also hosted an empty-chair town hall in March to highlight Matsui’s absence, not even two weeks after House Democrats did a nationwide blitz of showing up in Republican districts to prove a similar point.
Some senior leaders are sticking around
Calls for generational change within the Democratic Party, while not new, have increased significantly as the party works to find its footing after 2024. The dynamic played out first in internal House leadership races earlier this year, where younger members like Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach leapfrogged more senior colleagues to lead powerful committees. 
Rep. Thompson, Matsui’s congressional counterpart in neighboring Napa County, said his constituents have stopped him in public and asked him to run again. 
“I can’t tell you how many times I had people tell me, ‘I sure hope you’re gonna stick around. We need you more now than ever,’” Thompson told CalMatters. “No one’s asked me to retire. No one has suggested that I’ve been there too long. And everyone knows that not only am I capable, but I’m in good shape.”
In Sacramento, Vang, the eldest of 16 children whose Hmong parents came to the United States as refugees, said she has the utmost respect for the Matsuis and their long history of service. 
Still, she has called on Matsui to follow the examples of House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi — who announced last month that she would retire next year and not seek reelection to a 21st term in Congress — and Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York, who told The New York Times that “now is the right moment to step aside and allow a new generation of leaders to step forward.”
But Matsui remains steadfast that she has much more work to do in Congress, such as overseeing groundbreaking for Sacramento’s new I Street bridge and securing federal funds for flood prevention and wildfire recovery, and said she will stay in the race. She emphasized that the deep relationships she’s built over 20 years in Washington are critical to her ability to deliver on those projects. 
“It’s important to not only have advocates, but have people who understand that once you’re in Congress, you have to learn how to govern, too,” Matsui said. “We cannot just throw everything out and start over again.”
As for Vang’s intra-party primary challenge, Matsui said anyone is “perfectly free” to run against her at any time. “I’m fine with that. This is our democracy. This is America.”
But she insisted that her record would reinforce to voters how hard she works.
“I show up every single day working for Sacramento,” Matsui said, “whether it’s in Sacramento or in D.C.”
The risk of Dem-on-Dem challenges 
One risk of primarying veteran members of Congress is the loss of institutional wisdom, said Gale Kaufman, a Sacramento-based Democratic strategist, particularly with the Trump administration testing the limits of the law and boundaries of power. 
“Especially when you’re up against stuff like this, which we’re not familiar with, breaking every norm you could possibly imagine,” Kaufman said, “having some of those people around is not a bad thing.”
Even among younger Democrats, there’s not wide consensus that incumbents are out and young challengers are automatically in. Evan Cragin, president of the Sacramento County Young Democrats, echoed Kaufman’s point that a blanket policy of “vote out all incumbents over a certain age” could be counterproductive. 
While the Young Democrats have yet to endorse anyone in the congressional races, Cragin said he is personally conflicted about who to support.
“I don’t know who I’m going to vote for,” Cragin said. “It’s nice to have a strong member at the moment, but also, there is part of me that wants to make sure we support our younger members. And Councilmember Mai Vang is a very strong challenger. She’s very community oriented.”
Those who support intra-Democratic challenges argue that they drive important dialogue and force candidates to clearly articulate their ideas and earn voters’ trust, rather than taking their support as a given. Incumbent Democrats across the country could benefit from primary challenges as the party soul searches, said Alex Niles, vice president of political affairs for the Sacramento County Young Democrats.
“We need to have a reckoning and figure out, ‘What does it mean to be a Democrat? What do we stand for? What do people want and who are we serving?’” Niles said.
“The circular firing squad in blue districts hurts our ability to win swing districts.”U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman of Los Angeles
Unsurprisingly, many incumbents and political strategists disagree, denouncing intra-party primaries as expensive distractions that deplete safe members’ fundraising that could otherwise support colleagues in more vulnerable districts.
“The circular firing squad in blue districts hurts our ability to win swing districts,” Rep. Sherman told CalMatters in an interview. 
Candidates in safe districts often support their more vulnerable colleagues to gain clout within the party, whether through direct transfers of campaign cash or by urging their donors to channel their contributions to more contested races. Sherman argues that a competitive intra-Democratic primary forces a safe incumbent to invest more in their own reelection rather than helping flip battleground seats. He repeatedly mentioned tight races in Iowa and Ohio that he views as critical to Democrats reclaiming the House. 
“What happens in swing seats may determine whether America’s a democracy,” Sherman said. “Democrats have got to win seats in Iowa, and we can’t do it unless the strong Democrats in Bel Air and Brentwood and Malibu are focused on Iowa.

“It’s hard to get people in Brentwood to focus on Iowa if there’s a real race in Brentwood.”
He added that while it matters which Democrat represents California’s 32nd Congressional District, the Los Angeles-area seat that he’s represented for almost 30 years, it’s “not life or death for our democracy.”
Sherman’s challenger Levine, who outraised the congressmember last quarter and appears to be the frontrunner in a crowded field, agrees that Democrats need to flip GOP-held seats to reclaim control of the House. But at the same time, if their party wants to retain the majority and win back disaffected voters, Democrats need to prove they’re focused on lowering the cost of living and improving their quality of life, in addition to preserving democracy. 
After leaving Los Angeles to pursue a climate policy career in Washington, D.C., Levine moved back home earlier this year to help his mother after she lost her house — his childhood home — in the devastating Palisades Fire. He was frustrated by the disjointed local and state response to recovery, and he had hoped Sherman would step up and coordinate the response. 
“The things that people want to hear about, and the things that I’m trying to talk about, are the issues in the district,” he said. “Those issues really are not about the composition of the House. They’re not about Washington inside-the-beltway questions of power.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A Georgia nonprofit has become more active in environmental battles around the state, from battles over access to air and water to challenging permissive utility regulations that contribute to high energy costs.
Since opening an office in Birmingham 15 years ago, the Southern Environmental Law Center has partnered with other nonprofits and organizations in legal battles in the public and private sectors.
D.J. Gerken, the president and executive director of SELC, said in an interview that climate change was one motivator for their work.
“We are at the beginning of a climate crisis, and the South has a big hand in causing it,” he said. “Right now, we are paying more for electricity because we are subsidizing fossil fuels. We think that is terrible for families. We know it is terrible for the environment, so we have got a lot of attention on that problem.”

SELC lends legal and advocacy expertise to other organizations and nonprofits and assists them with advancing their mission to protect the environment.
“The reality is that we have so many partner groups in this state with different interests, different cases that they want us to work on, that we do the work from partner groups that come to us that really need to be done,” said Barry Brock, director of the Alabama Office for the Southern Environmental Law Center.
SELC partnered with renewable energy advocacy organizations Energy Alabama and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution to challenge decisions made by the state’s utility regulator, the Alabama Public Service Commission, that typically rules in favor of Alabama Power.
Recently, SELC challenged a request made by Alabama Power to purchase a natural gas power generating station in Billingsley in Autauga County, which would have led to increased utility rates to pay for the acquisition. Alabama Power said the plant would help it meet increased power demand from data centers. The utility said in a filing with the PSC that the Billingsley power plant is the most cost-effective plan for addressing increased energy use.
SELC sought to stop the purchase, arguing the company did not consider other sources, such as renewable energy, to address the demand, and also  overestimated the amount of electricity that data centers will consume. Alabama Power said in a filing last week it wants to delay the implementation of the rate increase.
SELC is also challenging the process that the PSC uses to decide the rate that Alabama Power can charge its customers for the cost of fuel it buys to generate electricity.
“The way they have been doing that is through this secretive procedure where they don’t have a public hearing,” Brock said. “They don’t invite public input.” The rate ECR can be adjusted as often as every month when Alabama Power makes a request to the utility regulator. The Public Service Commission then issues consent orders to adjust the rate.
SELC is also taking on cases that deal with pollution, particularly for residents living in rural areas.

(Getty Images)Total holiday spending in Nevada is forecast to be higher this year than last year, but spending per person will likely decline, while seasonal hiring nationally will fall to its lowest level in 15 years, holiday economic forecasters say.
At an estimated $6.5 billion, total holiday spending by Nevadans is projected to be 4% larger than in 2024, the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) said in a forecast this week.
That’s in line with a national increase of between 3.7% and 4.2% forecast by the National Retail Federation (NRF).
Both fall short of last year, when national holiday spending grew by 4.3%. 
“Consumers are navigating a complex landscape” in which “inflation, elevated interest rates, and a reliance on credit are all factors contributing to a more discerning shopper this season,” RAN said in a press release.
“While spending will increase in absolute dollars, consumers are prioritizing value, seeking deals, and managing their budgets strategically,” RAN said.
In October, a report for NRF estimated consumers nationally would spend an average of $890.49 per person this year, down 1.3% from last year’s $901.99
A consumer survey performed by Deloitte Insights indicates a much sharper holiday spending decline of 10% from 2024.
Some analysts are predicting a “K shaped” shopping season, where the spending line representing more affluent consumers goes up, and the line for less well-off consumers goes down.
However, Deloitte found spending would decrease among all income groups surveyed, including those with incomes of more than $200,000.
Slow to no hiring
Holiday hiring is also expected to decline this year compared to 2024. “Following a summer of subdued hiring,” said a forecast on seasonal hiring issued in late September from the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm, Challenger “expects seasonal retail hiring in 2025 to fall to its lowest point since the recession-hit season of 2009.”
“Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s senior vice president. “While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less.”
NRF’s national forecast released this month was similarly downbeat on seasonal hiring. There were 442,000 seasonal hires in 2024. But NRF’s forecast expects retailers to hire “between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, in line with a slower-paced labor market,” the lowest amount of seasonal hiring in 15 years. 
“Because of the ongoing tariff situation, retailers will be closely monitoring spending patterns and waiting to make staff additions should demand strengthen throughout the holiday season,” said NRF economist Mark Matthews.
RAN’s forecast did not include Nevada-specific seasonal hiring projections.
Souring sentiment
In another indicator of holiday economic activity released this week, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index indicates consumers are entering the season with sour outlooks for business and labor market conditions.
The index fell 7 points in November to 88.7 (1985=100), the lowest score since April, when Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs and launched a global trade war that shocked markets and consumer sentiment. The plunge in April was the lowest the index had been since 2021.
Consumers are “notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,” said Dana Peterson, the Conference Board’s chief economist, in a statement accompanying the index’s release. “Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings,” Peterson added.
But the Conference Board’s release also noted that while consumers’ write-in responses “continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics,” there were also “increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” suggesting that could also be contributing to tumbling consumer sentiment. 
Also this week, the Census Bureau released revised estimates for U.S. retail sales which, adjusted for seasonal variations, were effectively flat in September (up 0.1% from August) — before the government was shutdown.
Deloitte’s “holiday spending confidence index” was even less encouraging than the Conference Board’s. More than three-fourths (77%) of consumers surveyed expected prices to be higher, and 57% expect the economy to get weaker in 2026, “the least optimistic outlook since Deloitte started tracking economic sentiment in 1997.”
Nevada retailers have strived to adapt to “the new economic normal,” said Retail Associaion of Nevada President Bryan Wachter in a release.
“They are offering compelling value, innovating their business models, and working tirelessly to meet the consumer where they are, both online and in-store.”
“This season won’t be without its challenges, but our members are prepared to deliver a successful and competitive holiday shopping experience,” Wachter said. 
Matthews, the NRF’s president, offered a similarly glass-half-full assessment.
“The economy has continued to show surprising resilience in a year marked by trade uncertainty and persistent inflation,” he said. “As tariffs have induced an uptick in consumer prices, retailers have tried to hold the line on prices given the uncertainty about trade policies.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1450312824-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Data center operator DartPoints plans to up the capacity of its Greenville center by 400%.
But unlike the super centers popping up around the Palmetto State, each gobbling upwards of 100 megawatts of power, DartPoints’ growth is on a much smaller scale — 12.5 megawatts, up from a 2.5-megawatt starting point.
The company pledged this month to invest $125 million in the expansion of its Greenville location, adding 88,000 square feet to the facility.
At the heart of the company’s expansion: artificial intelligence.
DartPoints’ customers are now demanding three times the capacity and computing power compared to just a year or so ago, CEO Scott Willis told the SC Daily Gazette.
“AI potentially has the opportunity to change their business in a very dramatic way. We’ve got to come along with that,” he said.
Companies are turning to AI bots to run customer care chats. Robots in manufacturing are becoming more autonomous. And from a health care perspective, hospital systems are offering more computer-heavy remote services, with wearable devices that track vitals like heart rate and blood sugar, Willis said.
So expanding is essential, he said, if DartPoints wants its centers to remain relevant over the next five years.
“It is no longer a ‘nice to have.’ It’s a requirement, on our part, to understand that change, anticipate that change,” Willis said.
More than a decade in SC
DartPoints has operated data centers in South Carolina for more than a decade. With locations in Columbia, Spartanburg and Charleston, as well as Greenville, the state is the Dallas-headquartered company’s largest market.
To finance its expansion in South Carolina, as well as in Ohio and Indiana, DartPoints secured a $250 million investment from a pair of partners earlier this year.
“South Carolina is a great business environment,” Willis said. “It’s a great state, positioned within the Southeast. It’s growing massively in terms of attracting businesses, and we want to participate in that.”
But consumer groups and politicians have pushed back against the proliferation of data centers over the past couple years. Most of that ire is aimed at so-called hyperscale centers, owned and operated by tech giants such as Google and Meta.
Meta invests in SC solar as utilities expect more clean energy-conscious firms to finance projects

These windowless centers, which house rows of servers, are among the largest drivers of growing power needs in the state, generating vast demand for electricity on top of the needs of an ever-growing manufacturing and population base.
Willis is quick to point out not all data centers are the same.
For starters, he said, utilities already have the kind of capacity on their system that DartPoints requires.
“We are a non-invasive partner inside the state,” Willis said. “We don’t disrupt the demand of the grid. We’re not asking Duke (Energy) or other utilities to invest a significant amount of money that could result in price increases for the overall citizens of the state of South Carolina.”
A different kind of customer
DartPoints also tends to serve customers that require a bit more privacy and control over their IT systems.
The company specializes in private, dedicated servers that its customers can access remotely, with guarantees that the computing power will always be available for that customer’s use. Turning to Google or Microsoft or Amazon Web Services, businesses share space on those companies’ servers, using what’s known as a public cloud system, Willis said.
If a DartPoints customer wants even more control, they can choose to have their own servers caged within a DartPoints facility that only that company’s employees have access to. DartPoints simply supplies the space and power it takes to operate and cool the equipment.
Before DartPoints moved into the state, Willis said, companies had to turn to major providers in big cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte or Nashville or major computing hubs in northern Virginia, for these serices.
Now, companies have a local option that often comes at a lower cost because they don’t have to lay down lines of fiber to get connected to a distant center. The computing speeds are also faster because companies don’t have to wait for their data to travel longer distances over the network, a major bonus as more are turning to artificial intelligence.
In all, DartPoints has about 300 customers that use its four South Carolina data centers, Willis told legislators last September. Those companies collectively generate $60 billion in revenue within the state and employ about 140,000 people.
DartPoints’ customer base mirrors the state’s major economic sectors — manufacturing, health care, some financial institutions and state and local government, as well as higher education.
“DartPoints’ growth in Greenville shows how innovation and infrastructure investment go hand in hand,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “This project reinforces South Carolina’s position as a destination for technology-driven business and demonstrates how our state can support advanced digital operations with the power, talent and collaboration they require to thrive.”
Construction is underway and the additional space is expected to be operational in July 2027.
The company does not publicize how many people it employs in South Carolina but pledged 10 new jobs as part of the expansion.
After Greenville, Willis said, DartPoints will turn its attention to growing its Columbia center, located within the South Carolina Research Authority Innovation Center. Details on that expansion are forthcoming, he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Screenshot)Rural counties in New Mexico have scant news coverage of their communities, and Native American and Spanish-speaking residents have few options in their languages. These are just two of the takeaways from a recent in depth analysis of the state’s news ecosystem, published alongside an  interactive local news map.
The study’s results did not surprise New Mexico Local News Fund Executive Director Rashaad Mahmood, who commissioned the work. The impetus came from the growing national philanthropic interest in supporting local journalism, and the concomitant need for more data to help funders understand local needs. LNF runs a variety of fundraising and training programs across the state.
While national studies in recent years have taken the measure of local news systems, Mahmood wanted a report that would analyze New Mexico at a more granular level, and specifically highlighted Colorado’s News Mapping Project at the outset as a model.
“It was kind of a no-brainer,” Mahmood told Source NM. “If we want to help more people in New Mexico have access to high quality local news information, we need to understand in more detail: Where are the communities that don’t have that, and where are the strengths? And then do some analysis of what are opportunities for our work and for other funders and people to make a difference.”

Gwyneth Doland, a professor of practice in the University of New Mexico’s Communications and Journalism Department, and retired UNM Professor Michael V. Marcotte, who now runs MVM Consulting, co-lead the research behind the more than 150-page study.
The work included a detailed survey sent to news outlets statewide; the creation of a database of 139 outlets (including Source NM); and a content analysis of the strength and effectiveness of each outlet—all data that can be accessed through the map. Doland and Marcotte also surveyed more than 1,100 New Mexico residents about their news habits; conducted focus groups around the state to complement the survey data; and conducted one-on-one interviews with media representatives to “fill in gaps and add context to our data,” a news release announcing the study noted.
The research revealed that close to half of the state’s news outlets are based in Albuquerque/Rio Rancho; Santa Fe; Los Cruces; and Farmington, leaving smaller communities with fewer sources for news and information. Moreover, four counties have no news outlets at all. The state’s digital divide also impacts residents’ news options.
But the work also revealed new initiatives and a fundamental desire among residents to stay informed and connected to their communities.
Marcotte traces the genesis of the recent report back nearly a decade to work he undertook for the national foundation Democracy Fund in assessing New Mexico’s news landscape. Doland also worked on that report.
“We basically just interviewed news leaders and editors around the state to put together kind of a little more of an impressionistic report about what’s happening in local news in New Mexico,” Marcotte, who was the lead author on that study, said. “We called it the precarious local news ecosystem of New Mexico, and that preceded funding for [the Local News Fund] and a lot of the activity that has followed that.”
The growing philanthropic interest in local news, he noted, helped grow the need for “a more sophisticated look at what’s happening on the ground.”
But the seeds of the current landscape—the news deserts and the loss of smaller communities’ newspapers—stretches back farther, Doland said.
“I think we’re on this train of disruption in the media landscape that really accelerated in the early 2000s with the internet all of a sudden becoming the place where things that used to happen in newspapers started happening online,” she said.
That “digital disruption,” Doland continued, “precipitated the loss of news organizations across the country,” including the loss of newspapers. “And that process of newspapers closing their doors makes people freak out,” she said, “because we know that high quality local news correlates directly with civic health.”
That’s why numerous philanthropic organizations and other groups have become increasingly focused on local news, she said. “They want to help,” she said. “They want to improve communities.”
While the study affirmed what its authors already knew about the areas of news deserts across the state, lost newspapers and shrinking television coverage, it also revealed emergent new community media efforts.
“Doing this research was good for us to learn about some of the great things that are out there,” Doland, “some of the new, fun, cool things where there is energy and innovation and creativity happening.” One example she cited is the Cloud Croft Reader, a newsletter whose creators, she said, recently completed the LNF news accelerator training program. “Now they’re growing,” she noted. “They’re doing great work down there.”
Which is not to say that all media endeavors made the cut for the New Mexico News Map and accompanying database.
Retired UNM journalism Professor Michael Marcotte, president and owner of MVM Consulting, says an analysis of New Mexico’s news ecosystem nearly a decade ago laid some of the foundation for a more recent study. (Courtesy photo)
“We kind of set a bar for local news,” Marcotte said. “Are you actually doing local news, or are you just saying words that people confuse as news. Do you have a journalist working there? Are you reporting it? Do you have an ethical code? We made this sort of fine-tuned distinction between what I’m just going to call noise versus news.” As a result, an original list of 360 outlets was whittled down to 139, he said.
Ultimately, the report highlights what’s lacking in the state’s news ecosystem, but also provides actionable recommendations for addressing them. Those include expanding funding for small, rural and tribal news outlets, but also improving broadband access across the state, strengthening training programs and diversifying revenue streams, to name a few.
“One of the primary users of this report, we hope, is the general public,” Marcotte said. “We think the general public should be well informed of what local news is, who’s doing it, where is it happening…and the best we can hope is [for people to] support local journalism.”
But given all the different interest groups: news creators, consumers and funders, Doland said another important recommendation lies in the need for ongoing collaboration.
“One of New Mexico’s great positives and opportunities and successes so far is this level of collaboration between the university and the industry; between the non-profits and the for-profits …between the Local News Fund and the community foundations,” Doland said. “All of this is really good connection so far, and we encourage people to build on that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newsmap-920x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-28 07:57:51.337645

Jones was semiretired and looking for a way to leverage their property for additional income. One night, they decided to dive into farming mushrooms. After a few late-night online purchases, Root 54 Farm was up and running.
They made some mistakes along the way. But with the help of a now-defunded program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they spend almost 15 hours a week traveling to various farmers markets and selling to other buyers in Sedalia, Joplin and Springfield.
“Owning a business is overwhelming,” Jones said. “Farming is overwhelming. When the two come together, it’s super overwhelming. So we are really grateful to people who help.”
The Heartland Regional Food Business Center was a part of a Biden administration program aimed at increasing the resilience of local food systems following the COVID-19 pandemic. The program aimed to help small and midsized farms with things like market access and technical assistance to help them grow and maintain their businesses.
But under Trump administration budget cuts, USDA terminated the program.
Now, its leaders are figuring out how to move forward under a new moniker — the Heartland Regional Food Business Coalition — and without the millions of dollars in federal funding once used to support their work.
The program reimbursed farmers for big purchases and helped make connections between farmers and potential buyers. Jones and Munro were never selected for monetary support, but the connections they made helped their business take off.
“We met a lot of the people we needed to meet,” Jones said.
 What’s next for the regional food business centers? 

Heartland was one of a handful regional food business centers established by the USDA. It officially launched in 2023 to help farmers across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and some Arkansas counties.
The group was slated to get $25 million in funding over four years. But it only made one round of grants to farmers before the rest of the funding was rescinded this summer.
In the only round of grant funding under USDA, Heartland provided nearly $4 million in financial assistance to 90 farmers after receiving nearly 500 applications from across the region.
Heartland was preparing for the second round of Business Builder grants — nearly $9 million in funding — and expected over 1,000 farmers to apply. Instead, it got word that federal funds may be pulled.
The group and its farmers ended up waiting six months to see if that money would actually be paid out.
One farmer was a sunflower producer who was looking for funds to upgrade his packaging process.
“He was ready and poised to expand his market this year,” said Katie Nixon, who currently shepherds the coalition through New Growth, a rural community development corporation in El Dorado Springs, Missouri.
Because the funding comes as reimbursements, farmers had to make the upgrades before they could see any of the money.
“You’re paralyzed — you’ve gotten this grant and they say, ‘If you spend the money, you’re not going to get reimbursed,’” Nixon said. “So do you say, ‘Well forget it, I’m just going to go my own way and lose $50,000, or do you wait?’”
Along with programs like Local Food for Schools, which was also eliminated earlier this year, the federal initiative was part of a larger effort to promote local food systems across the country.
“They took the conditions of the region and really focused to amplify that to provide an unmet demand from the rest of the nation,” said Hannah Quigley, a policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. “They were investing in scaling very regional specialized products.”
Support from the regional centers across the country resulted in more than 2,600 new partnerships between farmers and buyers, a June 2024 USDA brief said.
The June data also showed the program taking off. Farmers were starting to report improved processing, distribution, storage and aggregation of regional food products as a result of the support from their regional centers under the initiative.
Part of the reason for the success is because the money was there to actually keep people involved in the conversation. There are so many demands on small farmers, Nixon said. Without the possibility of some financial support, it can be difficult to prioritize where to spend your time.
“This just helped (relationships) become stronger and more formalized, because you had money to help keep people at the table,” Nixon said.
“We know that a lot of food and farm businesses came to us for technical assistance because they saw the Business Builder opportunity,” Nixon said. “So having that funding to be able to offer really gets people motivated.”
Only a small portion of federal farm support goes to producers of specialty crops, which includes produce like fruits and vegetables or nursery crops, Quigley said.
In the 1970s, the U.S. was a net exporter of those specialty crops. By the mid-1990s, it became a net importer. Still, in 2020 speciality crops contributed nearly $54 billion to U.S. agriculture’s $363 billion in cash receipts, USDA data from 2022 show.
“We have plenty of land and the way that our food system is organized right now, with commodity crops — most of those are grown specifically to send somewhere else to export,” Nixon said. “What if even just a sliver of that energy was actually to domesticate real food products?”
For smaller farmers, having dedicated support for funding and market access could make a huge difference in their success.
Heartland hosts monthly new farmer calls and connects farmers with established mentors to help them grow their specialty crop.
“They were connecting these farmers who might not have immediately known how to get connected to a distributor,” Quigley said. “I think a farmer could figure it out, but it might take them two full years, potentially three different growing seasons … to figure it out.”
From July 2023 to June 2024, the centers nationwide formalized more than 250 partnerships for their farmers. In the last six months of 2024, they finalized 466.
They were trying to reach the farmers who traditionally don’t receive USDA loans, Nixon said.
Nixon and her colleagues are looking for sources to make up for some of the lost USDA funding. But what exactly that will mean is still unclear.
“Local food is not easy,” Nixon said. “We’re trying to make it easier.”
 How to build out a regional food system 

Part of the difficulty in building up more regional food systems comes from connecting farmers to wholesale buyers who need large quantities of produce.
That was some of what the regional centers were aiming to address.
“In some cases, they connected small farmers to an aggregator, or someone who brokered purchases, then they were able to aggregate them, buy from all these small farmers and then sell to a single buyer,” Quigley said.
That structure could help incentivize larger purchasers like food banks, states or school districts to buy more local food.
Because of the control wholesale grocery suppliers have over those markets, it can be more difficult for businesses to stray away from what has become the mainstream model for buying food.
Quigley pointed to agreements the USDA has with states that let states take a more hands-on approach to local food purchasing.
“That brings those contracts down from a national scale or a 12-state scale, down to a single-state scale,” Quigley said. “It allows for a greater number of farmers and businesses to be able to successfully bid on those contracts. They don’t have to have a distribution network to serve 12 states, they can just serve a single state.”
A 2020 local food marketing survey found that the number of farms selling locally produced food fell by 12% nationwide from 2015 to 2020.
Still, Missouri is seeing some growth when it comes to produce farmers. The 2022 Census of Agriculture in Missouri found that the number of farms working in greenhouse, nursery and floriculture production had grown to 485 in 2022, up from 348 in 2017.
In 2021, more than 90% of the farms selling food directly to consumers were considered small farms.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In any other year, the data that informs an annual report released every Thanksgiving by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank would tell the whole story about hunger in the Ocean State. 
But 2025 has been unlike any other year for the Providence-based nonprofit — especially after the recent federal shutdown disrupted benefits for 42 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including 145,000 Rhode Islanders.
Which is why the release of the annual “Status Report on Hunger in Rhode Island” will have to wait until late January.
“The recent federal government shutdown and SNAP delay has been our top priority this fall,” Melissa Cherney, the food bank’s CEO, said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “We remain committed to putting together a comprehensive report and providing an in-depth look at who is food insecure in Rhode Island that takes into account how the government shutdown has impacted food security in our state.”
First released in 2007, the annual report lists how many households across the state struggle to afford adequate meals, receive food assistance, along with policy recommendations on how to reduce hunger.
Last year’s six-page report focused on the need for Congress to expand federal programs like SNAP, which the food bank projected could help the 90,500 households enrolled at the time to easily afford three healthy meals per day. The report had also urged state leaders to reduce barriers for SNAP enrollment.
The food bank’s report typically relies on hunger data compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health as part of its annual RI Life Index survey. But that survey is conducted in the spring. 
Food bank spokesperson Kate MacDonald said the data would not account for the rapid increase in food insecurity across Rhode Island observed this fall during the 43-federal government shutdown.
Food pantries in the state served around 100,000 people in the month of October. Pantries last year served roughly 84,400 individuals per month, which at the time was the highest total tracked by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
“We want to be able to capture that in our status report,” MacDonald said in an interview. “The data we’re working with has to represent what’s going on now.”
Food bank staff had to shift their focus away from completing the report during the shutdown i to ensuring there was enough food to distribute across its 137 affiliated pantries and other agencies, MacDonald added.
SNAP payments have since resumed now that the longest federal shutdown in history has ended, but the fallout continues, MacDonald said.
“Families who were impacted might be seeing these effects for a little while,” she said. “Families have made choices in what bills to pay and what not to pay.”
Then there’s the massive changes to SNAP under President Trump and Republicans’ signature tax legislation, known as the “one big, beautiful bill.” Under the new law, parents and older Americans will be required to meet stricter work requirements, and states eventually will have to share in the cost of SNAP benefits.
The law also cuts off access completely for refugees and other immigrants starting Feb. 1, 2026.
“It’s going to take some time for what that all means for people’s monthly benefits,” MacDonald said.
The food bank’s full 2025 report will be released Jan. 27 to coincide with Food Insecurity Awareness Day, when its leaders will gather at the State House and hold a virtual town hall to discuss the latest findings.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)How best to spend, save and raise money will be a recurring theme when Washington lawmakers convene in Olympia next week for their annual “committee days.” 
The state is facing a budget shortfall that’s poised to dominate the 2026 session, which begins Jan. 12.
Data centers, vaccine safety, bridges hit by trucks, and the states mounting legal payouts are other issues to be tackled in the three days of work sessions, which start Wednesday.
This year, both chambers will be in town at the same time. It will provide a sense of the pace and tenor of policy debates to come in next year’s 60-day session.
Wednesday, Dec. 3, is reserved for meetings of seven committees composed of House and Senate members. On Thursday and Friday, individual House and Senate committees will meet starting at 8 a.m. each day. 
Data Centers will grab the spotlight at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday. That’s when the Joint Committee on Energy Supply, Energy Conservation, and Energy Resilience will hear recommendations of the data center work group established by an executive order from Gov. Bob Ferguson. A report from the work group is due to the governor by Dec. 1. Data centers consume large amounts of electricity, and more are coming online as artificial intelligence technology expands.
Also Wednesday, health insurance costs and vaccine safety will be on the agenda when the Joint Select Committee on Health Care and Behavioral Health Oversight meets at 3 p.m. 
Thursday will be dominated by budget-related conversations.
This year, Democratic lawmakers pushed through billions in new and increased taxes, along with spending cuts, to bridge a projected gap around $16 billion over four years.
Concerns about one of the largest new business taxes that took effect Oct. 1 will be a hot topic in the House Finance Committee at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. 
Senate Bill 5814 imposes new sales taxes on a number of services and is counted on to bring in $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1. Local governments will get a cut of the state sales tax proceeds. Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, the committee chair, has said the law needs fine-tuning to make clearer who is required to collect and pay the taxes.
Operating and transportation expenses will be showcased in four different budget committees meeting at 4 p.m. Thursday.
The Senate Ways and Means Committee has a packed agenda with discussions on future tax collections, growing lawsuit payouts, and state pensions. 
In the House Appropriations Committee, conversations are planned on the state’s budget outlook, plus updates on federal funding and Washington’s strained juvenile rehabilitation system.
Highway maintenance and preservation will be a focus of both the Senate and House transportation panels. The Senate Transportation Committee will devote its one-hour work session to the subject.
Meanwhile, members of the House Transportation Committee will get briefed on how the state Department of Transportation is dealing with bridges damaged by truck collisions. Also on the agenda is an update on the Washington State Ferries multi-billion-dollar electrification program.

Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, recently announced that he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing his belief in term limits as his reason for leaving the Legislature.
Draheim was first elected in 2016 to the state Senate, beating out then Sen. Kevin Dahle as part of the Trump red wave that flipped the state Senate and added state House seats to the GOP majority. 
Draheim has been a leader on housing, human services and mental health issues. 
In 2022, he was the chief author of a law directing more than $92 million to mental health initiatives, including services for uninsured youth and mobile crisis response teams. Draheim also advocated for the creation of the Senate Housing and Homelessness Prevention Committee — it had previously been grouped in a committee with agriculture and rural development — giving housing issues more attention in the Legislature.
Draheim is a business owner, having owned a marina, an event center, a wedding shop and other real estate investments. 
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you decide not to run for re-election?
I never really intended on being a politician, so it wasn’t on my radar, and someone asked me to run. I’ve always been a strong believer in term limits. To me, serving is giving back to the community, and I think the more different voices we have, the better we are. A lot of us (politicians) get sucked into that trap of thinking we’re all important, not remembering that the district is the people’s district, not our district. 
I didn’t want to pick my replacement, so that’s why I announced a year ahead of time that I’m not running — so people have the opportunity to get their ducks in a row if they want to run and then just go through the process like I went through the process 10 years ago.
What will you do with the time you get back from not being in the Legislature?
It’s unknown. I’ve been a habitual business starter, and I don’t think my wife’s gonna let me do that. So I will be looking for a new opportunity, a new challenge. I like to have new challenges, usually about every seven years, so I’m kind of overdue.
What are you most proud of from your time in the Legislature?
The effort. It’s a lot of work to run for office and take out an incumbent like I did in a purple district that historically had gone back and forth. I just worked harder than he did, and I knocked on door after door after door and talked to people, just trying to figure out, what are their needs? What do they think the state should be doing differently? 
I’ve been reporting for a couple years on this effort to build more housing in Minnesota. There’s a few ways you could describe it — zoning reform, rolling back regulations, taking away some local government controls. How real is the bipartisan push to build more housing in Minnesota, and do you think that the Legislature will get a big package done on this?
I hope people open up their eyes a little bit on that. It’s something I’ve been working on for nine years. I view everything through the lens of, the state’s responsibility should be to educate our kids to get a career-path job. That career-path job should lead to a pathway to homeownership. That pathway to homeownership should lead to a pathway to retirement.
We know that most people’s largest asset, overwhelmingly, is their home. We’re chasing perfection on the building code and zoning over the fact that people can’t afford to own a home. At some point, I think society needs to say, time out. I’m comfortable living in a house that has the 2000 building code instead of 2025. I’m okay not having the white picket fence, or the hard surfaces in the front, or I don’t need a three car garage or whatever it is.
I think we have to open it up more to individuals to pick what they can have. I mean, in most of the southern suburbs, you can hardly find a home for under $550,000 and I don’t know how these young people can afford it. 
I ran for my family and my kids, and I want to see Minnesota have an environment where, if they choose to buy a home they can afford one — of course, with hard work and savings and smart business decisions — that should be the goal, and I think we’re pushing away from that at full speed. You look at when Minnesota builds or helps pay for an apartment — there was just one last year that the cost of each individual unit was $631,000. We could do better. Our young families deserve better. Our old families deserve better. Our seniors deserve better.
The cost of everything’s going up, but the cost of insurance has gone up by double digit increases every year. And then property taxes, of course, have gone up.
I was reading the blog post you put out after the Annunciation shooting, in which you basically said the Legislature needs to work more on mental health instead of focusing so much on guns. What gaps do you think still exist in Minnesota’s mental health system, even after the work that you’ve been doing on this for many years?
We barely touched the surface on mental health. We’re so far in a deficit. If I was able, I would propose more training for our young people on how to cope. 
One of my colleagues across the aisle told me it wasn’t a mental health problem, it was a morality problem. Well, to me, part of being defined in mental health is what’s right and what’s wrong. We have a big problem — a large portion of our youth don’t value life, and that’s very scary. To me, a normal person, to think it’d be okay to stand outside of church or school and shoot up a bunch of poor, helpless little kids — that’s not healthy to even think about it, let alone do it or celebrate it. Or a health care executive, or anybody for that matter, a national pundit, whatever it is — we shouldn’t celebrate the murder of any individual. That’s a society problem, but I think our kids need to learn to cope. 
God made us all different. We’re all created a little different. We all are fortunate and have different triggers and this and that, but we’ve got to figure out how to live with it, and I don’t think we do a good enough job. I don’t think families do enough of a job to teach their kids, it’s okay, maybe you need to go read books, go shoot baskets, listen to some music, whatever it is. So I think we need to work on that.
What advice would you give to the person who has your seat after you?
It’s the people’s district. The funnest part of being an elected official was having to dig into a whole bunch of different topics, and every committee you’re on, you have to get caught up. Luckily, we have great staff in our caucus that help us get caught up and understand the federal programs, the state programs, the county programs, how they all interact. That’s a challenge — for every committee it’s different programs. That’s been really rewarding for me is to try to learn about a whole bunch of different topics.
Is there anything else you want people to know about your decision not to run again?
I encourage everybody to give back. Our society is so jaded right now, and I ran for my kids, and I ran to give back. I was at a point in my career where I could take a pay cut — which is a whole other issue — to give back to my region down here in south central Minnesota. We need more people that have life experiences to step up — no matter what their background, because all jobs are honorable — to give back to the state and run for office in some form.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/draheim-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 07:57:51.337645

“As the pace of change accelerates, we need to build a more adaptive and competitive state – standing still now only widens the gap,” Jeff Donofrio, president and CEO of Business Leaders For Michigan, said in a news release. “[Our plan] focuses on changing what’s within our control – three areas that, when working well, have the greatest power to change our state’s trajectory.”
Specifically, the plan calls for leaders to transform education, make Michigan the easiest place to build and grow and to modernize its approach to economic development to activate the state’s economic potential.
Donofrio argued that Michigan’s challenge in retaining talent and building its economy is not based on ideas or effort, but consistency and follow-through. 
“When priorities shift, progress stalls,” Donofrio said. “We need a long-term strategy that endures beyond election cycles. Other states have shown what’s possible when that happens.”
In improving education, the group’s plan calls for the state to ensure every child can read by third grade, tackle chronic absenteeism, set a high standard for a high school diploma, and seamlessly connect students to apprenticeships, college and careers.
It also recommends removing barriers to economic growth by supporting a culture of customer service, streamlining regulations and supporting communities ready to innovate.
In addressing the state’s approach to economic development, Business Leaders for Michigan called for the state to empower its regions and adopt a consistent approach for attracting and retaining talent.
Moving forward, the group said the state must have a plan that goes beyond one governor, political party or interest group, and it must be championed by the governor, built by the Legislature and sustained beyond political terms.
“Michigan’s future will continue to be defined by our ability to come together around a common vision for growth,” said Gary Torgow, the group’s chair. “If we continue to stay focused and work together, Michigan can endeavor to lead the nation in creating opportunity and prosperity for all.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A new report urges New Jersey to step up oversight of hazardous rail-borne freight nearly 13 years after a derailment in Paulsboro released tens of thousands of gallons of a toxic gas that left 60 hospitalized.
The new report from New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning Trenton-based think tank, seeks more transparency on train routes and the creation of evacuation zones along them to guard residents against toxic spills.
“Freight rail companies have spent years lobbying against safety rules while prioritizing their own profits over better infrastructure. Meanwhile, millions of New Jerseyans live in evacuation zones without knowing what chemicals are rolling past their kids’ schools,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst for the think tank and the report’s author. “Lawmakers need to stop letting corporate interests block protections that could save lives.”
What hazardous materials travel on trains around New Jersey? It’s a secret.

The report cautions that the state lacks protections to adequately guard the 3.6 million New Jerseyans who live within a mile of freight lines that could cause toxic spills or fires, plus the more than 1,300 schools and nearly 120 hospitals.
It also urges additional training and hazmat equipment for first responders and stricter safety rules for the trains themselves.
“Far too many people, including state decision makers, are not truly aware of the risk associated with the thousands of trains carrying hazardous materials throughout every corner of our state,” said Debra Coyle, executive director of the New Jersey Work Environment Council.
Gov. Chris Christie in 2017 vetoed legislation that would require rail firms to disclose train routes, citing national security concerns.
The report says that requiring train companies to report past cargo after a time delay and mandating that the Department of Transportation share bridge inspection reports with the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees hazmat control, could increase safety while allaying security risks.
Some officials have long eyed stricter disclosure rules and requiring response plans to hazardous spills from freight companies, but efforts to pass them have stalled in legislative chambers or on the governor’s desk.
Transportation committee chairs in both chambers are seeking to impose stricter rules on freight that would require at least two crew members to operate any train carrying hazardous materials and impose limits on train length. Longer trains are more likely to derail.
“More than a decade after the Paulsboro train derailment, too many New Jersey communities continue to live with the daily risk posed by freight lines that transport hazardous materials through their neighborhoods,” said Assemblyman Clint Calabrese (D-Bergen), who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee.
The 2012 Paulsboro derailment released roughly 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride — a toxic, carcinogenic precursor chemical used in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride polymers — after a conductor’s error sent four train cars off a bridge and into a creek.

Last month, the Federal Highway Administration approved Idaho’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, plans, Idaho Transportation Department Communication Manager John Tomlinson said. 
The NEVI program was created to develop plans for a network of connected electric vehicle charging stations located every 50 miles along designated interstates and highways, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
For several years a working group in Idaho had been developing plans, gathering public feedback and identifying potential sites for electric vehicle charging stations when the federal government halted all work on the projects and suspended approving state plans, the Sun previously reported. On Feb. 6, less than three weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, Federal Highway Administration officials sent state transportation directors letters saying they were immediately suspending approving state plans and rescinding past guidance for the NEVI program.

State officials were told to await further federal guidance, which then arrived in August.
On Sept. 10, Idaho Transportation Department Director Scott Stokes resubmitted Idaho’s plans and requested the state’s share of funding for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026, the Sun previously reported. 
Stokes included a siting, feasibility and access study from 2024 when he resubmitted Idaho’s plans and pointed out the parts of Idaho’s plans that addressed the latest federal government guidance from August. But Stokes did not make any big changes to Idaho’s plans, which were updated in 2023 and 2024.
Last month, the feds approved Idaho’s plans, which gives Idaho the authority to get back to work on the state’s NEVI project, Tomlinson said.
“Now that the NEVI Plan has been approved by the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA), we will gather as an interagency working group again in the near future to discuss what delivering the program looks like in Idaho,” Tomlinson wrote in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “This will be with (the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Transportation Department).”
Prior to being ordered to suspend work on the program, Idaho’s working group had begun narrowing down the list of potential locations for electric vehicle charging stations, including identifying potential sites along highway corridors near Pocatello, Bliss and Lewiston. 
Funding for the NEVI program was authorized under the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act that former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2021.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1232464216-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 06:56:20.238641

The Center for Effective Lawmaking analyzed the 118th Congress by party and chamber to determine who the most effective lawmakers were overall and by policy area. The Center is a joint partnership between schools at Vanderbilt University and University of Virginia.
On the Republican side, senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin and U.S. Rep. Tom Cole were highlighted in the report as being some of the most effective. 
The most effective lawmakers are determined by combining 15 metrics, including the number of bills sponsored, how far those make it in the lawmaking process and how substantial the proposals are, according to the report. 
Cole, who represents Oklahoma’s Fourth Congressional District and chairs the House Appropriations Committee, was ranked the third most effective House Republican. He introduced 20 bills and two became law. 
He was also named the most effective House Republican in the policy area of macroeconomics.
“I am a tireless advocate for the taxpayers, passionate about the need to produce a budget that can be utilized to defend our country as well as meet legitimate domestic needs, and willing to work in a bipartisan manner,” Cole said in a statement. “With that being said, I am so proud and honored to be named as one of the most effective House Republicans.” 
Lankford was ranked as the seventh most effective Senate Republican, a new addition to the top 10 list, according to the report. He sponsored 56 bills and two became law. 
He was also named the most effective senator of his party in the policy area of government operations. 
Spokespeople for Lankford did not return a request for comment by the time of publication. 
Mullin was named the most effective Senate Republican in the area of agriculture policy. His overall ranking among Senate Republicans was 37th. 
“As a lifelong cow-calf rancher, agriculture is truly a way of life for us in Oklahoma,” Mullin said in a statement. “In the Senate, I’m fighting to ensure our farmers and ranchers are heard in the legislative process. … While I appreciate the recognition as the most effective Senate Republican for ag, we’ve got more to do. I’ll always put our ag community first and do everything in my power to protect our rural way of life for generations to come.”

Saying farewell to Wyoming is a hard thing. A WyoFile reporter bemoans doing it twice. 
The post A Wyoming goodbye, again appeared first on WyoFile .","I took this photograph in January, just days after moving back to Wyoming from California. 
It’s the view out the window above my desk in WyoFile’s Laramie office. After four years living in California, the visage this day, with snow on the roofs and sidewalks and the sun fading prettily behind the mountains, was a nice welcome home. 
The photograph contains within its frame much of what I love most about Wyoming — the quiet and the community. The rooftops and footprints remind me that beneath Laramie’s complications and contradictions lies the bedrock of a village mentality. It’s a place, like so many towns in Wyoming, where people have gathered together in the middle of an empty, often harsh landscape to build lives together.
Saying goodbye to Wyoming is a hard thing. When I left in the winter of 2021, I had spent five years at WyoFile, the start of my journalism career. I’d lived in Lander, Gillette, Cheyenne and Laramie and filed stories from most towns in the state, as well as a few from a mobile hotspot on a roadside. Leaving on Interstate 80, my heart tugged me backward. Driving west felt like post-holing through deep snow, with a hard-blowing Wyoming headwind to boot. 
One would have to be crazy to say goodbye to Wyoming twice. Alas, I am crazy, or at least restless, so come next week, I’ll be doing just that. In late October, I took a job at the Sacramento Bee covering California’s Legislature. It has been wonderful living in Wyoming again and working with the expanded and ever-more talented team at WyoFile, but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to write about one of the most-watched statehouses in the country. 
So soon enough, I’ll be packing my belongings and battling those headwinds and heartstrings back down Interstate 80, headed west on the highway I drove east on just a year ago. Who knows, maybe the local U-Haul dealer still has the trailer I rode in with. 
My stay this time around was far too short, but at least I packed in a lot of Wyoming. I wore out the tires on my truck chasing stories into Riverton, Rock Springs, Torrington and points in between. I watched the falling sun turn the walls of the Wind River Canyon pink after catching a hard-fighting rainbow trout — and losing more than a few. I bit my skis into untracked powder as I swooped through the silent forests of the Snowy Mountain Range. I clutched my suit jacket tighter around my body and cursed politicians, politics and the very idea of “the news” as I walked through the biting morning wind to the statehouse in Cheyenne. And I swung open the red metal door of a Laramie dive bar, stepping out of the winter night and into the good cheer of a room full of people I know and am fond of. 
So, I hate to leave you again. And who’s to say I won’t ask you to take me back again. But for now it’s goodbye again, Wyoming. There is, quite certainly, no other place like you.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Every home game, Memorial Stadium becomes Nebraska’s third-largest city for roughly three hours, as it will Friday against Iowa.  
Nebraska football and sports are as close to religion as the Cornhusker State’s people will allow. The university’s 85,000-seat stadium has sold out every home game since 1962, feeding more than $1 million in economic impact into the state every weekend the Huskers play at home.
Volleyball engenders similar levels of devotion, selling out the 10,000-seat Bob Devaney Sports Center and packing local restaurants and bars. But those two sports are hardly alone, as other Nebraska athletes know.

Playing for the Huskers also has its advantages in state politics. Several Nebraska athletics alums have run for political office, ranging from school and university boards to Congress and the Governor’s Mansion.
The house’s current occupant, Gov. Jim Pillen, is a former University of Nebraska defensive back, a former NU regent and a hog producer. But he is perhaps best known for recovering a game-sealing fumble against Oklahoma in 1978.
His first campaign for governor ran a biographical advertisement in 2022 recalling that moment in scarlet and cream. Nebraska earned an Orange Bowl berth with the win and shared the Big Eight football title with the Sooners. 
“And Beat Oklahoma,” Pillen said in the political ad. “I mean … lead the nation in job creation.”

Not all Big Red political candidates succeed, University of Nebraska-Lincoln political science professor Kevin Smith said, but playing for the Huskers gives them some “goodwill” at a time when public skepticism and cynicism reign. 
“We’re living in an era where expertise is mistrusted fairly extensively,” Smith said. 
The value of celebrity in politics isn’t new. 
Long before President Donald Trump revived belief in its power, there was former President Ronald Reagan, a movie star. Another west-coast movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, joined Reagan in serving as California’s governor. 
Even traditional politicians seek celebrity endorsements to reach different pockets of people in the hopes of boosting voter turnout. One recent example: Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign touted endorsements from Beyoncé, Leonardo DiCaprio and Taylor Swift, to name a few. Harris won Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Trump won statewide.

In Nebraska, the Huskers are local celebrities. And the list of current, past and potential candidates with ties to NU athletics is long.
Former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, a Republican candidate in Nebraska’s 2nd District for the U.S. House, was a backup quarterback for Nebraska from 1999 to 2003. 
Preston Love Jr., a defensive end in the early 1960s who was part of Nebraska’s Magnificent Eight, ran for the U.S. Senate twice in the past five years. The Democrat was the state’s first African-American U.S. Senate nominee of a major political party.
Jim McFarland, a tight end in the 1960s, served in the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 1986 and ran for governor in 1998 as a Democrat but lost in the primary.  
Hall of Fame college football coach Tom Osborne served three terms in the U.S. House representing the state’s rural 3rd district and lost a competitive GOP primary bid for governor in 2006 to an incumbent, Dave Heineman. 
Pillen, who still calls Osborne “coach,” played for the Huskers from 1975 to 1978.  Trump endorsed Pillen for reelection on Tuesday, and the president mentioned Pillen’s NU playing days in the endorsement.

Nebraska volleyball middle blocker Rebekah Allick was in a political ad for a successful ballot initiative that banned abortions after the first trimester in the state constitution, with exceptions for the life of the mother, rape, and incest. The ad also featured five Nebraska softball players, including pitcher Jordy Bahl.
“Out-of-state activists are pushing a radical amendment, Initiative 439,” Allick said in the ad. 
Allick, who is in her senior year at UNL, also attended the signing ceremony for State Sen. Kathleen Kauth’s bill that requires all student-athletes competing in public K-12 or college sports to play on teams that match their sex at birth. 
Former student-athletes Payton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player from North Carolina, and Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer, attended.

People at the time criticized the Husker athletes for participating.  Audrey Horn, a Planned Parenthood volunteer, told CBS affiliate KMTV that “Husker athletes are like celebrities. So [Protect Women and Children] are leveraging that name recognition, team recognition for their political goals.” 
Allick, speaking with the Examiner, said her experience with politics hasn’t been “great,” but said it’s more about her “faith,” adding that many student-athletes are scared to be political or speak on controversial topics because of the fear of losing sponsorships, popularity and even friendships.
“I have been told like ‘you shouldn’t use your platform,” Allick said. “‘You should just stick to talking about sports.’ But I’m a Christian. I’m a daughter. I’m a sister way before I was an athlete.”

Axiom Strategies Nebraska State Director Daniel Bass, who was directly involved in the ad, said the athletes appearing in the ad were motivated by their passion for the issue. 
“I can’t speak to their future plans, but they’d certainly have a bright future in public service,” Bass said. 
Part of the increasing value of celebrity in politics ties to the rise of populism. It has emerged as a driving force in today’s politics, as some voters have lost faith in institutions and seek alternatives. 
“Nebraskans have a great affinity for sports, and who’s a part of it … sometimes it can be really good [or it] can be a kick in the shins,” Pillen told the Examiner. “Just depends.”  
Pillen and nearly every member of Nebraska’s all-GOP congressional delegation attend most Husker games, as do many members of the Legislature. Former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., used to sell Runzas during Husker games.
Regular attendees include Republican U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, House Republicans Mike Flood, Don Bacon and Adrian Smith. Political candidates, including nonpartisan former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn has tailgated near the stadium. State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln, a season ticketholder, says he rarely misses a game.

UNL and other NU campuses provide access to a limited number of athletics event tickets to legislators as part of the university’s outreach as a state-funded institution, a connection that grows in value as state budgets get tighter. Athletics at UNL is self-funding, a rarity in modern college athletics.
Smith, the UNL professor, said a career in sports can only take people so far, as former players will eventually be judged by how they govern rather than their playing days, because politics is a “different ball game.” 
“Just because you’re good at one [sports], doesn’t mean that you’re going to be good at the other [politics],” Smith said.
Lindstrom, while in the Legislature, helped pass legislation that phased out taxes on Social Security income and pushed bills aimed at reducing income tax rates. He faced criticism for some of his votes, including on the death penalty and how to pay for road construction. 
Lindstrom told the Examiner he doesn’t know if he would be in state politics had he not played Nebraska’s football.
“There’s a lot of stuff behind the scenes that people don’t see with football and politics,” Lindstrom said.

Playing for NU helped Lindstrom prepare for interviews, stump speeches and debates, he said. He compared it to training in the off-season. Running for office takes discipline, he said, and campaigning takes a lot of teamwork — skills that he learned while playing football.
During his bid for governor in 2022, Lindstrom ran a TV ad that emphasized his “teamwork” as a Nebraska football player. It said he would bring “a new generation of leadership” to the state. He lost to Pillen, a fellow Husker alum.
Then and now, Lindstrom said he tried to avoid using his football experience as a selling point, because it could also be a negative, and he has government experience. He pushed back against his staff, who wanted to air a campaign ad for governor about him playing for the Huskers, saying it had been 22 years” since he played.
Smith, the UNL political science professor, said celebrity helps cut through a moment in politics when people distrust politicians.

Smith said the ways in which many people get their information also plays a role. Social media, for instance, has displaced much of traditional media for many.
As Sasse discussed during his most recent Senate campaign, people started treating party and political loyalty like their love of sports teams and religious affiliation, as non-negotiable loyalty tests that define how people interact with one another.
Said Smith: “We’re living in a highly polarized environment where people are increasingly taking politics as a core part of their identity.” 
This time around, Lindstrom plans to focus on his experience as a former state lawmaker, not his days playing for the Cornhuskers, in his bid to be the 2nd District GOP nominee against Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding. But people remember.
“We did it [for governor],” Lindstrom said. “Never again.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)When Thanksgiving rolls around, one thing Montanans pretty much all agree on is how lucky we are to be living in this incredible state.  As ecosystems and native species vanish across the globe, our mountains, plains, forests and rivers still support virtually all the fish, wildlife and native plants that were here when Lewis and Clark went through more than 200 years ago.  Given the largely degraded and degrading state of the rest of the nation and world, that’s pretty much a miracle — and one for which thanks is fully justified.
But of course, it’s not just the incredible landscape we call home for which to give gratitude.  In a nation facing intentionally planned political division and hatred of “the other,” Montanans aren’t irreparably split into opposing teams.  In large part that’s due to the very nature of where we live.  Howling winds, driving rains, temperatures dropping to well below zero and snowstorms that can dump feet in a day or less.
Montanans rely on each other far more than those living in concrete canyons shadowed by skyscrapers.  Here, no one asks what political party or “movement” you belong to before offering a hand to pull you out of a ditch, give you a hand hauling out an elk, or towing a boat with a bum motor back to the dock.  And that attitude, despite our differences of opinion on any given subject or issue, is what binds us all as Montanans under our Big Sky.
Yet, if gratitude is well warranted, so, too, is the flip side of that coin — which is the responsibility to maintain and restore for generations yet to come what we are so lucky to have been given.  And in that regard, public policy and the politicians responsible for developing and funding it are absolutely critical.
The simple truth is that Montana has been through the “rape and scrape” era of the state’s early years.  We still bear the deep scars left by cattle, mining, logging, and railroad barons and we’re still picking up the pieces and trying to put what was damaged and destroyed back together.
We took some hard shots, but we also learned the grim lessons of unregulated development and resource extraction, as reflected in our world-famous Constitution’s guarantees of the inalienable right to “a clean and healthful environment” and that “all lands disturbed by the taking of natural resources shall be reclaimed.”
While the visionary giants of the past are long gone, the benefits of the policies they courageously sponsored live on.  We still have wilderness — and the vast diversity of wildlife, fisheries and native plants that make their homes there. We still have wild and scenic rivers. We still have incredible national parks that are the envy of the world.
None of this was by accident. It took brave politicians who bucked the trends of their times, who stood up to the greedy extractive interests and their puppets in the state and national legislative arenas.
Now, with a flood of billionaires and developers bringing the next wave of destruction, pollution and irreparable damage to Montana, we need a few more brave politicians to see past their demands and “just say no” when the damages — particularly to existing Montana residents and landscapes — outweigh the dollars.
They’re coming for the rare natural amenities we still have thanks to the brave politicians of the past.  What we need right now are a few more brave politicians, those with the courage to say “Montana is not for sale” — and for which Montanans will be thankful long after they’re gone.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BigHole14-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-28 06:56:20.238641

(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — An Omaha entity tasked with helping revive some of the most depressed neighborhoods in Nebraska is at odds with state officials it said are refusing to release $11 million in state funds needed for programming.
The Omaha Inland Port Authority, which was authorized by state law and created by the city to promote economic development in northeast Omaha, said it may have to turn to legal action. 
“It slows down our progress,” said State Sen. Terrell McKinney, who chairs the port authority board. “We had things on the table we wanted to launch.”

The North Omaha lawmaker, who helped champion port authority legislation, said the held-up funds should be boosting programming in the roughly 3,000-acre port authority district, including housing and entrepreneurial development. 
“It seems like an intentional effort to make things hard,” said McKinney. “It doesn’t make sense — if they want economic development in the state. I just don’t understand it.”
 ‘Sufficiently vague’ 

An Oct. 20 letter to the Nebraska State Treasurer’s Office outlines a back-and-forth that began in July, with the port authority requesting the funds it said it is due under law. 
Correspondence obtained by the Nebraska Examiner referred to a Sept. 24 response from then-Treasurer Tom Briese saying state law was “sufficiently vague that an immediate release of these funds to the OIPA would not be prudent.”
McKinney contends that there is nothing vague about the language, and he believes Briese, who was a former lawmaker, had consulted with other state officials.
He said Briese “blatantly refused to release the dollars … going against the state statute which clearly outlines what he is supposed to do.” 
Briese resigned as treasurer Nov. 3, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg to replace him, and Spellerberg was sworn in three days later.

The Examiner on Wednesday sought Spellerberg’s response to the standoff. Noting he was just settling in, he said he had talked that same day with OIPA executive director Garry Clark to set up a meeting about the funding.
The stalled funding comes as the State of Nebraska faces a growing, $471 million deficit. The Legislature is to begin its next session in January, with the Pillen administration and others on the lookout for budget trims.
Projects within the OIPA boundaries have faced some criticism in the Legislature. With installation of its inaugural nine-member board in June 2024, the port authority essentially launched. 
It oversees what many tout as the largest public investment of job and business creation in northeast Omaha’s modern history and has powers such as selling bonds to finance construction and infrastructure within its designated zone.
 Omaha mayor and Chamber CEO sign on

Clark was hired this past summer as the public entity’s first executive director. He is helping steer projects in the district, including a $90 million state-funded plan for a North Omaha business park and a $30 million grant from the state to seed an “innovation district.”
To help carry out Omaha operations, McKinney and then-State Sen. Justin Wayne, also of North Omaha, helped secure additional dollars for the Omaha port authority program by legislatively directing interest from state funding pots such as the Perkins County Canal and new prison projects. 
As a result, the board had expected to receive an $11 million installment in July — the funds the port authority says are being withheld.
‘Unlikely Viking’ foresees revival of Nebraska area ‘stopped in time’ 

The Oct. 20 letter to Briese was signed by Clark, McKinney, Carmen Tapio, a North Omaha business owner who chairs the OIPA finance committee, Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.
The group asked that the interest funds be released by Nov. 3 and named the applicable statute that governs the process. 
“We are disappointed by your decision not to release these funds following our application sent on July 17, 2025. We are requesting a prompt response to hopefully conclude the matter without further delay.”
The group wrote that the state law provides for the grant award to be triggered by an application that is not subject to “further review” by the state treasurer so long as funds are available. 
“There appears to be no legal reason to refuse the award,” it said.
The group endorsing the letter said the Legislature has had “ample opportunity” to debate and amend pertinent language and “chose not to, respecting the compromises, negotiations and work to arrive at the final law.”

(Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)The city of St. Gabriel has zero major fast food chain restaurants, pharmacies or laundromats. But there are nearly a dozen chemical facilities within city limits and at least 30 within a 10 mile radius.
“We have bad smells here at night,” said Reginald Grace, 72, a retired counselor and lifelong resident. “Like a rotten egg, like chlorine.”
The air on a regular day in St. Gabriel is acrid — but many residents seem not to notice anymore. Grace has spent the last 10 years organizing residents against the growing chemical industry. The city is located in Louisiana’s infamous “Cancer Alley” — an 85-mile stretch of land between Baton Rouge and New Orleans home to over 200 industrial facilities along the Mississippi River, where the risk of cancer from industrial air pollution is the highest in the nation.
In the past few years, Grace said several of his neighbors have been diagnosed with or died of cancer. His wife of 41 years, Rhonda, had breast cancer, ovarian cancer and leukemia, which she died of in 2023, despite having no known family history of any of the three, Grace said. He added that he is in remission from prostate cancer.
St. Gabriel is home to the Syngenta agrochemical facility, which repackages a popular but highly toxic farming pesticide known as paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone before it is distributed to other states. The plant is owned by the Chinese company SinoChem Holdings Ltd.
A report released in October by Coming Clean, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and Pesticide Action and Agroecology Network warned of the dangers of paraquat exposure. Banned in over 70 countries, it remains one of the most commonly used chemicals by farmers in the United States for weed management — with the largest point of entry in the last eight years being the Port of New Orleans, according to Jim Vallete, a contributing researcher to the report.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that inhaling paraquat can cause lung damage. Some research shows that exposure to the chemical is associated with Parkinson’s disease, including a 2020 Louisiana State University study that concluded there was a greater risk of the disease in areas where pesticides, including paraquat, were used. There is currently litigation in Illinois federal court involving over 5,000 people suing Syngenta for alleged development of Parkinson’s from exposure to paraquat.
A sign for Syngenta’s facility, the agrochemical community at the heart of a recent study on paraquat, sits in front of a parking lot with industrial buildings behind it in St. Gabriel on Oct. 22, 2025.

An Environmental Protection Agency memo from 2017 noted that the chemical is so toxic that “one sip can kill.” The same memo said even minimal contact can cause serious injury to the eyes and skin.
The paraquat report includes several statements from farm workers across the country who have allegedly suffered harmful health impacts from exposure to the pesticide. Paraquat has also been linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, the report finds. From production to distribution to application, the report concludes that factory workers, port workers and farm laborers are all at risk of unsafe exposure.
Syngenta declined Verite News’ request to comment on its factory’s health and environmental safety regulations as well as the use of paraquat in Louisiana farming. The facility’s parent company’s home country, China, banned the domestic use of paraquat in 2016.
Human Rights Watch reported last year that Cancer Alley residents commonly suffer from respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic coughs and sinus infections. Migraines, miscarriages and dementia are also common complaints among St. Gabriel residents, according to Grace.
He added that he and other local activists — many of whom said they appreciate the close-knit community, childhood memories and laidback feel of the town —  are not asking for all of the plants to close down. They just want stricter monitoring of the impact on the environment.
“I’m not advocating cutting the plants out,” Grace said. “I know they’ve invested a lot of money into it, but what are you going to do, put money over safety?”

Made with Flourish

Ongoing debate on chemical safety
St. Gabriel incorporated as a city in 1994 partially to have more of a say against the growing chemical industry. The population decreased from a peak of 7,500 in 2020 but is once again growing as of 2022 according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Grace said the area has become popular with retirees from Baton Rouge looking for peace and quiet. Today, the population of roughly 6,800 must travel to the neighboring cities of Baton Rouge or Gonzales for jobs and many basic necessities such as medical care and fresh groceries.
“There’s nothing in this community. It’s a city, but there are no amenities,” Grace said. “People who grew up here, the children, don’t stay.”
Following the publication of the paraquat report last month, Verite News reporters visited St. Gabriel and the surrounding area to speak with residents about their ongoing efforts to minimize the harmful effects of living in an industrial hotspot.
Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish. He’s aware that his farm is located in Cancer Alley and said he’s never used a product containing paraquat and aims to gradually eliminate the use of synthetic chemicals on his fields.
“We don’t really need to have the amount of chemicals that we use, because we can go back to farming the way our grandfathers and great-grandfathers used to farm,” Conish said.

Of the 10 acres Conish currently farms, roughly one acre contains no chemicals at all. Conish said once he learns how to make his model cost-effective, he wants to help bring about a farming revolution that helps low-income families in the area learn to sustain themselves in a healthy way.
Conish grows plenty of okra, which he said has antioxidants that he believes fight cancer — especially important “being in an environment that is filled with cancer emissions coming from every direction,” he said. Medical research has yet to conclusively prove that antioxidants do prevent cancer.
Many of Cancer Alley’s chemical plants are located in or near poor and mostly Black neighborhoods. As a Black farmer, Conish added that he believes chemical plants in the area take advantage of the region’s poverty. He wants to see greater regulation of the plants.
“Chronic poverty is a vestige of slavery,” he said. “Without chronic poverty, they wouldn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of poor people and promise them jobs, and I use the word ‘promise’ loosely.”
In a statement to Verite News, David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, called paraquat “a vital chemical to our farmers.”
“Farmers around the world have moved to adopt no-till farming, but this is only possible because herbicides like paraquat are used to control weeds while keeping soil undisturbed,” Cresson wrote. “It remains a widely utilized herbicide due to its fast-acting control of resistant weeds, compatibility with conservation tillage, and lack of residual soil activity.”
Herbicides are a type of pesticide that target weeds and unwanted vegetation.
Cresson added that U.S. regulatory agencies have reviewed scientific studies on the links between paraquat use and Parkinson’s disease and have not found a causal relationship. He did not address why 70 countries have banned the pesticide for health and safety reasons.
Navigating a shared space
Jan Drinkwater, 77, moved to East Iberville, just outside of St. Gabriel, more than 40 years ago. A breast cancer survivor, she said she was not informed of the air pollution in the area beforehand and wishes the agrochemical industry was better regulated.
“We have terrible odors from time to time,” she said. “This is current and frequent. … Why can’t they put that on the news?”
Drinkwater said as a resident, she should be made aware of what she is breathing. She added that despite the health risks, she still enjoys many enrichment activities at the St. Gabriel senior center and does not mind the lack of businesses in the city.
“I didn’t really move here for restaurants,” she said. “I wish it could remain rural … I would never want to go anywhere else.”
Melvin Craige, 75, has known Grace since childhood. Previously the director of St. Gabriel’s community center, Craige said he’s seen how the chemical industry contributes to the community by making investments such as refurbishing the community center’s weight room.
“When I was a director, they did all of the equipment and everything in the community center. They did a heck of a lot of programming,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Craige said he is also aware of scientific research pointing to links between the industry and medical problems facing residents.
“We just buried one of my cousins here Saturday who died of cancer,” he said.
Craige said he would like to see the community and the industry cooperate even more to monitor emissions to ensure better health conditions for the people of St. Gabriel.
One forum that the community and the industrial sector use to communicate on employment opportunities, safety and environmental concerns and industry expansion is the local community advisory panel. The East Iberville Community Advisory Panel has existed since at least the 1990s, and it currently meets every other month on Syngenta property, according to advisory panel members who spoke with Verite News.

Alex Robertson, 56, who has lived in St. Gabriel since his childhood, has been attending the panel’s meetings for about a year.
“We always sit back and complain, and we say what somebody is not doing, but the question is, ‘What are you doing?’” Robertson asked.
Robertson said he worked at the Koura plant in St. Gabriel for 30 years. Now retired, he remains a youth pastor at the Iberville Christian Center. He said his professional success is a testament to the industry providing well-paying jobs. He also said chemicals produced in the city contribute to everyday products Americans use to make their lives better.
But a recent Tulane University study showed Black Louisiana residents live in areas most affected by industrial pollution, yet make up the smallest portion of the industry’s workforce. Iberville Parish, where St. Gabriel is located, was shown to be home to the third largest share of the highest-paying manufacturing jobs in the state — but people of color were underrepresented among these positions.
Robertson joins the advisory panel’s meetings as a volunteer and liaises with the St. Gabriel City Council at public meetings on matters pertaining to the industry. He said he believes in the importance of the industry being a “good steward” to the community, by providing more high-paying jobs to local residents and offering educational opportunities — such as having plant engineers tutor kids at the local schools.
Good stewards should also not pollute the city, he said, and if they do, they should be upfront about it with the community.

‘The fight is not over with’ 
In addition to helping lead Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel, a local advocacy group, Grace sits on the board of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), an environmental not-for-profit.
Grace said one of his biggest wins against the chemical industry was in 2017, when he and Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel members successfully fought against Adsorbent Solutions, a local carbon reactivation plant that had sought to expand its operations.
“We told the council, if y’all do this, you’re killing your own people,” Grace said.
The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017. Adsorbent Solutions closed down its facility shortly after the vote.
Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s. In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.
“We tried, we waited, we went through all the right authorities,” she said. “But the experience with St. Gabriel was that the public entities did not want the stationary monitor on their property.”
Orr said LEAN plans to expand the air monitoring project and has not given up on installing sensors in St. Gabriel.


Let us know what you think...


 

Lionel Johnson has been St. Gabriel’s mayor since 2011. Despite multiple requests, he did not schedule an interview to talk about public health, the economy and the proliferation of chemical facilities.
“He’s a coward,” Grace said. “He doesn’t mix well with people, but he’s highly educated, and he talks at people instead of talking to them.”
Grace’s son Kyle ran against Johnson in the last mayoral election in 2023, losing by only a slim margin. Kyle Grace’s platform centered on bringing more businesses to St. Gabriel, while Johnson focused on expanding city services.
Reginald Grace said he finds that much of the city has become “complacent” to the harmful health effects of the chemical industry.
“A lot of people are not educated to the fact that they can demand more,” he said. “They’re just trying to live from day to day.”
Grace said despite the health risks, he has remained in St. Gabriel all these years because of his family’s ties to the area and the difficulties of starting over somewhere new.
“I hope I live a few more good years,” he said. “Whatever damage has been done, it’s been done.”
Although the chemical industry has only grown in St. Gabriel, Grace said he urges the younger generation not to pack up and leave or cease their advocacy efforts.
“We’re trying to help the young people understand they have to get involved, they have to be educated and they have to work toward self-improvement,” he said. “The fight is not over with.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Farmers across the nation are unlikely to be taking a check to the bank at the end of harvest — at least not checks big enough to cover their debt payments. But the government’s so-called remedies are a lesson in contradiction.
As statistics refute themselves, regulations harm more than protect, and trade barriers exasperate challenges facing domestic producers, the government’s role in farming is only adding to the red.
Government data ineptly grasps the financial condition facing farmers. On one hand, the United States Department of Agriculture predicts farm income will increase by 21.65 percent for 2025. But at the same time, direct government payments are expected to increase by 354 percent!
The government is confused by its own statistics and tactics. Despite improved net farm income, federal direct farm support is increasing while farms are dwindling. In all but Idaho, the mountain states exceed the national loss of 8.5% of farms between 2016 and 2024. Data clearly indicates that the numbers and/or tactics are overdrawn.
The only clarification comes for Midwestern farmers. According to the Federal Reserve of Kansas City, Midwestern farm lending activity expanded in 2024, with volume of new loans increasing 40% year-over-year. The story hasn’t brightened in the first quarter of 2025, with weakening agricultural credit conditions, while demand for farm loans continues to grow.
Unfortunately for Western farmers, the Federal Reserve of San Francisco only delivers a one-paragraph qualitative summary alluding to the assumptions of industry contacts. But local voices reiterate that the situation isn’t any better for the mountain states.
Fred Burmester, an Idaho hay farmer, said, “It was a really bad year last year. The commodity prices dropped a lot for us … and our production costs were close to the same.” Regarding an operating loan at 9.2 percent that Burmester took out, he said, “It’s going to take years to pay that back.”
State promulgated regulations also add to this financial difficulty for the mountain state region. In 2022, Washington experienced a 40% increase in farm-related expenses, thanks to the removal of the ag overtime exemption. 29.8% of these costs were attributed to an escalation in labor expenses, which had increased by 52% year-over-year. Another major contributor (10%) was expenses attributed to “marketing, storage, and transportation,” due to the carbon tax.
Tariffs exploit another vulnerability of the mountain states because of our reliance on imported agricultural inputs (like fertilizer) and the global retaliation toward American products. Idaho, Montana, Washington and Wyoming ship their agricultural products across the world, and these markets are not easily reclaimed.
The second Trump administration’s renewed trade war bounced the check on America’s farm resilience. These recent trade disputes revealed long-existing weaknesses in the agricultural economy. Long-term consolidation and anti-competitive trends among agricultural input suppliers have steadily pinched the agricultural economy. Now, in the face of tighter supply chains and global trade wars, the vulnerability of a low-competition system is apparent.
When 70 percent of each market space is controlled by 2-3 suppliers, the companies have less economic incentive to be responsive to one farmer’s needs. A recent Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing even listened to testimony on these trends. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman) said, “America’s farmers are the most productive in the world. They take the risk, put in the work and feed the United States and much of the world. But they also operate on thin profit margins.”
These thin profit margins are quickly giving way to overdrawn farm accounts, despite the USDA’s estimates that the average net farm income was above $80,000 in 2024. For anyone involved in agriculture in the last five years, very few “average” farmers deposited such sums in their bank accounts. Nor is a recovery expected in 2025, with a record corn harvest overflowing the silos and continuing the price decline.
Yet, the government’s efforts for recovery are more like a teenager with a credit card, rather than a responsible party paying down the debt. Poor data collection outside of Midwestern farms, increases in state regulations, disregard for anti-competitive behavior, and resumed trade disputes all continue to hurt farm margins.
We need policies that improve resiliency and decrease farmer vulnerability to government choices.

A new Roanoke College survey shows Virginians trimming holiday budgets this year while shifting more of their spending toward gifts. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginians plan to dial back holiday spending this year, trimming budgets by about 5% even as the broader economy shows strong growth, according to a new Institute for Policy and Opinion Research survey at Roanoke College.
The poll found that households expect to spend an average of $1,035 this season in Virginia — down from last year — and they’re shifting how they spend, putting more toward gifts while cutting back on personal purchases and experiences.
That pattern echoes national signals of caution. According to the latest Gallup poll, Americans expect to spend about $1,007 on holiday gifts this year, nearly unchanged from the $1,014 forecast last year.
Meanwhile, the Deloitte 2025 Holiday Retail Survey found U.S. consumers plan to spend an average of $1,595, a 10% drop from 2024, indicating restraint in spending on goods and experiences.
 A shift toward “core” holiday spending

The Roanoke College survey, conducted Nov. 9–14 among 912 Virginians, shows a clear recalibration. 
Planned spending on gifts is up 10.6%, while personal, non-gift purchases — such as apparel, electronics and home décor — are down 16.5%. Spending on experiences like dining out and entertainment is down 19.6%.
That shift toward essential holiday traditions mirrors national patterns: consumers preserving the emotional center of the season while scaling back discretionary extras. 
Analysts attribute this to price pressure, job market concerns and tariff-driven cost increases. 
“Holiday spending plans reflect a balancing act between optimism and caution,” said Dr. Alice Louise Kassens, senior analyst for IPOR and dean of Roanoke College’s School of Business, Economics, and Analytics. 
“While the economy shows strong headline growth, households are tightening overall budgets, reallocating dollars toward gifts and away from non-essential purchases and experiences.”
Income brackets also shape spending expectations in Virginia. 
Fewer households plan to spend between $100 and $500; instead more are at the low end (under $100) or high end (more than $1,000). Lower-income households are concentrated in lower spending tiers, while higher-income Virginians more often expect to spend above $1,000.
 Strong GDP, softer labor market

The new survey arrives against a complex economic backdrop. 
National GDP growth remains strong: the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model estimates annualized quarterly growth at 4%. That underscores consumer spending’s role — roughly 70% of the total economy. 
Yet households may not feel that strength. Year-over-year inflation is at about 3%, and labor-market indicators are showing softening relative to 2024.
Those conditions align with national consumer-sentiment readings. While spending intentions remain elevated, confidence is cautious. Tariffs are adding cost pressure in import-heavy categories such as apparel and electronics — items Virginia households say they’re cutting back on. 
In fact, “the continued shift to online shopping, accounting for more than half of planned holiday purchases, underscores consumers’ desire for convenience and value in a season marked by uncertainty. For small businesses, this trend highlights the importance of digital presence and competitive pricing to capture holiday demand,” Kassens said.
 Digital continues its climb

Digital shopping is now the dominant channel in Virginia. The IPOR poll found that 56% of planned holiday purchases will happen online, up four points from 2024. 
That mirrors national retail-industry forecasts: in the U.S., the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) of $1.01–$1.02 trillion this year — a 3.7%–4.2% rise over 2024. 
For Virginia retailers, that means refining digital offerings and value messaging could be key. “Consumers are celebrating the season, but with sharper priorities and a watchful eye on costs,” Kassens said.
Overall, the IPOR survey paints a picture of Virginians trying to reconcile the mixed signals of the current economy. While GDP growth is robust, price levels and job-market clouds are giving households reason to pause. 
Across the country, many shoppers say they plan the same or lower spending compared to last year: Gallup found 56% of Americans expect to spend about the same, 23% less.
Other national studies capture that same tension. Deloitte’s survey found 77% of respondents expect higher holiday prices and 57% anticipate a weaker economy in 2026.
Many are employing value-seeking behavior: trading down brands, waiting for deals, and making DIY or handmade gifts. 
“Retailers should anticipate strong demand for early online promotions, streamlined delivery options, and competitive pricing strategies as consumers seek value and efficiency,” Kassens advised.

Justin Taylor/The Current GAWhat’s more bipartisan than a good meal?
Amid a number of contentious partisan debates, it can sometimes feel rare to find issues that lawmakers from across the aisle can agree on. But under the Georgia state Capitol’s gold dome — as in life — food often serves as a uniting force.
Lawmakers chewed on a number of food-related bills during the 2025 legislative session, spanning policies on lab-grown meat to which baked good is worthy of being Georgia’s official state bread. Here’s a few you should know.
Dinner with a side of foreign policy
As you sit down to eat this holiday season, your table may include an extra serving of Georgia state pride. Under a new law passed by the state Legislature earlier this year, two new dishes have become official state symbols, and the fourth Friday in November will be celebrated as “National Sugarcare Syrup Day.”
House Bill 233, introduced by Rep. Rick Townsend, a Brunswick Republican, designates Brunswick stew the official state stew of Georgia. The dish is generally made with a tomato-based sauce, beans, vegetables and meat — these days, most recipes call for chicken or pulled pork, but traditional Brunswick stew was historically made with small game meat, such as rabbit or squirrel.
Both Brunswick, Georgia and Virginia’s Brunswick County claim credit for the invention of the stew, in a rivalry that is unlikely to be settled by the passage of Georgia’s bill.
“Contrary to claims by other states, Georgia, and specifically Brunswick, Georgia, is the  birthplace of Brunswick stew,” the bill states.

Brunswick is also home to the annual Brunswick Rockin’ Stewbilee, which brings together stew lovers for a cooking competition, complete with live music, a car show, and a 5K race.
Ron Adams, one of the event’s founders and a longtime competitor, said that while there is a longstanding rivalry between the states, “it’s all been done, always with tongue in cheek and always in good fun, and nobody takes it too seriously.”
There are also a few regional differences between the two states’ versions of the stew, namely that Georgia’s Brunswick stew often contains pork, and tends to be chunkier than Virginian Brunswick stew. But at the end of the day, Adams added, each recipe is unique to the chef who cooks it.
“Brunswick stew has as many recipes as there are cooks,” he said.
Townsend’s legislation also includes a proposal from Rep. Kasey Carpenter to establish cornbread as the official state bread. 
Carpenter, a restaurant owner, said the variety of cornbread styles and flavors makes for a versatile, crowd-pleasing dish.
“There’s a lot of different flavors out there for people,” the Dalton Republican said. “Some people like jalapeños, some people like it sweet. The traditionalists don’t like it sweet. It’s pretty interesting, the diversity that’s out there.”
Though there was a small contingent of lawmakers who were vying for biscuits to become the state bread, Carpenter said cornbread was the natural choice for him.

“I like biscuits, but most people only eat a biscuit for one meal, people can eat cornbread for lunch and dinner,” he said, adding that cornbread’s Indigenous origins reflect the heritage of many residents of his northwest Georgia district.
“Cornbread has been made in the state of Georgia much longer than biscuits,” he said.
However, the revised bill was not immune from controversy. The Senate’s version included a measure that prevents state agencies from contracting with foreign adversaries such as China, prompting a wave of outcry from some Democrats who argued that the two issues should be addressed separately. 
The bill ultimately passed in a 113-51 vote, and was signed into law by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in May.
Both cornbread and Brunswick stew now join a list of Georgia’s edible symbols that includes Vidalia sweet onions (the official state vegetable), peaches (the official state fruit) and grits (the official state prepared food).
Next course
Lawmakers may have more food-related bills on their plate when they return to the capitol in January for the 2026 legislative session.
House Bill 65, introduced by state Rep. Angela Moore, would make collard greens the official state greens, and establish “potlikka” — a broth made from the boiled greens — as the official dipping sauce of the official state bread. For now though, the Stonecrest Democrat’s bill is stuck in committee. 
Other lingering measures are more serious and seek greater disclosure about the origins of the food we eat. House Bill 163, sponsored by Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley, requires restaurants to inform customers when they’re serving lab-grown or plant-based meat. The bill passed the House, and is awaiting action in the Senate committee.
Another measure, introduced by Savannah Republican Rep. Jesse Petrea, would require restaurants to disclose the country of origin for all imported shrimp served to customers. The bill, House Bill 117, passed in the House but was tabled in the Senate near the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Though areas like Savannah are known for their seafood, reporting from Grist and WABE has found that much of the shrimp served at local restaurants is actually imported from other countries. The bill, Petrea said, is “about saving domestic shrimpers, and it’s about letting consumers know that what they’re eating is imported.”
If the bill is enacted during the 2026 legislative session, Petrea said he hopes coastal Georgia will be able to strengthen its shrimp industry, noting that he has already noticed greater awareness around local shrimp since the bill was introduced earlier this year.
“Just since that time, we’ve seen an improvement in the sale of domestic shrimp in our area,” he said, adding that he expects the bill will cross the finish line next year. 
“I’ve already gotten a commitment from the lieutenant governor that it’ll be a priority,” he said.

Drugs like Ozempic have grown in popularity to treat obesity, prompting more than a dozen states to pay for them. But with major budget pressures, several state Medicaid agencies are either stopping coverage altogether or restricting who can get access to the therapy. (Photo illustration by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Some states are rethinking their coverage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss as budgets tighten and Medicaid programs brace for the cuts included in President Donald Trump’s broad tax and spending law.
As of Oct. 1, 16 state Medicaid programs covered GLP-1s for obesity treatment, up from 13 last year, according to a survey of Medicaid directors by KFF, a health policy research group. But some states have announced they will discontinue coverage or restrict who can qualify for it.
Many doctors and patient advocates say the drugs will save money in the long run by reducing obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Many states, however, have concluded they just can’t afford them.
North Carolina Medicaid ended coverage of GLP-1s for obesity last month, citing shortfalls in state funding. California, New Hampshire and South Carolina have said they will end coverage on Jan. 1. Starting next year, Michigan Medicaid will limit coverage to people who are “morbidly obese.” Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin also are considering new restrictions.
In last year’s KFF survey, about half the states said they were interested in covering GLP-1s for weight loss, according to Elizabeth Williams, a senior policy manager at KFF who focuses on Medicaid. This year, most states are moving in the opposite direction.











This likely reflects recent state budget challenges and the significant, significant costs associated with coverage.


– Elizabeth Williams, KFF senior policy manager



“This likely reflects recent state budget challenges and the significant, significant costs associated with coverage,” Williams said. “After a number of years of robust revenue growth right after the pandemic, states are starting to see slowing revenues, increasing spending demands and a lot of fiscal uncertainty due in part to recent federal actions.”
In April, the Trump administration scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Earlier this month, Trump announced that his administration had reached agreements with the manufacturers of Wegovy and Zepbound to reduce the prices of the drugs for Medicaid, Medicare and consumers buying the drugs directly, But it’s unclear whether the deals will reduce costs for states.
Health plans for state workers also are reassessing their coverage of the drugs for obesity. North Carolina, for example, ended GLP-1 obesity coverage for state workers last year, and West Virginia canceled a 1,000-person pilot program.
GLP-1 medications, which balance blood sugar levels, have long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. All state Medicaid programs, which are funded jointly by the states and the federal government, cover GLP-1s for those uses.
But the drugs also curb hunger signals and can help people lose significant amounts of weight. Medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound have become wildly popular for that purpose.
Between 2019 and 2023, the number of outpatient Medicaid prescriptions for select GLP-1s to treat diabetes and obesity grew from 755,300 to 3.8 million, according to KFF. During the same period, Medicaid spending on those drugs increased from $597.3 million to $3.9 billion.
A study published last year in The BMJ, the journal of the British Medical Association, found that the number of patients without diabetes who started GLP-1 treatment in the United States increased from roughly 21,000 in 2019 to 174,000 in 2023, or more than 700%.
Biden wanted Medicaid to pay for weight-loss drugs. Trump just said it doesn’t have to.

More than 2 in 5 U.S. adults have obesity, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC defines obesity as having a body mass index — a calculated measure of body weight relative to height — of 30 or higher. Obesity costs the U.S. health care system almost $173 billion per year, according to the agency.
Recently, the manufacturers of some GLP-1s have lowered their prices, selling them directly to consumers for $500 or less per month. But many patients cannot afford to pay that much out of pocket.
States in a tough financial position
In North Carolina, Dr. Jennifer McCauley, a weight management physician at UNC Health, said Medicaid coverage of GLP-1s was “incredibly helpful for our patients.”
“Now they’ve stopped coverage, so those people are now going back, regaining some of the weight, because they’re unable to obtain these medications, and also are suffering the health consequences of obesity,” McCauley told Stateline.
Some critics of expansive GLP-1 coverage say it isn’t cost effective, because many patients gain back the weight they lost when they stop treatment. But McCauley said the “downstream effects of obesity are even higher.”
“There are definitely vulnerable populations that probably would not be able to obtain weight loss without these medications.”
James Werner, a spokesperson at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, blamed the coverage change on the state legislature’s failure to budget enough money for Medicaid.
In an email to Stateline, Werner said coverage of GLP1s for weight loss “would be reconsidered if Medicaid is fully funded.”
Some states are trying to maintain at least some coverage of the expensive drugs by tightening the eligibility requirements for a prescription, according to Colleen Becker, a project manager at the National Conference of State Legislatures, a policy research group.
“States are really looking at how to balance access and provide that access to patients, but they’re stewards of their budgets, and they need to be good stewards of it,” Becker said.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states considering such options. Meanwhile, Connecticut has decided to maintain coverage of weight-loss drugs for state employees, but to require beneficiaries to try online weight-loss counseling before they can get a prescription.
Some future possibilities
One state, North Dakota, has taken a different approach to GLP-1 coverage after legislation that would have required the state’s Medicaid program to cover the drug failed. Instead, North Dakota this year became the first state to mandate that insurers on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace cover the drugs for weight loss.
North Dakota Deputy Insurance Commissioner John Arnold said the insurance department calculated that the mandate wouldn’t cause insurance premiums to rise significantly.
“It’s not that anybody can walk into the doctor’s office and say, ‘Hey, I want to have this covered,’” Arnold said. “It is really for those who have a medical need for the drugs, then it would be covered.”
The insurance department had to ask the legislature for permission to make the change, according to North Dakota Republican House Speaker Robin Weisz. He said insurance carriers were concerned that it was going to be “open season for everybody who could lose 20 or 30 pounds.”
He said it will take time to see whether the policy raises insurance premiums.
“If the carriers can come in a couple years and say, ‘Wow, here’s what we’ve spent on these … we’ll take a hard look at it,” Weisz said. “But, it’s way too early to tell at this point.”
Arnold says other states may have the flexibility to consider mandating ACA insurers to cover the drugs.
“Our biggest concern was reducing those comorbidities and the long-term impact that that has on the cost of insurance in general, because more comorbidities means more claims,” Arnold said, referring to diseases and conditions associated with obesity.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Federal grants for Yale research on malaria were cut, but the work continues",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/yale-malaria-research-federal-cuts/,"Federal cuts to research have had real-world effects. But for one Yale researcher, the work has continued with alternative funding sources.","Amy Bei, a professor of epidemiology at Yale University, received the cancellation notice from the federal government on May 1. 
The $300,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health was for the first phase of research into a method for tracking malaria spread through communities. Bei had been finishing up that first phase when the notice came through. 
It wasn’t Bei’s first brush with federal funding cuts to research this year.
In January, she’d received a stop-work order from the federal government for a separate project in the central African country of Chad, where she was helping local laboratories introduce new technologies and build capacity for genomic surveillance across the country. She was told she could keep working temporarily on a limited basis, then she received the official cancellation notice in June. The project was funded through the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. 
Bei’s grants are only two of many at Yale and other Connecticut universities that have been cancelled or paused — or for which funding is expected to run out and not be renewed.
According to Lindsay DiStefano, the University of Connecticut’s interim vice president for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, the school had lost $41 million in cancelled grants and nonrenewals as of mid-October. The university has been able to provide about $1.6 million of its own money in the short term for certain projects, according to DiStefano. 
Michael Crair, Yale’s vice provost for research, said 50 grants had been cancelled as of Aug. 12. An additional 22 were either partially cancelled or ordered to pause, and 14 more were told they would not be receiving future funding. Crair said the cancellations amounted to “tens of millions of dollars” in research funds. 
“The loss of federal funding has delayed, halted, and put at risk research essential to advancing life-saving medical breakthroughs, scientific discovery, humanitarian aid, and technological innovation, among other important work,” Crair wrote in an emailed statement. 
Real-world effects of laboratory cuts
At Yale, Bei has been researching malaria spread in Africa since the early 2000s, when she went to Tanzania to study drug resistance and evaluate potential candidates for malaria vaccines. She said the experience changed her life.

“It really made me realize, this is not just a problem that we’re trying to tackle in a Petri dish, but this is truly a disease that has a just unbelievable toll in communities,” she said. 
Bei said when she began working in the field, the medical interventions to fight malaria were limited, and people were getting very sick. Although there’s been a lot of scientific progress since then, Bei said, the parasite has adapted to evade interventions like vaccines and medications.
“Whether you look at death, you look at morbidity, you look at days lost from school, or days lost from going to work, there’s so many different impacts that malaria has on everything from loss of life to even loss of being able to live and be a productive member of society,” said Bei. 
According to data from the World Health Organization’s 2024 report, Senegal reported about 1.2 million cases of malaria and 200 deaths from the disease in 2023. 
Malaria is a parasite, which makes it particularly challenging to vaccinate against. The parasite goes through different life cycle phases and displays genetic variations, making it difficult to narrow down a single target that can be used to protect against all infections. When it reproduces inside a human being, Bei said, the new parasites can appear differently in the body than the ones the mosquito originally transmitted, making the disease unpredictable for anyone trying to develop a vaccine. 
The biomarkers Bei’s project was researching, which originate in a mosquito’s saliva, have several uses. The presence or absence of certain biomarkers can indicate whether government interventions to prevent malaria spread — for instance, widespread distribution of mosquito nets sprayed with bug repellant — are actually preventing people from being bitten. 
The markers are particularly useful in geographic regions where most people aren’t showing symptoms of malaria, but the disease is still being transmitted, Bei said. As people become accustomed to the parasite, they are able to contract it without experiencing symptoms, hiding the fact that the disease may still be alive and well within particular communities.
“We have these areas of the country, and this has actually happened in Senegal, where you think there’s very little transmission going on, but actually there’s sustained transmission that is just kind of going under the radar, or because people are not coming in in a symptomatic way to clinics, but yet they’re still transmitting the parasite between individuals,” said Bei.  
Bei said a future goal would be to develop biomarkers that can distinguish between different types of mosquitos spreading the parasite.

Finding ways to continue the research
Since the grant cancellations, Bei said she’s gotten funding from the philanthropic arm of Tito’s Handmade Vodka to continue some parts of the NIH-funded work tracking malaria spread. 
Tito’s philanthropic arm and a few internal grants from Yale have also enabled her team to keep up the USAID-funded project in Chad, including a training her lab is offering on using genomic surveillance — observing how parasite genomes evolve in response to malarial interventions — to track malaria. 
Still, the loss of funding was disruptive. 
Natasha Turyasingura, a Ph.D. student from Uganda who is working on the Chad project, said she was planning to travel to Africa this past February to train local researchers in how to use a newly developed DNA sequencing panel to analyze the genetic makeup of malaria parasites found in blood samples that researchers collected from different parts of the country.
With a new vaccine recently available, the scientists were trying to understand ways the parasite might evolve to escape the effects of the vaccine, as well as forms of malaria that don’t appear on diagnostic tests or have become drug-resistant. 
But the U.S. government’s order to stop work on the project postponed the trip by nearly a year, as Bei searched for funding to continue the research. With those funds now secured, they plan to travel to Chad in December.
For Turyasingura, the Trump administration’s new priorities have also hit her personally. The length of her visa was shortened from one year to three months, making it more challenging for her to travel and conduct research outside the U.S. 
Meanwhile, other facets of the project in Chad were thrown into limbo. Efforts to meet with village representatives and community members to educate people about the benefits of vaccination, which were being supported through the USAID grant, are now severely limited. 
Bei also continues to relieve additional NIH funding for an effort to develop a “next generation” malaria vaccine. 
The World Health Organization recently approved two vaccines, one in 2021 and one in 2023, to be used in countries where malaria is widespread. But Bei noted that the vaccines have a low rate of efficacy. According to a 2024 World Health Organization paper, the 2021 vaccine was between 45% and 51% efficient in preventing malaria, and the 2023 vaccine was between 66% and 75% efficient. And that protection decreases over time.  
(By comparison, the vaccine commonly given for measles is 97% effective after two doses.)
Laty Gaye Thiam, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal, which collaborates with Yale on the malaria research, said the vaccine they are developing will attempt to complement existing vaccines by targeting a different stage of the parasite’s life cycle. As part of this work, he said, they are looking at the antibodies produced by people who are immune to the disease and identifying the antigens that those antibodies are responding to, in order to understand what factors are protecting those people from the disease. 
Bei said they planned to combine the research that Thiam and others in the lab are doing with her biomarker research to create a broad “panel” that will give researchers more information about malaria spread. 
Thiam, who is originally from Senegal, said he’s seen firsthand the damage caused by malaria. He’s had it himself several times. 
“Having suffered from that, and also being close to kids and infants that are suffering … from our field work, it is really a devastating disease … You can see that it has a huge impact, not only on the child who is sick, but even the mother or the dad who’s carrying that sick child. You can feel the burden of the disease.” 
Cyrianne Keutcha, a Cameroon native and postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Public Health who works in Bei’s lab in Senegal, said she remembers coming down with malaria around age 11. It was a case severe enough to keep her in the hospital for two weeks.
Keutcha is working with Thiam on the research into next generation malaria vaccines. She is testing whether a potential new malaria vaccine developed in the United Kingdom will be effective against the parasites found in the blood of people who are living in places like Senegal, where malaria is prevalent. Keutcha is looking to see if any natural variations in these parasites can escape the effects of the potential vaccine. The vaccine in the UK is in the early stages of being tested on volunteers. 
Keutcha said that much of the research they were doing on malaria could also be used to understand other diseases, ones that are prevalent in the U.S. 
“You are investing in knowledge that can significantly improve the wellbeing of a group of people that you may not know. However, that same technology can be used to significantly improve your well-being as well for another disease that is to come or that’s already present,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4336-1024x672.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 05:56:41.755994

With those words, Republican candidate for governor Charlotte O’Hara launched into her answer to my question: Why write and publish dozens of personal political columns on her campaign website?
“I think that many candidates speak in platitudes and they don’t speak in specifics,” O’Hara said this week. “That’s a real tradition. Candidates don’t want to dive into how they would approach a problem.”
The earliest versions of her political commentary likely started around 2008, when O’Hara (who was then the 3rd District Republican chairwoman) remembers sending out commentary pieces in a newsletter to state delegates. O’Hara now co-owns an Olathe business that manufactures plastics, including casino poker chips.
Her public life also includes past work as a state representative and Johnson County commissioner.
“When I was a county commissioner, I also did columns,” O’Hara said. “So I mean, this is not just because of the campaign. I think it’s just a great way to communicate with people. Most politicians don’t want to be that open with all of their opinions, but I think that the more that the community knows about you, that’s what you really want. It’s important for people to understand where you’re really coming from.”
O’Hara’s writing is certainly specific. Dozens of columns showcase her conservatism, both fiscal and social.
One headline asks, “Men in Women’s YMCA Locker Rooms?” She kicks off with these lines: “We have been so blessed with beautiful spring days. The season of the world awakening from winter’s rest. Now, if only we would awaken to God’s creation of Adam and Eve.”
In “Why is Kansas the High Tax Point on the Prairie?”, a sentence shows her mix of personal writing and focus on specifics: “As a commissioner, I voted no on giving a Chinese company, Cnano, property tax incentives at New Century AirCenter of 30 cents a sq ft. or approximately 12% of what they should be paying.”
O’Hara told me: “People know who I am. There’s not going to be any doubt about that. I pretty well lay everything out there. I’m not hedging anything when I write about an issue. I put it out there, what I think.”
Poetry and music are also avenues for O’Hara to express herself. She has written and performed seven albums of songs on Spotify, including her favorite song, “Last Lullaby.”
She has collected her poetry into a self-published book, “I Wonder.” Part of a poem she wrote this week includes these lines: “Or doomed are we / To be buried in this deluge / Of illusion’s complexity / And lost from our grasp, / Simplicity.”
O’Hara says that Doug Johnson, a political friend, edits her columns. She calls him “a political buddy. We have been in the trenches of politics for the last 30 years.”
Political cartoons accompany each column. O’Hara’s friend Tim McCabe provides caricatures (see Gov. Laura Kelly with blue hair and rainbow pride earrings) and symbolism (see Panasonic as Jabba the Hut gobbling cash) at the top of each page.
The bombastic combination of commentary and cartoons leaves readers — and voters — with a clear impression. As O’Hara says: “Boy, she’s conservative.”
O’Hara’s commentary appears in a few places: on four pages of her website, through an email list and on her campaign’s Facebook page.
“I think it’s just important that I communicate with the people on Facebook,” she said.
Three hundred and forty days before election day for Kansas governor, most candidates competing with O’Hara have campaign websites. The basic formula is a red, white and blue logo. Plus a bunch of family photos. Plus a few basic planks of your platform.
Some websites are spartan — just a single page. (I’m looking at you, Jeff Colyer.) Learning about the candidate’s political thinking can require watching a campaign video.
O’Hara’s writing puts her more clearly on the record. While I don’t agree with most of her writing, I admire her willingness to explain specific misgivings with how Kansas is being governed.
Sometimes, those positions situate her in an unorthodox political niche. She bemoans tax breaks for companies, which she calls corporate welfare. She blames both Democrats and Republicans for approving these tax incentives.
On the topic of President Donald Trump, O’Hara says the legislative branch needs to reassert itself to maintain power, pushing back on executive actions like the recent tariff increases.
“President Trump loves to consolidate power,” O’Hara said. “That’s just how he operates. And it’s not just him. This has been going on forever, but the Congress needs to be big boys. Put their big boy pants on — or however you want to put it. They need to recognize that they have a responsibility for doing their jobs.”
After writing more than 170 columns for Kansas Reflector, I can struggle to find a weekly topic. In fact, this week I asked two editors at the Reflector for inspiration.
For O’Hara, finding a topic is simple, she says.
“It just seems like that they just show up on my front porch,” O’Hara said. “I am a woman of deep faith, and so I pray a lot. They show up on the front porch, and I start writing about them.”
In fact, O’Hara had advice for me at the end of our interview.
“I would just encourage you to be more on autopilot,” she said. “See where your imagination and your creativity takes you. Instead of just (saying), ‘OK, this is who I’m writing for.’ No, it’s an honesty. This is what I’m thinking. This is an important issue that people need to think about. Here’s a different perspective.”

In the hush before dawn, ordinary men and women declared that kings were notdivine, that power was not sacred, that liberty was not to be begged for but claimed.The Revolution was not merely a war of muskets and tea — it was a covenant ofconscience, a vow that no tyrant would sit enthroned above the human soul.
Yet every generation must renew that vow. For democracy is not a relic secured in marble; it is a flame that must be fed — or it dies.

Carlton Highsmith
And so again, as in every age before, the ancient question rises from the dust: When the powerful demand our silence, do we appease — or do we oppose?
Appeasement always comes dressed in reason. It speaks softly of prudence and patience, of compromise and calm. It promises peace in our time — and delivers ruin in its wake.
In Munich, 1938, a man waved a paper and called it peace. A year later, the world was burning. Chamberlain’s mistake was not political but moral — he mistook cowardice for wisdom, and fear for diplomacy. He believed evil could be reasoned with, that tyranny could be tamed by tenderness. But history is clear: authoritarianism does not bargain. It consumes. And long before Munich, America knew that truth.
When the Kansas-Nebraska Act sought to spread slavery westward, Charles Sumnerrose in the Senate and named appeasement for what it was — “cowardice maderespectable.” For his words, he was beaten nearly to death, yet his voice still echoes while his assailant’s name has turned to dust.
In every age, moral clarity is punished before it is praised. When fear swept through the 1950s and Sen. Joseph McCarthy hunted ghosts, it was the courage of journalists and citizens — not the comfort of the crowd — that saved the nation’s soul. Edward R. Murrow stood before the camera’s eye and declared, “We cannot defendfreedom abroad by deserting it at home.”
And when Martin Luther King Jr. was told to wait, to quiet his march toward justice,he answered from a Birmingham jail that the greatest threat to liberty was not the Klansman’s rage, but the moderate’s silence — that “negative peace” which prefersorder to righteousness.
These are not shadows of the past; they are reflections in the mirror we face today.Once more, the drumbeat of authoritarianism sounds — this time cloaked in flags,cheered on by cynicism. We are told dissent is disloyal. That truth is a matter of opinion. That judges are political, the press deceitful, elections corrupt. That the Constitution is too fragile for the moment it built.
But let us remember: Silence is not prudence — it is surrender. Democracy does not collapse in a single blow; it decays through a thousand small surrenders. Tyranny does not storm the gates; it seeps beneath them.
It begins with the normalization of lies, the ridicule of truth-tellers, the corrosion oflaw, and the soft numbing of the public conscience. It seduces the weary with promises of safety, simplicity, and greatness — and in exchange, steals the very freedoms that make greatness possible.
The Constitution was never written to protect the powerful. It was written torestrain them.
James Madison warned that “ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”Our duty, then, is not to obey — it is to resist when obedience becomes complicity.Reinhold Niebuhr reminded us that evil cannot be disarmed by politeness, onlyconfronted by courage. Appeasement is not humility — it is the quiet betrayal of justice dressed in civility’s robe.
History’s verdict is unwavering: democracy survives not by the silence of thecautious, but by the courage of the convicted. It dies not from one great blow, but from the slow corrosion of conscience.
The patriots of 1776 were branded traitors before they were hailed as founders. The marchers of Selma were called agitators before they were canonized as heroes. Courage is always condemned before it is celebrated.
Appeasement offers comfort for a day, regret for a lifetime. Opposition demands sacrifice now — but bequeaths freedom to the generations. The question before us is no longer philosophical. It is moral. It is urgent.
The threat to democracy is not distant — it is domestic. It creeps in through cynicism, apathy, and fear. And so the duty falls, as it always has, to those who still believe — who still dare to speak when silence feels safe.
Let us, then, be counted among them. Let us answer history’s summons not with resignation, but with resolve. Let us rise — not in anger, but in allegiance to the idea that birthed this nation: that free people must never bow to fear. To appease is to abandon. To oppose is to affirm. Silence has never guarded liberty.
Every right we hold dear — to speak, to vote, to worship, to dissent — waspurchased not by the timid, but by the defiant.
The eyes of history are upon us now. The test is before us. And the verdict — as ever — will be written not by our intentions, but by our courage.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The holiday light show at Montgomery County’s Brookside Gardens is open for about a month and a half. But preparing for the show, which involves 1.5 million twinkling lights, is pretty much a year-round affair.
Practically right after each year’s show finishes in early January, staff members are already thinking about the next iteration of the popular event, said Jeff Patterson, the facilities and grounds manager at the garden.
“We’ll have a wrap-up meeting, and then [it’s]: What do you want to do for next year?” said Patterson, who’s in his 24th year setting up the show.
Brookside Gardens is not alone. Throughout the state, drive-through and walk-through light shows have become winter holiday mainstays that require hundreds of man-hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up every year.

In Maryland, popular shows take over parks, gardens, fairgrounds and farmland, beginning some time around Thanksgiving and extending past Christmas and often into the New Year.
The coronavirus pandemic reportedly boosted the concept’s popularity, with stir-crazy quarantined Marylanders eager for outdoor activities that allowed for social distancing.
The Garden of Lights show at Brookside, which is set up by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, has drawn 44,000 visitors each year, on average, dating back to 2022. Before that, tickets were sold per car, rather than per person, making prepandemic comparisons difficult. But anecdotally, COVID provided a boost, Patterson said.
“It increased visitation for a few years, for sure,” he said.
During a recent workday, with the show just a few weeks away, workers used zip ties to affix lights to a large tunnel, decorated to look like a caterpillar, that visitors will walk through near the visitor center. A second crew assembled another tunnel of lights in the yew garden, on the other side of the 50-acre garden within Wheaton Regional Park.
For the Brookside show, which opened Nov. 21, the design work begins in January, after which materials are ordered and then an in-house welder assembles the metal structures the hold the lights.
Patterson said the crew makes slight modifications to the show each year, largely adding more and more attractions, based on what set-ups are popular with attendees. Last year, the team added a group of pink flamingos near a lake in the gardens, Patterson said.
“That was a huge hit,” Patterson said. “So, this year we added palm trees and a whole bunch of other stuff out there.”
Producing this year’s show included a bit of a wrinkle: Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump (R) on goods entering the U.S. from China and other nations drove up prices on the raw materials and light bulbs that have to be purchased for the displays in the early part of the year. Patterson said prices changed so frequently that staffers had to check repeatedly before making purchases.

“We have price limits on what we can spend, being a government agency,” Patterson said. “So, we had to cut back some on supplies, because we had to pay a tariff. And that — I’d never seen that before. So, instead of buying 20 lights, we were going to buy 18 lights, because we had to pay that extra money in tariffs.”
The show’s overall budget is in the hundreds of thousands each year, Patterson said. Admission is $13.99 Sunday through Thursday and $16.99 on Fridays and Saturdays. Children 5 and under are free.
At Brookside, a crew of about a dozen seasonal workers begins assembling the displays in August, first putting together the metal silhouettes for the lights, and then shortly thereafter pulling the lights from four shipping containers, where they are organized by color.
During the off-season, some of the larger metal forms are stored beneath tall roof structures, including a giraffe and tall trees.
“It keeps adding and adding as the show keeps growing,” he said.
The show has also changed over the years. First came the transition to LED lights from incandescent bulbs, a time-intensive process that took place around 2015, Patterson said.
“It took us quite a few years to get all the forms done, because they were all incandescent,” Patterson said. “You have our giraffe, which has the most lights on it, that took three weeks to strip and redo.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The next big thing is displays that are controlled through cellphone apps, which spurred another transition for the staff at Brookside.
“That was a struggle at first — the learning curve of: ‘Oh, we have to get WiFi in the garden now to run all these things,” Patterson said.
The light show is hardly Patterson’s only job. As grounds manager, he also oversees irrigation, custodial crews and more. But it has become a significant part of his day-to-day.
“It’s a huge undertaking, and it takes almost every section here to make it work, from advertising to budgeting to all of our banners and signage we have to put up, and online ads,” Patterson said.

Library of CongressNine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.

But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

The lawsuit said the new guidance would eliminate eligibility for legal immigrants who had previously been eligible to receive such benefits, including those who had been granted asylum or refugee status.
The guidance, issued at the end of October, was intended to provide instructions on how to implement program changes passed in July as a part of H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowed eligibility for noncitizens.
“The guidance in reality goes beyond the act, arbitrarily excluding from SNAP many lawful permanent residents who remain eligible under the statutory scheme established by Congress,” the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Oregon Eugene Division said.
Nothing in the bill, the filing continues, would prohibit individuals who were at one point refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees, now groups no longer eligible for SNAP, from gaining eligibility for the program if and when they gain status as lawful permanent residents. 
“The law is clear on who can receive SNAP benefits, yet the Trump Administration is trying to strip rightful recipients of the support they need to feed their families,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. “It is my hope that the Court puts an end to this unlawful guidance and stops the White House’s ongoing chaos and confusion over Americans’ ability to put food on the table.”
The lawsuit is seeking an injunction to the changes that would prevent states from implementing the eligibility changes in question.
Nessel and 20 other attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last week asking for clarification on the new guidance, but they did not receive a response from Rollins.
The lawsuit also alleges that the U.S. Department of Agriculture misapplied its own rules on new regulations about SNAP error rates within states — the legislation passed in July gave a 120-day window for states to address their error rates, but the guidance issued in October stated that the window for that exclusionary period would end on Nov. 1 — a Saturday, one day after the guidance was issued. 
The calculation was done based on the day of the passage of the bill initially, not when the guidance was issued, which Nessel and the other attorneys general argue is incorrect based on federal laws.
