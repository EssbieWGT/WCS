Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, presents Senate Bill 4, an act relating to sick leave for members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, during a meeting of the Senate State and Local Government Committee. (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A longtime Republican lawmaker who will not seek reelection next year still has a few policies he wants to check off before leaving office. 
In a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, 72, said he’s happy to leave at a career peak in his time as a lawmaker, but he has a few transportation priorities he wants to address during his final legislative session in 2026. 
Announcing his decision to not seek reelection last week, Higdon said spending more time with his family was a key factor in his decision. The Lebanon Republican told the Lantern that he anticipates quality candidates will run for the 14th Senate District seat, which represents LaRue, Marion, Nelson, Spencer and Washington counties. Higdon was elected to the Senate in 2009. Before that, he was in the House beginning in 2003.
“I think part of leadership is knowing when to say when and to pass the torch,” Higdon said. “I’ve seen too many of my colleagues stay too long, and I don’t want to be that guy.”
Higdon is the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, which often debates infrastructure projects across Kentucky. During his last session, he hopes to introduce a comprehensive bill that would “modernize Kentucky’s transportation system.” Higdon said issues he wants to address include changing the state’s fuel formula tax and introducing a user fee for commercial electric vehicles. 
Separate from that, Higdon is passionate about reducing distracted driving in Kentucky. Texting while driving already is illegal in Kentucky. The legislation he has in mind would go beyond that. Higdon has worked on iterations of the legislation in the past, but they haven’t made it through the General Assembly. A bill he co-sponsored this year would have prohibited drivers from using personal communication devices in ways that require the driver to reach for the device or press more than one button to activate it. 
Whenever Higdon sees a report of a car accident, he said he asks himself if it could have been prevented with such a law. 
He anticipates some pushback, particularly by those who would argue the bill would create a “nanny state,” but he wants to trudge on. 
“Driving is not a right, it’s a privilege and we need to keep our roads safe,” Higdon said.

Another transportation issue that has made headlines over the summer are Kentucky’s regional driver’s licensing offices, which the legislature created in 2020 to replace offices in each county. Earlier this year, the Transportation Cabinet revoked 1,985 driver’s licenses because of irregularities. A whistleblower alleges that workers in a regional office in Louisville were supplying driver’s licenses to immigrants who were not eligible to receive them in exchange for $200.
Higdon said he is helping another Republican lawmaker, Sen. Aaron Reed of Shelbyville, craft legislation. Higdon added that he supports local offices having the ability to oversee some processes, like issuing renewal licenses and permit testing to eliminate lines at regional offices and save people in rural communities a long commute to run an errand. 
“We know there needs to be something done. It’s probably not going to be a full overhaul. I think we would go back to square one, and we’re just not ready for that right now,” Higdon said. “It needs to be well thought out, well planned.”
Higdon’s committee also often discusses recovery and repairs following natural disasters. In recent years, Kentucky has been the site of devastating tornadoes and floods that have caused damage to roads, bridges and other structures. 
Kentucky has “plenty experience” with disasters, Higdon said, adding that lawmakers have set aside extra funding in the state budget to address any unforeseen circumstances. He also commended the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s response under Secretary Jim Gray. 
At the national level, FEMA has come under scrutiny as President Donald Trump has floated the idea of dismantling the federal agency and moving its responsibilities back to the states. 
Higdon said that he agrees with the idea that states’ emergency response teams can oversee immediate response as local teams often know communities better. However, he does think that states need federal funding to help rebuild after disasters. 
“We need that money from the federal government, too, for that recovery and that type of help,” Higdon added. 
Higdon has also made headway with Republicans on pension policies in the last few years. He is a co-chair of the Public Pension Oversight Board. He said his biggest accomplishment was getting leaders, staff and the General Assembly to more thoroughly vet and analyze the impact on the state budget before approving changes to public pensions —  “to understand and to have policies in place that we don’t do shortcuts on pensions.” Higdon argued that shortcuts  in the past led to problems now. 
Some of those policies include having the legislation fully go through the process. Also any pension bill must be vetted by the oversight board and have an actuarial analysis. 
‘A friend’
Higdon’s colleagues in the Senate noted his friendship and willingness to listen. In a statement about Higdon’s decision to not seek reelection, Republican Senate President Robert Stivers called Higdon a “a trusted colleague and a steady hand in the Senate.” 
“Most of all, he’s been a friend. His leadership on transportation, pensions, judicial matters, veterans’ issues, and numerous other areas has made an undeniable difference for Kentucky, and he will leave a lasting legislative legacy deeply woven into the fabric of this commonwealth,” Stivers said. 
Across the aisle, Louisville Democratic Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong said she has always enjoyed working with Higdon and appreciated him discussing how decisions about transportation projects are made during her first year in office. She is a new member of the transportation committee. 
“I do think he does a really good job of listening to members about what the needs are in their community and being fair about how he is allocating resources to different types of projects,” Chambers Armstrong added. 
Higdon said he found mentoring newcomers to the legislature enjoyable and that they were often grateful for the help. He encouraged his colleagues to do that after he leaves office. 
He also had some parting advice for fellow Republicans: “Just do the right thing for the right reasons, and the rest of it will take care of itself.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/higdon020724-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 05:58:23.578231

(Photo by Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)Virginia has outpaced the national average in Medicaid spending, an analysis of data by groups of pharmacists found. The state agency that oversees Medicaid benefits have countered that the group’s report is based on “inaccurate” data that it is working to correct.
Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency and Strategic DirectionsRX conducted an analysis of state Medicaid prescription drug spending between 2017 and 2023. It found that Virginia has spent between $1,000 more to $1 million more than the national average in recent years. 
Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), contracts with Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) to manage the benefits of Medicaid enrollees. The MCOs then contract with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). The PBMs act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs also retain rebates and discounts from contracts but some consumers and pharmacies have said they are unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. 
That question often stems from the fact that some MCOs and PBMs are vertically integrated — meaning that they’re part of a larger company that owns health care facilities, pharmacies or health systems. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced this week that his office is investigating some entities to ensure that insulin prices, a critical drug for managing diabetes, was not artificially inflated in violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act.

This year, lawmakers also passed legislation to create a single state-contracted PBM to handle Medicaid in Virginia and Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed it. 
The goal, supporters said, is to increase transparency, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. Virginia’s next gubernatorial administration will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of that law. The PBM reform law was one of the proposed solutions outlined in the pharmacists’ report, and one of its authors supported the bill during this year’s legislative session. 
“When (rebates) gets passed around through companies that have multiple arms that manage multiple parts of the flow of this money, that’s when you start seeing prices go way up,” said Jeremy Counts, a Blacksburg-area pharmacist who worked on the analysis for the report. 
The new report indicates that Virginia’s Medicaid prescription drug plans are returning 20% of gross drug spending back to Medicaid through manufacturer rebates. The national average is about 68%, for comparison, the report read. 
“The state is being charged a very high price for generic medications,” Counts added. 
By “moving to a system that isn’t controlled by the MCOs and their PBMs” the state can set different reimbursement rates, he said. Counts also suggested this could help take burdens off pharmacies, which have experienced more closures. 
The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, is a national benchmark for prescription drug prices – both generic and brand-name — and is developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This represents the average price pharmacies pay for drugs from wholesalers and is a national standard other payers use to set reimbursement rates. 
The math of the solution, Counts explained on a call, is to calculate the NADAC rate of a drug plus whatever the state’s dispensing fee is. Even without the PBM reform bill, he suggested that DMAS could order MCOs to rework their NADAC models. 
“That makes your pharmacies break even,” Counts said. 
 DMAS reporting errors

In light of Counts’ revelations, DMAS said Thursday that he had worked with data that stemmed from an error the agency is already working on correcting. The agency said they alerted Counts about the incorrect data “prior to him publishing the analysis.” 
In a statement to The Mercury, DMAS shared that the department is working to correct the data and resubmit it “as soon as possible” and that it is undertaking a General Assembly-directed study of its pharmacy delivery system.
DMAS also shared a letter it recently wrote to Counts where Virginia Health and Human Services secretary Janet Kelly noted an error that caused DMAS to “significantly overreport pharmacy spending to CMS beginning in 2019.”
It was flagged by Dels. Kieth Hodges, R-Middlesex and Otto Wachsmann, R-Brunswick — both of whom have pharmacy backgrounds. Though Counts’ report was already complete by Sep. 4, this is when DMAS informed him that he’d worked with numbers they are working to fix. 
“DMAS is actively working to rectify the reporting error and agency leadership has offered to provide the corrected information to Pharmacists United for Truth & Transparency as soon as it is verified and available,” Kelly wrote. 
Counts said the organizations “stand by our report” but that they “remain committed to working with Secretary Kelly and DMAS.” 
“We hope to hear from her office soon so we may continue to work cooperatively for the betterment of Commonwealth citizens,” Counts wrote on behalf of the organizations.

On Sept. 16, 1663, the Virginia General Assembly passed Act XIV, establishing Sept. 13 as a perpetual holiday to commemorate the suppression of the Gloucester Conspiracy. Although this holiday was soon forgotten, it is worth considering its reinstatement, for reasons that differ significantly from those originally intended.
The Gloucester Conspiracy, also known as the Servant’s Plot or the Poropotank Servant’s Revolt, is one of the earliest and most significant uprisings involving enslaved individuals and indentured servants in colonial Virginia. This event culminated in several arrests for treason, and the execution and beheading of four individuals.
This plot followed only two years after the York County Conspiracy of 1661, where 40 servants conspired to revolt under their enslaver, Maj. James Goodwin. Although quickly suppressed with no arrests, the York conspiracy demonstrated the growing discontent among Virginia’s indentured labor force and prompted the General Assembly to pass two acts mandating better treatment of servants and the enslaved.
The Gloucester plot comprised a diverse group of English, Irish, African, and Indian indentured servants and enslaved people, even convict laborers transported from British jails, making it one of the first instances of multi-ethnic collaboration in colonial resistance.
The conspiracy transpired on Sept. 1, 1663, when John Gunter, William Bell, Richard Darbishire, John Hayte, Thomas Jones, William Ball, William Poultey, William Bendell, and Thomas Collins secretly met at Peter Knight’s home near Cooks Quarter. The conspirators appointed Bell and Gunter as their leaders. The group agreed to reconvene at midnight the following Sunday, Sept. 6, at Poplar Spring, with each participant ordered to bring whatever weapons they could beg, scavenge or steal for the uprising.
The plan was to march from Poplar Spring first to the home of Lt. Colonel Francis Willis, a member of the governor’s council. There they intended to seize more weapons and demand their release from indentures. A potential second destination was the Green Spring home of Gov. William Berkeley, where they would demand that all indentured servants who were normally required to serve seven years of indenture be released after one year. Many wanted to kill Beverley and Willis if they refused to cooperate.
As with many colonial-era insurrections, such as Gabriel’s Rebellion, an infiltrator betrayed the Gloucester plot. John Birkenhead, a servant of Maj. John Smith, revealed the plan to  Berkeley, who arranged for the conspirators to be ambushed during their gathering at Poplar Spring. Citing divine intervention, the governor said it was “God’s hands” that had delivered “so transcendent a favour as the preserving all we have from so utter ruin.”
With the plot foiled, the nine captured conspirators faced trial for high treason before the General Court in Williamsburg, marking the first time colonial authorities treated servant rebellion as an act of war rather than merely a labor dispute. Determined to make examples of the servants, the court accused them of attempting “utterly to deprive, depose, cast downe and disinherite” the governor. Additionally, the conspirators were charged with planning to wage war against Virginia to “wholy submit and destroy” the still fledgling colony.
The harsh sentences reflected the court’s determination to send a simple but definitive message about the consequences of insurrection. Robert Beverley Jr. wrote in 1705 that four of the nine convicted conspirators—Bell, Gunter, and two unnamed—were executed by hanging. In addition, some historical accounts note that “several bloody heads dangled from local chimney tops as a gruesome warning to others.”
For his betrayal, Birkenhead gained his freedom from indentured servitude and received 5,000 pounds of tobacco, a substantial amount that represented years of earnings for most colonists.
The General Assembly thus voted to make Sept. 13 (presumably the day the final depositions were taken) a perpetual holiday: “Resolved that the 13th of September be annually kept holy, being the day those villains intended to put the plot in execution.” Also, in 1670,  Berkeley issued an order prohibiting Britain’s worst criminals from being imported to Virginia, citing “the horror yet remaining amongst us of the barbourous designe of such villaines in September 1663.”
Virginia should reassess the historical significance of Sept. 13 by reclaiming the date not as a commemoration of colonial authority’s suppression of rebellion, but as a day to honor the resistance, courage, and aspirations of those who, despite overwhelming odds, sought to break free from bondage and assert their humanity. Honoring these individuals would affirm the state’s commitment to a more inclusive and truthful telling of its history.

(Photo by Susan Tebben, Ohio Capital Journal.)With the introduction of a Democratic-proposed map and the announcement of a bipartisan committee on the subject, Ohio lawmakers have officially begun the process of congressional redistricting. So what happens now?
Ohio is restarting its congressional redistricting process, not because of any special push from leadership or even a response to a spontaneous redraw.
Ohio is making a new congressional map because they are legally bound to, as a consequence of a lack of bipartisan agreement in 2022, the last time congressional maps were adopted in the state.
To have maps for the 2026 election, the legislature is starting again.
How redistricting works
Redistricting has been a topic of conversation in Ohio for many years. In 2020, the U.S. Census conducted its official population survey, a landmark time when redistricting happens across the country.
The number of districts that are drawn for both state legislative districts and congressional ones are based on the population shifts recorded in the census conducted every 10 years.
The political leanings of those districts is in theory supposed to come from the voting trends of the state and country.
The GOP-created congressional districts approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission on March 2, 2022.
Congressional district mapmakers often look to the most recent presidential elections for help in how those districts should be shaped.
Republicans currently control 10 of 15 of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional district seats, or 66%. Ohio voted for President Trump in 2024 with 55% of the vote.
The Republican majority that leads the legislature has argued that the 66% Republican majority that was adopted in the March 2022 congressional map represents the political makeup of the state.
Amid a national gerrymandering frenzy, prominent Republicans have called for the party to take two or three more seats. Meanwhile, Ohio Democrats have proposed a map that would lean eight seats Republican to seven seats Democratic, a 53-47 split.
The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, a national analysis of all redistricting efforts, gave the current 10-5 split map an overall “D” grade, with its lowest marks given in partisan fairness.
Democrats unsurprisingly disagreed that the map aligned with the views of the voters, and have maintained that disagreement through their new map proposal introduced on Tuesday.
What the Ohio Constitution says
The district redrawing process is laid out in an amendment to the Ohio Constitution passed by voters in 2018 with nearly 75% support, which spells out not only deadlines for the process, but also how the maps should look once the lines are drawn.
The drawing of congressional districts and legislative districts has certain standards, but some “mandatory standards” for statehouse districts are “general standards” for congressional districts, according to a legislative brief on the process.
For congressional districts, the general standards for a map include contiguity, or districts with “a single, unbroken shape, with no ‘islands’ of territory that do not touch the rest of the district.”
The districts should also be compact and keep counties, townships and municipal corporations whole as much as possible.
“Splitting a political subdivision is necessary when, for example, its population exceeds the ideal district population,” the Legislative Service Commission wrote in its analysis of the redistricting process.
Next steps and deadlines
A joint committee on congressional redistricting has announced they will meet for the first time on Sept. 22. A time and location has not been announced by legislative leadership.
The legislature has until Sept. 30 to approve a congressional map following the constitutional rules. That map must have approval of three-fifths of both chambers of the legislature, including at least half the Democrats.

During consideration of the map proposals by the legislature, proposals are assigned bill numbers, and a committee will hold public hearings on the bills before they can be sent to the full chamber for a vote.
Advocates across the state are hoping the General Assembly will keep to the constitution in holding a transparent process that allows the public time to review maps before they’re voted on, and provide public input.
“You don’t get a fair map without a fair process,” said Bria Bennett, a spokesperson for the Equal Districts Coalition, in a statement. “Closed-door drafting, limits on public testimony and ignored constitutional criteria are not routine politics; they’re power grabs that cheat Ohio voters out of fair representation in Congress.”
Without bipartisan approval, the legislature can’t pass a map, and if the deadline passes without agreement, the process moves on to the Ohio Redistricting Commission.
The seven-person commission is made up of mostly majority party members, as dictated by the redistricting constitutional amendment.
The Senate president, House speaker, Senate minority leader, and House minority leader can all choose to serve on the commission or appoint another member of their chamber to serve.
The governor, auditor, and secretary of state are all required to be on the commission.
With the current make-up of statewide officeholders, this means the Ohio Redistricting Commission has a 5-2, Republican-to-Democratic split.
Public hearings should be held by the commission as well on any proposed maps, before their deadline of Oct. 31.
The rules state the group must also come up with bipartisan support to adopt a new map.
A lack of agreement in the commission means the process goes back to the legislature, who has a final deadline of Nov. 30 to come up with a congressional map.
This time, while the legislature has to follow specific constitutional rules to do so, the legislature can pass a map with a simple majority, rather than the 66% needed in the original attempt.
In order to pass a map with a simple majority, the congressional districts “must not unduly favor or disfavor a political party or its incumbents,” lawmakers are prohibited from improperly splitting counties, townships and municipal corporations, and the General Assembly “must attempt, but is not required, to draw districts that are compact,” according to a Legislative Service Commission brief.
The 6-1 Republican Ohio Supreme Court has jurisdiction over any legal challenges to the map that may happen after it’s passed.
Both previous congressional maps were challenged, and both maps were found by a previous bipartisan 4-3 court majority to be unconstitutionally partisan, favoring the Republicans more than aligned with voting trends.
The makeup of justices on the state’s highest court has changed since then, and now holds a firm Republican majority of 6 to 1.
The Republican swing vote in both the previous congressional redistricting decisions was Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, who has since retired. Current Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy was on the court for those cases and voted to reject the challenges.
If the congressional plan should get struck down as unconstitutional, the legislature has 30 days to adopt a new plan after appeals have been exhausted.
If the legislature still can’t agree or misses the deadline, the Ohio Redistricting Commission is once again brought in with another 30-day deadline.

(Getty Images)About a third of the parking lot of the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua spills over into Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. It’s a geographical quirk that means if shoppers park in the southern lot near the JCPenny or Buffalo Wild Wings, they could find themselves crossing state lines multiple times during their visit. 
But for the attorneys general of New Hampshire and 24 other Republican-led states, it’s a novelty that highlights what they say is a problem with Massachusetts’ gun laws. 
A New Hampshire resident who might be legally carrying a firearm on the New Hampshire side of the parking lot might find that same firearm illegal to carry to the Massachusetts side without a permit.
The 25 states say that arrangement is unconstitutional. This month, they’re taking that argument to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“If that person is carrying a firearm without a Massachusetts license — which would be constitutionally protected activity in most of the mall — that person risks being charged as a felon and facing mandatory incarceration in Massachusetts,” reads a brief from the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Supreme Court, speaking about a visitor to the Pheasant Lane Mall. 
Led by New Hampshire, the states have come together to support the efforts of Philip Marquis, of Rochester, New Hampshire, to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to protect non-Massachusetts residents from the Bay State’s firearms regulations. In an amici — or “friend of the court” — brief, lawyers at the New Hampshire Department of Justice say Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law should not apply to travelers from other states passing through.
Also joining the amici brief are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  
The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, asserts the law can apply to visitors and is constitutional. And the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has agreed. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, the conservative majority could apply a landmark 2022 decision that limited state firearms regulations to rule in favor of Marquis. And the result could dramatically change relations between gun-owning New Hampshire residents and those of its southern neighbor.
But the Supreme Court has been hesitant to take up challenges to gun laws in recent years that could help clarify its 2022 decision. And that has meant a backlog of cases against state firearm restrictions — and potentially the Marquis case — have been left unresolved recently, according to Joseph Blocher, a law professor and co-founder of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.
“I think the pressure is high on the Supreme Court to weigh in again. But they have not,” Blocher said in an interview. “They did not show much of an appetite for it for most of the last 20 years.”
Marquis previously brought a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the state’s court system, arguing that the state’s concealed carry firearms permit law is unnecessarily burdensome to out-of-state visitors. In March, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his claims and ruled that the state law passed constitutional muster. 
Now, Marquis is requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the Massachusetts high court’s decision on federal constitutional grounds. In order for that to happen, the federal court must grant Marquis a “writ of certiorari,” which would allow them to accept arguments and hold an oral hearing.
For Marquis, the effort is personal; he is trying to overturn a conviction. In 2022, Marquis was driving on Interstate 495 when he got into an accident and pulled his car into the breakdown lane, according to his legal petition. At the time, he had an unloaded pistol in his pocket. When state police officers arrived to talk to him, Marquis announced that he had the pistol and removed it from his pocket. 
He told police officers that he did not have a Massachusetts firearm license, but that he is legally allowed to carry a concealed firearm in New Hampshire because he has not been disqualified under federal law. New Hampshire state law allows the automatic concealed carry of firearms for anyone not federally disqualified; Massachusetts requires residents and non-residents to obtain a license by paying $100 and receiving approval from the colonel of the state police.
Because he was carrying the gun without a license, police charged Marquis with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition under Massachusetts state law, and a lower court convicted him.
Marquis has appealed that decision all the way to the highest Massachusetts court, and in doing so he’s invoked a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that has upended state firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Police Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the court struck down a New York law that required residents to show “proper cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit. 
In that decision, the court held that any state law that awards firearms permits on a discretionary basis, known as a “may issue” permitting law, is unconstitutional; only a law that awards permits on strict criteria — a “shall issue” permitting law — could be constitutional under the Second Amendment. And Bruen established that any state firearms restriction must adhere to the historical tradition of firearms regulation dating back to the passage of the Constitution — or be explicitly covered by the Second Amendment itself. 
Now, as Marquis attempts to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, his challenge of the Massachusetts law could represent an opportunity for the court to expand the range of gun rights in the wake of the Bruen decision and limit Massachusetts’ regulatory power.
Neither Marquis nor the Republican attorneys general supporting his lawsuit are attempting to overturn Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law as it applies to Massachusetts residents. But they are seeking to establish that the law should not apply to out-of-state residents whose home states have less restrictive regulations.
And to do it, they are attempting to show that the state law violated Marquis’ Second Amendment right to bear arms and 14th Amendment right to travel and equal protection — and that, following Bruen, no historical reading of those amendments justifies applying Massachusetts’ law to out-of-state residents.
In their briefs, attorneys for Marquis and attorneys for the Republican states argue the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was wrong to decide that the state’s concealed carry permit law qualifies as a “shall issue” permitting law under Bruen. In reality, they say, the decision-making by the state police colonel makes the process a “may issue,” and thus unconstitutional.
In its March ruling, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Marquis did not have standing to sue in Massachusetts court, but that even if he did, his challenge of the state law would not succeed. The court found that the state law passed the Bruen test because it attempts to restrict dangerous people from obtaining firearms, which it held follows historical tradition.  
“To the extent that the Commonwealth restricts the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms within its borders, the justification for so doing is credible, individualized evidence that the person in question would pose a danger if armed,” the state court’s decision read. “Both case law and the historical record unequivocally indicate that this justification is consistent with ‘the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.’”
Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, disagrees. The Cato Institute, a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights, has also filed an amicus brief in Marquis’ petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, in which it argues that a contextual reading of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, indicates that its framers would have intended it to protect the firearms rights of freed slaves traveling to safer states.
“If you’ve been enslaved in Alabama, you sure want to get out of there and go and look for better economic opportunities in other states,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Now, you’re most certainly going to encounter the (Ku Klux Klan) at some point while you’re looking for work in other states. And guess what? You’re going to want to be able to be able to protect yourself, and not have to encounter some state regulation like they have in Massachusetts.” 
It is not clear whether the court will take up Marquis’ appeal, nor when it might make its decision. Despite its decision in Bruen, the conservative court has held back from dramatically expanding the scope of the Second Amendment. In 2024, it narrowed the scope of Bruen‘s in U.S. v. Rahimi, which affirmed the constitutionality of firearm restrictions for defendants in domestic violence case. But it has declined to take up a number of attempts to challenge state firearms restrictions in Democratic-led states, including two cases in Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Crowder and Zemene v. Commonwealth. 
To Blocher, of the Center for Firearms Law, the question of whether Bruen negates out-of-state firearms license requirements is just one of many legal questions that have emerged in caselaw across the country since the 2022 decision. Federal lower courts are grappling with what Bruen means for gun possession by felons; location-based firearm restriction laws such as gun-free school zones; age restrictions; caps on high-capacity magazines; state bans on assault-style rifles; and more. The historical contextual test Bruen requires has at times provided more uncertainty than clarity, he says. And circuit courts are more likely than ever to split along partisan lines.
“It kind of looks like there’s some real confusion and disagreement,” he said. “Some lower courts are even saying, ‘Look, we’re just not equipped to do this kind of historical analysis. We’ve got busy dockets. We’re not like the Supreme Court. We have to decide more than 70 cases every year, and we don’t have the benefits of experts and friend of court briefs, and this is just impossible for us.'”
With scant action from the Supreme Court, the result has been something of a backlog.
Some Second Amendment advocates, like Neily, say the current John Roberts court has failed to follow through on necessary corrections to firearms laws. 
“The court has not manifested a serious commitment to vindicating the right to keep and bear arms, and one of the ways we can see that is in the numerous cases that it has turned away,” Neily said. 
But the string of denials have given hope to supporters of gun restrictions, for whom Bruen had struck a blow in 2022. 
“Even after Bruen, courts are upholding state, federal, and local gun laws against Second Amendment challenges,” a 2023 legal memo from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence states. “Most courts have recognized that, when properly applied, Bruen allows for a wide range of gun violence prevention laws.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gunconcealed-1024x733.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 05:58:23.578231

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/ Stateline)NORTH CONWAY, N.H. — The conversations in French having given them away, the group of motorcyclists immediately stood out as foreigners over a Saturday breakfast in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
In the restaurant, the server was pleased, thanking them for coming. Because these days, tariffs and White House rhetoric have left Canadians a rare breed of visitors in New England, usually a hotspot vacation destination from the nearby province of Quebec.
“There’s a lot of people staying in Canada because of that,” said Dave Gingras, a 35-year-old biker from Saguenay, about two hours north of Quebec City.
While other Canadians are avoiding buying American products or traveling to the States, the group of 11 decided to leave politics behind on their road trip through New England.
“We are just keeping it neutral and trying to enjoy,” Gingras told Stateline.
After breakfast, they donned helmets and mounted an assortment of dusty Yamaha, BMW and Triumph bikes.
“We drive and when we’re tired, we stop and raise up a tent and relax with a beer,” Gingras said before pulling into a line of crawling traffic on the White Mountain Highway, the scenic byway dotted with quaint inns, old-timey stores and Colonial and Victorian homes.
Across Northeastern states, business owners and state officials have labored to maintain key economic connections with Canada despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House. President Donald Trump’s trade war, aggressive immigration enforcement and talk of making their country the 51st state has offended many Canadians. While concerns are acute in New England, tourism hubs from Hawaii to New York are reeling from a decrease in Canadian visitors.
Number of Canadian tourists visiting New Hampshire down 30% this year, officials say

To quell tensions, Maine leaders erected signs in French to welcome Canadian visitors and New Hampshire’s governor just returned from a Canadian trip she took to strengthen trade and tourism.
But hospitality businesses this summer reported a sharp decline in visitors from the North — Canadian travel to New Hampshire is down about 30% this year, according to state officials. Border crossings into Vermont hit their lowest levels since 2021, according to federal data, as the Canadian government reported a 34% drop in the number of August car visits into the U.S. compared with the same month last year.
New England businesses remain concerned as the region turns the page on the summer vacation season to its vibrant autumn, known for luring leaf-peeping travelers from across the globe.

Tourism is vital for White Mountain Valley communities like North Conway. While it’s home to only about 2,300 people, the village is a historic travel hotspot known for outdoor activities, tax-free shopping and family-friendly theme parks.
While many people think of the area as a winter ski destination, summers are actually the largest travel draw, said Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mt. Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce.
The drop in Canadian tourism has been especially evident during less popular travel times for Americans. For example, Canada’s Victoria Day, a late May holiday celebrating that queen’s birthday, has traditionally brought big crowds to the Northeast.
“Our retail outlets are a very, very popular destination for them during that time,” Proulx said. “And our retail outlets have reported that it was basically nonexistent this year.”
Proulx said local businesses have tried to lure travelers from close-by regions like the Boston area to help make up for the loss of Canadian tourists, “so it’s not an unrecoverable loss.” But the absence of visitors from parts North is hard to ignore.
“It almost feels like a birder might feel if they find a rare species,” he said. “If you see someone with a Canadian license plate, you notice it right away. It gives you a little bit of a smile.”
Aside from the economic loss, Proulx said he worries about longstanding relationships.
This scenic valley is nostalgic for many visitors from the U.S. and Canada alike. He said many people return again and again, sharing fond memories of their first camping trip along the Saco River, childhood trips to the Santa’s Village amusement park and picturesque rides on the Conway Scenic Railroad.
“So we just don’t want anybody thinking that they’re not welcomed here. That’s our biggest thing,” he said. “We want everybody to be able to call this their second home, to be able to visit and reconnect and feel welcomed.”
‘Towns are quieter’
In the heart of North Conway, tourists picnic on the grass in Schouler Park, look into the 1874-era train station and meander into shops selling hokey souvenirs and homemade fudge. Framing the village is the imposing Mount Washington, which at 6,288 feet boasts the tallest peak in the Northeast.
At one of the town’s busiest intersections, the crowds come in waves to the North Conway 5&10 Store. But even as families line up, employee Polly Howe said she hadn’t seen many Canadians this summer.
“It’s a shame,” she said, bouncing between the cash register, the candy counter and stocking staples like toys and hats.
In a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the souvenir shop has been around for 86 years and features a false-front facade, the kind made famous in boomtowns of the Old West. Manager Terri Johnson said she had encountered a good number of Canadians inside the shop, but said she didn’t blame any who felt put off by the political climate.
“I’m thankful they still come after all that,” she said.
It’s not just international relations that have changed tourism here.
A rainy start to the summer season didn’t help, and business owners say anxiety over the domestic economy and inflation have pinched travel budgets.

Mark Lahood says family travel has dipped at the three hotels he operates in the area.
“Towns are quieter,” he said this summer. “They’re not quiet, but they’re much quieter than years’ past.”
Some summer weekends, which traditionally sell out entirely, the three hotels had 30% vacancies, he said. And travelers are more keen for weekend trips than their weeklong road trips of previous seasons.
“With a seven-day trip, by the time they were all in, it’s a lot of driving, it’s a lot of gas money, it’s a lot of meals, it’s a lot of hotels,” he said. “And I think it’s just too much.”
To help with rising costs, he ran a free breakfast promotion for kids earlier in the summer. And he increased an existing international discount for Canadian guests.
“Did it help anything? Probably not. But you know, when you view it from a Canadian traveler, at least you made an effort.”
The decline in Canadian visitors has allowed for more local, spontaneous travel, said Genn Anzaldi, who owns J-Town Deli & Country Store in Jackson, New Hampshire.
“More day trippers for sure,” she said. “So maybe not as many people spending the night or as many nights.”
The scent of sizzling bacon and toasting panini fills her shop, which offers hot meals along with handmade gifts and convenience store staples.
Anzaldi, who also runs a cooperative marketing effort for a group of independent restaurants, said the local restaurant business was down, but not significantly.
The reason?
“Canadians,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the economy. That seems to be going well.”
About nine miles away from North Conway, things are a bit quieter in Jackson, home to a famed one-lane covered bridge. With its spas and boutique hotels, Anzaldi said the community is more known as a destination for weddings, romantic stays and outdoor getaways.
While Anzaldi said she hopes Canadian tensions settle soon, she noted that the matter lies in the political domain and there’s little business owners can do but carry on.
“We have to run, right?” she said. “We’re not personally going to go up and advertise.”
States try to ease federal tension
 To maintain tourism and trade, Democratic and Republican politicians in the Northeast have made overtures to their counterparts in Canada.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has met with Maine businesses near the border, embarked on a diplomatic Canadian tour and even installed “Bienvenue Canadiens” welcome signs near border crossings. But on her trip this summer, she was reminded that it’s not just tariffs that have irked Canadians — many are also worried about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
Ambassador Hoekstra says U.S. and Canadian leaders aiming to mend fences

“Lots of people don’t feel safe in the U.S. right now and for good reason,” Susan Holt, the premier of the New Brunswick province, told Mills, according to local news accounts. Holt has encouraged her constituents to avoid traveling to the United States.
Last year, the state said some 800,000 Canadians visited Maine. On her June trip, Mills asked Canadians to remember those who rely on the tourism industry.
“To the extent people feel angst about coming to Maine, just remember that if they aren’t coming to Maine, the ones that they’re hurting are the small mom and pop businesses,” the governor told News Center Maine while in Halifax.
Mills’ office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Similarly, New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte said ahead of a trade mission that she aimed to welcome Canadians to the Granite State, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported.
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said last month. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
Ayotte’s office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment about her trip.
René Sylvestre, the Quebec province’s delegate to New England, said those gestures are appreciated. He spends much of his time meeting with state and business leaders. Last month, he met numerous state lawmakers at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, where he is posted.
But he said calming federal tensions will be key to seeing a rebound in tourism.
“What we can see right now is people in Quebec are really sad with the whole situation,” he told Stateline. “But they’re saying, ‘Maybe we should stay and spend more time in Canada these days.’ So this is really the impact that we’ve seen, and we think that it’s going to take a while before it’s back to normal.”
A decline in international travel has hit border communities across the country — from New York state to Washington state. North Dakota   estimated that Canadian visitors spent about $14.4 million less in the first half of the year compared with last year, as the number of personal vehicles crossing the border from Canada declined by 30%. Other hubs for international visitors, including Las Vegas and Hawaii, are also seeing significant declines.
“Right now, it’s hard to turn back federal policy,” Hawaii state Sen. Ron Kouchi told Stateline in August.
Kouchi, a Democrat and president of the state Senate, said Canada has traditionally been among Hawaii’s top five travel markets. The state has sent tourism officials to trade shows and is trying to show Canadians, like all visitors, the Aloha State’s iconic hospitality. But he said that message hasn’t been persuasive, even coming from leaders of the solidly liberal state.
“While we argue about Republicans or Democrats, in other nations they simply look at Americans and they don’t see it as an R or a D thing,” he said. “It’s an American thing.”
A stormy beach season
Old Orchard Beach in Maine is a favorite of New Englanders and Canadians alike.
Part of the Portland metropolitan area, the vacation town sports a seaside amusement park and seven miles of sandy beaches. But some Canadians started to cancel their summer reservations to the area early on in Trump’s term.
Sean Nickless, who co-owns the 30-room Crest Motel with his family, said Canadians began calling off trips in January and February,
Those cancellations and poor weather foretold a slower summer. “It’s not as steady,” Nickless said, noting business had been inconsistent with shorter stays.
Rainy skies left few people at the bars and attractions lining the pier at Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 31. Hospitality businesses in this beach vacation town reported thinner crowds this summer as they faced poor weather and a drop in Canadian visitors. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)
Like many of the other beachfront properties here, the retro Crest Motel relies heavily on repeat customers, filled out by the occasional road tripper who ducks in from the angled carport to ask about an available room.
“The best you can do is let Canadians know they’re still welcome here,” he said from the motel’s small lobby scented with the aroma of a drip coffeemaker and a bright popcorn machine.
At the height of summer, rain ushered in what should have been a booming weekend along the Atlantic’s Saco Bay. Crest Motel guests swam, but only under the cover of the pool’s rolling roof.
Down the way, five teenagers stood listlessly inside a walkup Dairy Queen with no customers to serve. On the pier, arcade games, $1-per-visit restrooms and barstools sat idle. Few took up heavily advertised offers for pizza by the slice, $15 lobster rolls or fried clam cakes.
“I’ve never driven around Old Orchard Beach in the summer and seen ‘vacancy signs.’ I  have this year,” said state Sen. Donna Bailey, who represents the community. “I mean, you just never see that in the middle of July — all you see is ‘no vacancy’ signs.” A Democrat, Bailey emphasized that Canada isn’t some far-off destination for Mainers. People routinely cross the border for health care and work. They have friends and family on both sides.
“I mean, there’s some places up in northern Maine that the nearest hospital is in Canada, as opposed to in the United States. You know, some people have their babies over in Canada.”
But aside from emphasizing existing bonds, Bailey said Maine residents and officials were largely at the mercy of the federal government’s actions.
“I think it’s helpful to remind the Canadians of our personal relationship and that we are Maine and we’re Mainers, and so we’re not necessarily the same as the federal government,” she said. “But, yeah, it does only go so far.”

(Photo courtesy of Erol Reyal)President Donald Trump confirmed Thursday that Wisconsin will get $29.8 million in federal relief funding to support flood damage victims. 
Massive storms brought record-breaking flooding in southeast Wisconsin about a month ago. Preliminary damage assessments conducted by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Wisconsin Emergency Management had suggested that over 1,500 residential structures were destroyed or sustained major damage and total damage costs estimated at over $33 million across three counties. Damage reports had also indicated over $43 million in public sector damage throughout six counties.
Gov. Tony Evers had officially requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration and FEMA funding during the last week of August. His request included access to FEMA’s Individual Assistance and Public Assistance for Milwaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties, which could help residents get reimbursements for costs from flood damage. 
“We had Huge Victories in Wisconsin in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and it is my Honor to deliver BIG for Wisconsinites!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post about approving the FEMA funding. 
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wrote in a post on X that Trump called him to deliver the news of the approval. 
“Thank you to President Trump for continuing to deliver BIG TIME for Wisconsinites,” Johnson said. He also thanked U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil and Scott Fitzgerald for helping to lead the push for the assistance.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore had also called for the funding. 
“It’s been more than a month since disaster hit Wisconsin, and families are hurting. I have been fighting for these funds because Wisconsinites need help and they need it now,” Baldwin said in a statement. “I’ll continue to closely monitor to make sure Wisconsin gets everything we need to be on the road to recovery and the whole-of-government recovery effort does right by all Wisconsinites.”

But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”










America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.


Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

Javier Zayas Photography/Getty ImagesGeorgia residents may face an uphill battle accessing COVID-19 vaccines this fall, as federal agencies consider sweeping changes to eligibility requirements for immunizations.
The process of updating vaccine guidelines — which for many years has been a matter of routine — is now increasingly uncertain amid shifting federal guidance on public health policies. And in the absence of a federal consensus, states are beginning to develop their own vaccine policies. Northeast and western states are forming new vaccine coalitions to provide access to residents who might not qualify under potential future Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, while Florida has announced plans to eliminate vaccine mandates altogether.
But Georgia, which is home to the Atlanta-based CDC, has held off on administering updated state guidelines — at least for now. Last week, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it will be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine until after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issues its annual recommendations. The panel is scheduled to meet in Atlanta from Sept. 18-19.
CDC vaccine panel abruptly overhauled by RFK Jr. says it will review childhood vaccination schedules

Established in 1964, ACIP is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible immunizations are for the public to access. Georgia is also one of a handful of states that have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, giving the panel’s decisions more weight than it has in some neighboring states.
In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked with overseeing vaccine development, approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines aimed at providing immunity against the JN.1 variant. However, the new recommendations limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.
Part of the reason patients may have trouble accessing vaccines, advocates say, is because health care providers are uncertain about how to interpret new state and federal guidelines, and don’t want to risk violating the law.
“Usually, all of these groups and all of these people are in lockstep,” said Scott Thorpe, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Public Health Leadership. “They’re obviously not in lockstep right now, and so that’s part of why this process is breaking down, and it creates a lot of uncertainty for everybody.”
New Covid shots arriving in pharmacies. Why you may need a prescription – for now

If the CDC’s panel votes in favor of similar restrictions, Georgia residents who do not fit the eligibility criteria may be required to get a prescription before they can be given a COVID-19 booster shot, and pay for the full cost out of pocket. Georgia’s public health department said the out-of-pocket cost for last year’s vaccine was around $180.
Members of Georgia’s Board of Public Health, some of whom are former CDC employees, expressed skepticism about the upcoming ACIP recommendations at Tuesday’s board meeting. Board Chair Dr. James Curran, who previously spent more than two decades working at the CDC, criticized the “turmoil and huge morale problems” the agency has been facing in the wake of a deadly shooting and recent turnover of top officials.
“As far as I can tell, a major goal is to diminish the CDC role in vaccines in a lot of ways,” Curran told the board.
“What we can expect is very controversial guidance which will focus on vaccine injuries more than on vaccine expansion,” he added.
Georgia Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey stressed that the department is still “very committed to immunizations,” and said she has been in contact with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp as the department considers next steps. A Kemp spokesperson did not respond to questions about the governor’s stance on COVID-19 vaccine access.
“We are waiting to see the CDC/ACIP guidelines,” Toomey said, adding that the federal guidelines will also impact insurance and liability coverage for vaccines. “If it is really out of line with what we feel is appropriate, given the science and epidemiologic trends as we know it, we can make decisions then.”

New polling for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group paints a picture of Massachusetts residents mostly happy with their health care coverage, especially when compared with other states, even while large slices of the population report struggling with cost and access.
The post New poll shows high satisfaction with health insurance in M[...]","MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS ARE largely content with their health care quality and coverage, according to a new CommonWealth Beacon poll. But digging beneath the high level of satisfaction reveals access and cost issues leading to delayed care for residents across the Commonwealth. 
One third of residents say they have skipped or delayed seeking care due to cost in the last year, and 25 percent say cost led them to skip or delay seeking care for a dependent. Even getting that care can be a time gamble. A fifth of the state’s residents say they’ve had to wait more than two months for a primary care appointment, and 16 percent have had to wait that long for a specialist. 
The sweeping poll on heath care access for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – ran from August 11 to 18 and surveyed 1,000 Massachusetts residents with a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (Topline | Crosstabs)  

It paints a picture of Massachusetts residents mostly happy with their health care coverage, especially when compared with other states, even while large slices of the population report struggling with cost and access.  
“There can be two truths,” said Steve Walsh, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association. “It can be true that we’re doing well, and it can also be true that we need to do better. And there is no doubt that health care costs are rising. It’s making it harder on employers, including our health care institutions – which are our largest employer in the Commonwealth – so the cost of care impacts their ability to invest in workforce and cutting-edge technologies as well.”  
“I don’t necessarily see [the poll results] as an outlier,” he added. “I see it as that we’re getting incredibly good care here, but we need to be more focused on making sure it’s affordable.” 
Massachusetts is highly insured – around 2 percent of the state is without some type of insurance coverage – and generally able to access care. A plurality (41 percent) of residents reported an employer plan as their primary source of health insurance, with 23 percent each saying MassHealth/Medicaid or Medicare.  
The vast majority of residents say they are either very satisfied (40 percent) or somewhat satisfied (36 percent) with their health insurance, with about the same sentiment for people whose care they manage.

When it comes to the selection of primary care physicians nearby covered by their health insurance, residents again largely report being very (42 percent) or somewhat (33 percent) satisfied, and similarly pleased with their selection of specialists. 
Given an open-ended question about how they would describe the health care system in Massachusetts, responses generally reflected three things: it’s excellent, it’s pricey, and it’s slow. 
“We have very good health providers in this area,” said a 54-year-old Chicopee woman. “There are just not enough doctors to provide care.”  
Respondents ranked Massachusetts highly compared to other states. Some 42 percent of residents said Massachusetts is one of the top states in terms of the quality of health care, which is in line with national rankings from groups like The Commonwealth Fund. The Bay State topped the country in overall rankings of health system performance, which aims to capture affordable health coverage, good-quality care, and the opportunity to live a healthy life. Another 27 percent of residents said Massachusetts care quality was above average, and just 2 percent said it was probably one of the worst states. 

These answers grew more positive with income and education level. While just a third of residents making less than $50,000 a year and 27 percent of those with a high school education or less said Massachusetts was one of the top states for health care quality, half of those making over $100,000 annually and 58 percent of those with advanced degrees identified it as a top state. 
One possible explanation for that discrepancy, said Rich Parr, vice president of the MassINC Polling Group, is “that quality is uneven and weighted towards those who can afford it.” 
Massachusetts has the fourth highest per capita health care spending in the country, according to KFF research. The state Health Policy Commission noted in 2024 that Massachusetts is the state with the second highest family health insurance premiums, including out of pocket spending, with the average annual cost of health care for a family exceeding $29,000. 
The Commonwealth Fund, in its national rankings, asks adults if they went without care in the last year due to cost. Its 2025 report using data from 2023 found that 7 percent of adults in Massachusetts went without care in the last year, and only 9 percent of state residents lacked “a usual source of care.” 
The MassINC Polling Group poll, however, included those who have delayed and skipped care in the last year – 33 percent of residents overall and 37 percent of residents making less than $75,000 a year. The Health Policy Commission in 2024 reported 40 percent of their survey respondents (and 48 percent of those with income below $50,000) said they are putting off seeing a doctor or going to a hospital, with cost being the major factor. 
Yet even as poll respondents decried the price of coverage, 30 percent think that Massachusetts health costs are middle of the pack compared to other states, with 10 percent saying it is one of the worst states and 13 percent one of the top states. 

Forty percent hold insurance companies most responsible for the cost of health care, with 16 percent blaming companies that own hospitals and medical practices, and 10 percent saying the costs are due to too many government regulations. 
State insurance regulators this year issued regulatory guidance requiring insurance companies to limit the growth of deductibles and co-pays for patients to the rate of inflation for medical care, Gov. Maura Healey’s office noted. They also negotiated a reduction in proposed insurance rates and approved $75.6 million in rebates to over 350,000 people covered by individual and small employer plans in Massachusetts. 

“The data bear out that we have a real cost challenge and a real system under stress,” said Doug Howgate, president of the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. “It can be helpful to compare ourselves to other states, but we also need to take a look at what these impacts mean for our health care system, our state budget.”  
The state has to begin identifying issues including but not limited to federal Medicaid cuts that could lead to large swaths of people losing their coverage, he said, because “we know there are going to be additional stressors placed on that system over the next few years.” 
On Thursday, Howgate’s organization released an analysis of the looming costs of President Donald Trump’s recent sprawling tax and spend bill. Changes to federal Medicaid policy could reduce MassHealth enrollment by up to 200,000 members and significantly increase burdens on the state’s Health Safety Net. The cost of care for uninsured residents is covered through the safety net, which currently has a funding shortfall of approximately $290 million and reimburses providers at rates far below MassHealth. The changes could increase health safety net demand by up to $510 million, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. 
“Removing thousands of MassHealth members from consistent coverage is likely to worsen long-term health outcomes and reduce the largest and most consistent source of funding for community health centers and safety net hospitals already under significant fiscal strain,” the report’s authors wrote. 
Residents seem to be feeling those strains. While almost 40 percent told pollsters they waited less than two weeks between scheduling and having a primary care appointment, 12 percent said it took three to four weeks, 12 percent said one to two months, and 20 percent said it took more than two months. 
“Healthcare in Massachusetts is difficult to navigate,” said a 40-year-old woman in Freetown. “Not enough PCPs, wait months for the ‘soonest’ appointment, and when you get the appointment it’s a turn and burn visit. Typically, the wait in the lobby is longer than the appointment.” 

Residents in Southeast Massachusetts reported the longest waits – more than a quarter had to wait more than two months for a primary care appointment. Residents in the Greater Boston area, which boasts the highest density of population and health care facilities, were most likely to report three-week to two-month waits. 
“I think the health care system in MA is just ok, not great,” wrote a 42-year-old man from Revere. “In my experience there are always very long waits when scheduling appointments, sometimes many months out. However, these problems probably exist everywhere, and I think MA is likely handling them better than other states.” 
State health officials are trying to address the primary care crisis and related spending in part through a dedicated task force under the Health Policy Commission. Healey’s office also highlighted two bills that she signed, which lower health care costs, cap prescription drug co-pays at $25, improve access to primary care, and increase oversight of the health care industry to protect patients and providers. 
 “Massachusetts has the best health care in the country, and we need to make sure people can afford it,” Healey said in a statement to CommonWealth Beacon. “It’s why we took action to make sure people can continue to get the vaccines they need no matter what happens in Washington, and that insurance will cover it. We also for the first time limited the cost of health care deductibles and co-pays, including capping prescription drug costs at $25.” 
For those who needed specialists, 32 percent of residents were able to get an appointment within two weeks, 18 percent between three and four weeks, 15 percent said one to two months, and 16 percent said they had to wait more than two months to have an appointment with a specialist. 

The contrast between patient experience and overall satisfaction is a bit of a head-scratcher, notes Parr of the polling group. 
“Massachusetts residents seem to have set a pretty low bar when it comes to rating their health insurance and health care experiences,” he said. Majorities are at least somewhat satisfied with their health insurance, despite a third saying they have skipped or delayed care due to cost in the past year, and nearly as many (28 percent) have had a claim denied by their insurance company in the past year, Parr noted.  
Residents who have skipped care or had a claim denied “do have a less rosy view” of their insurance, he said, but still, most of these residents are at least somewhat satisfied. 
“It may be that Massachusetts’s reputation for health care excellence is driving some of this,” he said. “If residents think they are in one of the top health care states – as most do – perhaps they figure that this is the best service they can expect to get.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Following a viral brawl in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio and federal officials are partnering with local law enforcement to fight violent crime.
Federal agencies including the U.S. Marshalls and U.S. Attorney’s office will step up pursuit of parole violations and firearm prosecutions.
Gov. Mike DeWine said this week during a news conference that highway patrol is helping bolster the Cincinnati Police Department.
“We will be providing, and have been providing, to different cities additional manpower and technology in specific circumstances where local authorities, frankly, could use some help,” DeWine said. “Our troopers, since I became governor, have partnered with law enforcement officers in a number of cities — Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Youngstown, Toledo, and now Cincinnati.”
In addition to helping police patrol hotspots, the patrol will be contributing air support to monitor suspects fleeing the scene of a crime.
DeWine emphasized federal law is “extremely, extremely tough” when it comes to defendants found with a gun illegally — an offense known having a weapon under disability.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Dominick Gerace offered assurances that federal officials “care very deeply about local crime.”
“As governor DeWine mentioned, our federal charges carry stiff penalties,” Gerace said. “And we’ll bring those charges from investigations that occur or start at any level — local, state, or federal — and that includes investigations that come off of operations that result from the partnerships that are being announced today.”
The move to prioritize federal prosecution of gun crimes echoes a similar effort from former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers following a spike in homicides in Columbus five years ago.
In an aside, DeWine added, “I wish in the state of Ohio we had a law similar to that. This is not the day to get into that, but I will just say that I would again call upon our state legislature to enact a law similar to what is at the federal level.”
The governor has indeed urged lawmakers to impose new firearm restrictions — particularly after a mass shooting in Dayton’s Oregon district in 2019.
His appeals fell on deaf ears.
Meanwhile, DeWine has signed several measures loosening Ohio’s gun laws including arming teachers, permitless carry, and stand your ground legislation.

Pointing to the to the city’s crime gun intelligence center, Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said her department has long welcomed collaboration with other agencies.
Since the office launched in 2022, they’ve seen “double digit reductions in shooting victims,” she said.
Theetge described the partnership with state and federal officers as “a force multiplier” to build on what the city is already doing.
“We have more eyes, more hands and more hearts committed to the cause of safety,” she said.
Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval said he welcomed the help. He said the city’s recent crime stats offer “a mixed message.”
According to a violent crime survey from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, in the first quarter of this year, Cincinnati’s incidents of homicide, rape, and aggravated assault were down compared to the prior year. Only robberies saw a modest increase.
But in the latest MCCA survey, which covers violent incidents through the end of June, homicides have shot up, now surpassing the amount in the first half of 2024. Robberies have pulled further ahead as well.
Still, Pureval insisted the city is making progress.
“Street level crimes like theft from cars and burglaries have dramatically dropped with property crimes now down year over year, city wide,” he said. “However, violent crime continues to be a challenge.”
The mayor stated violent crime overall is down, but they’re seeing increases specific areas like downtown and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhoods.
Regardless of the data, though, Pureval said he recognizes people don’t feel safe and that it’s incumbent on local leaders to address that.
“We are still working urgently on public safety,” he said. “While it’s important to be aware of the data, what’s also important is to continue to respond from concerns from the community, and that’s exactly what we continue to do.”

Reporting Highlights

Evidence: The government seeks to deport an Ohio chaplain, but its case has come under scrutiny from supporters and legal advocates.
Support: The U.S. paints the chaplain as a link in terrorist organizations, but in Ohio, families laud his work at a children’s hospital and in the community.
Test Case: If the government secures its quest for deportation, experts say the case could empower the Trump administration’s mass deportation blueprint.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 			



In the weeks leading up to July 9, Ayman Soliman told friends he was terrified of losing the sanctuary he’d found after fleeing Egypt in 2014 and building a new life as a Muslim chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.
Soliman, 51, was to show up at 9 a.m. on that date for his first check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement since losing his asylum status. He’d been granted the protections in 2018 under the first Trump administration. Then, in the last month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke them based on sharply disputed claims of fraud and aid to a terrorist group. Once President Donald Trump returned to office weeks later, court records show, immigration officials bumped up the terrorism claims and formalized the asylum termination June 3.
By the time of Soliman’s ICE appointment, friends said, he was distraught over the prospect of being returned to the regime that had jailed him for documenting protests as a journalist. He arrived at the agency’s field office in Blue Ash, Ohio, accompanied by fellow clergy and a couple of Democratic state lawmakers.
“I didn’t come to America seeking a better life. I was escaping death,” he said in a video filmed just before he entered.
Inside, Soliman’s attorneys said, he was shocked to find FBI agents waiting for him. They interrogated him for three hours about his charity work more than a decade ago in Egypt, the basis for the Department of Homeland Security accusations of illegal aid, or “material support,” to Islamist militants.
His lawyer eventually emerged from the ICE office holding a belt and a wallet. Soliman had been swept into custody, joining a record 61,000 people now in ICE detention. As he awaits an immigration court trial Sept. 25, he is being held in a county jail run by a sheriff who posted a sign outside reading, “Illegal Aliens Here.”
Legal observers are watching the chaplain’s case as a bellwether of the Trump administration’s ability to merge the vast federal powers of immigration and counterterrorism. The case is also a reminder, they say, of sweeping post-9/11 statutes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of abusing, especially in cases involving Muslims.
Material support laws ban almost any type of aid to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist groups, extending far beyond the basics of weapons, personnel and money. Prosecutors describe the laws as an invaluable tool against would-be attackers, but civil liberties groups have long complained of overreach.
Over the years, successive administrations have faced legal challenges over how they wield the power; a milestone Supreme Court decision during the Obama administration upheld the laws as constitutional. Now, however, there are particular fears about the material support “sledgehammer,” as one legal scholar put it, in the hands of Trump, who has been openlyhostile toward Muslims and determined to deport a million people who are in the United States without permission.
“These statutes are written extraordinarily broadly with the unstated premise that discretion will be exercised responsibly. And one thing this administration has shown is that it doesn’t understand what it means to exercise discretion responsibly,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who argued high-profile material support cases and served as national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
At issue are DHS allegations that Soliman’s involvement with an Islamic charity provided material support to the Muslim Brotherhood. But neither the charity nor the Brotherhood is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and an Egyptian court found no official ties between the groups.
Faith leaders call on Ohio governor to speak on behalf of jailed cleric

The Biden-era DHS, which first flagged the issue, said it would revoke Soliman’s asylum if “a preponderance of the evidence supports termination” after a hearing, according to the December notice. At the time, court records show, the material support allegation was listed as a secondary concern after more common asylum questions about the veracity of official documents and his claims of persecution in Egypt.
Once Trump came to power weeks later, Soliman’s attorneys said, the material support claims metastasized, with U.S. authorities declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a Tier III, or undesignated, terrorist group and adding new arguments about ties to Hamas. The Brotherhood, a nearly century-old Islamist political movement, renounced violence in the 1970s, though Hamas and other spinoffs are on the U.S. blacklist. In addition to the Egypt-related concerns, DHS filings about Soliman had noted warrants for “murder and terrorism” in Iraq — a country Soliman says he’s never visited.
By elevating the national security argument, Soliman’s lawyers said, DHS was able to bypass an immigration judge and order the chaplain held without bond as “potentially dangerous.” An established terrorism nexus means less transparency for immigrants — and more power for the authorities.
“DHS is judge, jury and executioner,” said Robert Ratliff, one of Soliman’s attorneys.
The idea of Soliman as a secret militant has outraged residents who know him locally as “the interfaith imam” and the first Muslim on the pastoral care team at Cincinnati Children’s, a top-ranked pediatric hospital. Colleagues described a popular chaplain with nicknames for the tiny patients and soothing words for their bleary-eyed parents.
Judy Ragsdale, the former pastoral care director who hired Soliman in 2021 shortly before retiring, said she wrote a letter to hospital leaders imploring them to speak out against the allegations that could return him to certain persecution in Egypt. He lost authorization to work in June, when his asylum was terminated.
“This is a ‘Schindler’s List’ moment,” Ragsdale said she told hospital leaders. “And if you don’t stand up for Ayman, you’re complicit in what’s happening to him.”
Some fear DHS is parlaying the scope and secrecy of counterterrorism laws into a weapon to boost the president’s mass-deportation mission.
Immigrant rights groups say a sped-up campaign with fewer guardrails for due process is already leading to removals based on evidence that hasn’t been fully vetted. If DHS is successful in test cases like Soliman’s, they say, material support claims could be more easily applied to immigration cases with even tenuous links to militant factions, including newly designated cartels.
The White House referred questions to Homeland Security, which routed a request for comment to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; a spokesperson there said in a statement that the agency generally “does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
“An alien — even with a pending application or lawful status — is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” the statement said. The FBI declined to comment.
Jeffrey Breinholt, an architect of the material support statutes who spent three decades as a federal terrorism prosecutor, defends the laws as crucial to closing loopholes that were exploited by foreign militant groups and their domestic sympathizers.
Breinholt, who retired in 2024, said he has no concerns about the widening scope as it converges with Trump’s deportation push. The designation of cartels, he said, “is a natural outgrowth of the success we have had with ‘material support’ crime.”
To Cole and other critics, however, the Soliman case could be “the canary in the coal mine.”
 More Than a Chaplain

Within a few hours of Soliman’s detention, dozens showed up for an impromptu rally and news conference in the ICE center parking lot. That backup has since grown into a hundreds-strong campaign to refute the DHS allegations, which supporters call a resurgence of anti-Muslim fearmongering that has persisted across party lines since the 9/11 attacks 24 years ago this month.
“Any time you have a brown man or a Muslim man and you use the words ‘FBI’ and ‘red flag,’ you don’t have to say any more,” said Tala Ali, a friend of Soliman’s who heads the board of a Cincinnati mosque where he sometimes led prayers.
Voices calling for Soliman’s release include parents who met him in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The families are in disbelief that the chaplain they’d grown close to is now jailed in a high-stakes international case. They knew he’d fled Egypt but said they were learning details of his ordeal through the campaign to free him.
“It would be very easy to be resentful and be angry with the world when you have to live through that kind of trauma, and he’s not like that at all. He’s taking on other peoples’ trauma,” said Heather Barrow, whose infant daughter, Mya, died in the NICU last year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She said Soliman stepped in to spare her grieving family the heartache of making funeral arrangements for a 5-month-old. He attended Mya’s celebration of life and, later, a butterfly release on June 7, which would’ve been her first birthday. A month later, he was in an ICE cell.
“I was like, how is this happening? He was just at our house,” Barrow said.
Another couple, Taylor and Bryan McClain, also came to rely on Soliman when their newborn, Violette, arrived at Cincinnati Children’s last year with life-threatening complications. The chaplain steadied them during their 271 days in the NICU, which Taylor said felt like “a roller coaster in a tornado and it’s on fire.” The McClains call him “family.”
“I say with full confidence: Violette is alive because of the advocacy that Ayman gave us,” Taylor said one recent afternoon as she held her daughter, now just over a year old.
Clergy members make up another bloc of support — so many that they built a spreadsheet to divide visiting hours among imams, rabbis and pastors. Immigration advocates and Ohio civil rights leaders have added their names to petitions. So have University of Cincinnati student groups including the Ornithology Club and the Harry Potter Appreciation Club.
More than a dozen people faced criminal charges stemming from a melee after a rally in Soliman’s support; demonstrators and police blame each other for the violence July 17.
Two of Soliman’s fellow chaplains at Cincinnati Children’s, Adam Allen and Elizabeth Diop, said they lost their jobs for refusing to keep quiet about their jailed colleague. Meanwhile, the hospital, a cherished local institution, is taking heat for its silence. Soliman’s supporters launched a letter-writing campaign demanding a response from the hospital, which has said it does not discuss personnel issues.
Signs appeared outside the hospital. “Missing Chaplain,” they said. “Abducted By ICE.”
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital did not return messages seeking comment. In an internal memo published by The Cincinnati Enquirer, hospital CEO Dr. Steve Davis told employees that the lack of response “should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.” As a nonprofit, Davis stressed, the hospital has strict rules about “activities that could be characterized as political.”
Soliman’s supporters press on. One recent Sunday evening, about 200 filled a Cincinnati church where preachers from several faith backgrounds urged them to demand his freedom.
“The trial that Imam Ayman is going through is our trial,” Abdulhakim Mohamed, head of the North American Imams Fellowship, told the crowd. “His justice is ours to own. The injustice is also ours to bear.”
 Escape From Egypt

Soliman’s entanglement with the Egyptian security apparatus began in 2000 when he joined fellow college students to protest repressive laws, he said in asylum papers.
He was periodically locked up and intimidated after that, he said. The persecution worsened more than a decade ago during uprisings that remade the Middle East by toppling dictators — including Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak — but in some places spiraled into civil war.
Soliman worked as a freelance journalist covering pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and neighboring Libya. Friends say he was also studying to become an imam and served on the board of a local chapter of the Islamic charity Al-Gameya al-Shareya, which is known for its network of hospitals and orphan programs throughout Egypt.
The charity, whose name has multiple English spellings, launched in 1912 and is often described as “one of the most established national Islamic organizations.” Scholars have written that early leaders came from the Muslim Brotherhood, archenemy of Egypt’s current military leadership, but that ties ended around 1990 under government pressure.
In the years since, researchers found, the group maintained smooth relations with the government as its more than 1,000 chapters nationwide encompass Egyptians of all political leanings. That delicate balance faltered briefly in 2013 when a military-led counterrevolution quashed the nascent democratic movement and deposed elected leaders who were part of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Egypt’s military rulers declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and shuttered any organization it suspected of ties. Al-Gameya Al-Shareya was among more than 1,000 civil society groups blacklisted in the crackdown, court filings say, and chapters suspected of helping the Brotherhood during elections were dissolved. The group resumed operations the next year, when an Egyptian court lifted the ban, ruling that the charity “has no ties to the Muslim Brotherhood,” according to news reports.

Egypt’s return to zero tolerance for dissidents made Soliman’s activism dangerous, he said in court papers. As a journalist and Islamic scholar, he represented two fields the Egyptian government views as existential threats: a free press and religious organizing.
Soliman fled to the United States in 2014 on a visitor visa and later filed a petition for asylum, describing how security forces over the years had locked him up on false charges and tortured him with electrical shocks. In one incident, his attorney said, Egyptian forces with machine guns stormed into an apartment where Soliman was asleep with his wife and young child. (Through attorneys, Soliman asked to withhold details about his family because they remain in Egypt.)
“For me, it’s life or death,” Soliman later told a U.S. immigration officer of his need to escape.
Officials in Cairo referred questions to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, which did not respond to requests for comment.
The asylum application asked whether Soliman had belonged to political parties or other associations in his home country. Ratliff, the attorney, said Soliman marked “yes” and attached a statement that mentioned Al-Gameya Al-Shareya and his role in fundraising for the local chapter.
Friends said Soliman rejoiced when he was granted asylum in 2018, under the first Trump administration, and sought permanent residency as the next step toward reuniting with his family. But the process stalled. “Bureaucratic hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle,” Ratliff said.
Then came a more serious snag. In 2021, Soliman learned he was on a federal watchlist when a background check for a chaplain job at an Oregon prison showed that the FBI had flagged him, court papers show.
His attorneys said they have no idea why. It could’ve been about a specific piece of intelligence. It could’ve been a misspelling or mistaken identity, simple errors that have landed ordinary Muslims on opaque “war on terror” watchlists that are nearly impossible to get off.
Soliman, friends say, insisted on trying to clear his name. With the help of the Muslim Legal Fund of America, he sued government agencies including the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. That route led to open-ended legal battles that yielded no clear answers and no green card.
Instead, his place in the country became more vulnerable. In December, the final stretch of the Biden administration, Soliman received notice that the government intended to terminate his asylum based on “inconsistencies” in his claims of persecution and concern that his charity work made him inadmissible based on “possible membership in a terrorist organization.”
Some of his friends are convinced it was payback for the lawsuits, but attorneys say there’s no telling what triggered a review.
“What Ayman has experienced is something that, post-9/11, has been the reality of Muslims in this country,” said Ali, his friend and advocate. “All he did was try to get answers and accountability for what he’d been put through.”
 Big Claims, Little Transparency

Contested asylum cases like Soliman’s were prime targets when Trump took office the next month and supercharged deportations, a top campaign pledge. Since his return to office, ICE arrests have doubled.

Soliman was called to an asylum hearing in February, a month into the new administration, for a last shot at defending his eligibility. A DHS officer asked about claims in the Biden-era notice alleging “discrepancies in date and number of times he suffered harm” and raising doubts about a handwritten Egyptian police report and letters authenticating his journalistic work.
A transcript shows Soliman explaining that he sometimes got confused when describing traumatic incidents from years ago in English, his second language. He said the police report was a rough translation included by mistake and submitted statements verifying his journalism.
Then the DHS officer’s questioning took a turn: “When did you start supporting Al-Jameya Al-Shareya?”
For the rest of the meeting, the transcript shows, the officer drilled down on Soliman’s knowledge of the charity: fundraising, chapter size, support for violence and whether he had been aware of a Brotherhood link.
Another of Soliman’s attorneys interrupted when the immigration officer said the Brotherhood had been a Tier III group since 2012. That’s not how it works, the attorney countered — only top-tier terrorist organizations like al-Qaida or the Islamic State are given dates of designation. Tier III, she said, is for undesignated groups and is determined on a case-by-case basis, with the burden of proof on the government.
“Counsel, I’ll give you an opportunity at the end to make a closing,” the DHS officer said.
“I understand,” the attorney replied, “but we’re talking about something factual.”
The next time Soliman heard from DHS was the official termination of his asylum, effective June 3. This time, there was no hedging in language that declared he was ineligible based on “evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier III terrorist organization.” A few weeks later, he was taken into custody and notified of his pending removal.
Soliman’s legal team sued, arguing that he was stripped of asylum on illegal grounds because the designations had been made “without proper findings” and based on no new evidence.
Court filings show DHS attorneys introducing, then withdrawing or amending, materials to build a case linking Soliman to the Brotherhood through the charity.
“It looked like, ‘What can we put here to get to there?’” said Ratliff, a former immigration judge.
Among the supporting evidence filed by the government are three academic reports by scholars with deep knowledge of Islamic charities in Egypt. Soliman’s legal team filed statements from all three balking at how DHS had cherry-picked their research.
Steven Brooke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison detailed “important mistakes of fact and interpretation.” Neil Russell, an academic in Scotland, called the U.S. conclusions “a mischaracterization of my findings.” Marie Vannetzel, a French scholar who has conducted field research with Al-Gameya Al-Shareya, rebutted what she called “a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”
Vannetzel wrote that she rejects the idea that Soliman, “simply by virtue of his activity in the association, could be accused of providing material support to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
Observers of Cairo’s unsparing campaign to uproot Islamist opposition say the matter is clear-cut: If the charity survived the scrutiny of Egyptian intelligence, then it’s not Muslim Brotherhood. “It’s really striking that this group is not proscribed,” said Michael Hanna, an Egypt specialist and U.S. program director of the nonprofit International Crisis Group.
Soliman’s attorneys also criticized the government’s assertion in court filings that he, as a board member of one local branch, would’ve been aware of any Brotherhood affiliation of chapters nationwide. “If a Rotarian in Seattle commits murder, we don’t go charging Rotarians in Des Moines with conspiracy,” Ratliff said.
Separate from U.S. attempts to tie Soliman to the Brotherhood was a puzzling footnote about Iraq that appeared in a later filing. Without detail, DHS attorneys alluded to warrants for “murder and terrorism activities.” Ratliff said a DHS attorney later confirmed to him in a phone call that it wasn’t about Soliman, but didn’t explain why it was there.
The error remained uncorrected in filings until Sept. 3, when DHS attorney Cheryl Gutridge acknowledged in court that it was an “inadvertent” reference to another case, Ohio news outlets reported. The original wording suggesting that Soliman faced murder charges in Iraq had been included in the government’s successful argument for keeping him in custody.
DHS did not address questions about the Iraq reference.
A close friend, Ahmed Elkady, said Soliman told him on a jail visit he was stunned to be linked to Iraq, a place he’s never been: “He said, ‘How can I become a virtual terrorist?”
 A Sheriff’s ICE Fiefdom

As he awaits trial in immigration court, Soliman is in custody at the Butler County Jail, about 30 miles outside of Cincinnati, past cornfields and a German social club and the Town and Country Mobile Home Park.
For more than 20 years, this outpost has been the domain of Sheriff Richard Jones, a cowboy hat-wearing firebrand who keeps a framed photo of Trump in his office. In the run-up to the 2024 election, Jones mused that a Trump victory might put him “back in the deportation business.”
From 2003 to 2021, the jail had been contracted to house immigration detainees until the arrangement dissolved in the Biden era. As predicted, the county entered into a new agreement with ICE in February, after Trump returned to power, to hold around 400 detainees: $68 a day per person, plus $36 an hour for the sheriff’s office toward transportation.
Jones celebrated the restored partnership by posting a fake image showing inflatable gators outside the jail, a nod to ICE’s “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida. A Black Lives Matter group in Dayton issued a statement calling the sheriff’s post an “egregious act of cruelty and historical mockery.”
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

As it returns to deportation work, the jail still faces a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in 2020 by two ICE prisoners who said they endured beatings and discrimination. One plaintiff, a Muslim, said a jailer called him a “fucking terrorist” and threatened to throw his prayer rug in the toilet. Jones has disputed the claims.
The sheriff is in the news again because of Soliman. In court filings, the Muslim chaplain says he was denied access to a space where he could lead communal prayers and then placed in “isolation” for nearly a week with only an hour of phone access between midnight and 1 a.m.
Soliman’s attorneys say in court papers that the episode was related to “targeted harassment” over his religion. The sheriff’s office told local outlets that it respects religious freedom and said Soliman was placed in isolation because he was “argumentative” and “threatening.”
After agreeing to an interview with ProPublica, Jones later decided he was “no longer interested,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Deputy Kim Peters, wrote in a text message.
As he languishes in jail, Soliman’s empty apartment in Cincinnati has become a way station for an inner circle of supporters, who said they felt like “intruders” when they first gathered there. Soliman is known as an elegant dresser, but his apartment was in bachelor-pad disarray, a reflection of his long hours at the hospital and the abruptness of his detention, said his friends, also clerics. The imams laughed when one confessed that he first thought the FBI had ransacked the place.
Over water bottles and energy drinks scavenged from Soliman’s fridge, they talked about the deportation threat. In Egypt, pro-government news outlets already have trumpeted the case as proof that Soliman was leading a secret Brotherhood cell in America.
Despite Soliman’s predicament, they said, being in limbo here is preferable to the alternative.
“You think I’m afraid of being here in jail?” Soliman told fellow imam Ihab Alsaghier during a recent visit. “Every moment I’m alone, I imagine I’m on a flight back to Egypt.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ayman-Clapping-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 04:56:45.436875

(Eric Thomas illustration)Dear Cracker Barrel, 
We need to talk about your redesigned logo. The one you released last month to nationwide groans. The one paired with new interior designs for your restaurants. The one that shoved your stock price into a tumble. The one that sent you scrambling back to your traditional logo less than two weeks later. 
First, let me say this: The only times I’ve eaten at Cracker Barrel was when I lived in a small town.
Twenty-four years ago, our country home, a two-story farmhouse with a tin roof, squatted in the Indiana fields. My wife and I had a firepit where we shared evening beers while birds and bats swooped above our heads, divebombing bugs under a summer sunset. Behind the home was a red barn, and on its side a previous owner wrote “NO PRISON” as a protest against plans for a jail.
We had a new dog and a few acres. And we ate biscuits and gravy at Cracker Barrel. 
If that sounds like the start of a country song, that’s my point.
Your now infamous redesign went wrong by ignoring a quality — let’s call it “country” — that made Cracker Barrel unique.
Because the restaurant is so connected to its country identity, I bet that people would have shrugged if you had renamed the restaurant “Country Barrel.” Instead, the changes to the logo made conservative America gasp and boycott.
Let’s break down your changes to the logo.
Your company, which has five restaurants in Kansas, announced last month that the logo and interior design of its 660 nationwide restaurants would be updated. Because I teach visual design and not interior design, I will stick to your (attempted) logo switch.
For years, your logo featured three main elements. Let’s inspect each one to understand the outrage you absorbed.
On the left side of the logo is a duotone image of a man leaning against a barrel, sitting in a wooden kitchen chair with a woven seat. Clad in overalls, his legs cross as he smiles directly at us. The image mimics prints made from woodcuts, the kind of illustrations printed before mass production of photographs was possible. He is an old-timer shown in an old timey way.
Let’s also note how clumsy that duotone image was. The barrel was illustrated in one style: crisp, linear and simple. The man and the chair? They are illustrated with more nuance and shadowing, reflecting the true textures of real life.
Why am I pointing out this contrast? This is the kind of stuff that drives graphic designers bonkers. I can imagine the in-house graphic design team at corporate headquarters itching to discard this awkward asymmetry: “Let’s ditch grandpa. His illustrated style is so incongruous! So cacophonous!”
On the right side of the logo are the words “Cracker Barrel” held inside a pumpkin-ish shape. So, the logo had a bumpkin and a pumpkin.
The contours of the shape provide room for the upper-case “C” but amputate the letter “B.” (Again, urbane graphic designers wince.) Elsewhere, the stroke of the “k” veers wildly up and to the right. It’s a flourish that mimics handmade country signs before the standardization of typefaces and desktop publishing.
The pumpkin shape that holds the brand name? We can imagine it dangling from two chains on Main Street in a small, southern town. Just like grandpa to the left, the right side of the logo is drenched in country schmaltz.
The final element of the logo was the bottom: the words “OLD COUNTRY STORE.” The typography here is more contemporary through its use of a condensed, all-caps sans serif font. But this is not trendy typography. The logo’s mood remains as safe in its country aesthetic as the center line on a deserted gravel road. 
How did the logo redesign go, Cracker Barrel?
You axed two of the three elements, and the final element was drastically changed. Goodbye to the old-timer and his clip-art barrel, side-lit in the country sunset.
And good bye to “OLD COUNTRY STORE.”
If those changes slapped traditionalists in the face, the changes to the design of the brand name were a gut punch.
In the new brand logo, the color changes migrate from the country and right into the suburbs. The former color of the typography was warm brown, a color connected with rural life. Think agriculture (dirt), manual labor (mahogany stain) and barbecue sauce.
The new typography color is nearly black — if not pure black: sleek, balletic and urban. The color choices drive us a few more miles away from the county fair.
You changed the pumpkin shape to a hexagon with rounded corners. The logo’s typography centers itself inside, with plenty of room to spare. If the shape calls back to anything, perhaps it’s vintage Texaco signs. But what’s the use in that?
The redesign abandoned a central value that customers saw in your restaurants: the country charm of reclaimed wood, down-home cooking and an old timer in overalls. No wonder our country’s polarized, high-octane outrage machine shipped a fresh installment of umbrage to the front door of your corporate headquarters.
In the end, Cracker Barrel, you know the irony of this as well as I do.
There are five restaurant locations in Kansas — none of them in the country. All of them are in the exurbs, squatting at the exits from major highways: Junction City, Olathe, Topeka and two in Wichita. The big wide country of western Kansas has zero Cracker Barrels.
But Denver has one.
Your restaurants are surrounded by convenience stores, big-box retailers and interstate motels. You’re as country as Great Clips, Kohl’s and Mizu Sushi.
So maybe your attempted corporate redesign — a purge of the logo’s rural symbolism — is perfect after all. Maybe you were never as quite as country as any of us imagined.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.)At a recent rally in Hilliard sponsored by the Americans for Prosperity PAC, Ohio Republican governor candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched into a predictable GOP attack on public education. 
“We are going to bring a radical revolution of standards to our public schools,” he told the gathering.
If you want to go beyond Ramaswamy’s rhetoric, look at a few key words he used, including radical and standards, in his remarks about student outcomes in reading and math. 
Let’s also consider what he didn’t say in the predictable Republican exercise of bashing “failing public schools.”
Contrary to Ramaswamy’s assertion of bringing a radical revolution of standards, in fact it’s the private and religious schools that Ramaswamy and his fellow Republicans favor that mostly lack the kind of common standards that public schools must meet. 
In Ohio, for example, there is no requirement for private and religious schools to take state assessments, the very instruments that provide the reading and math data as well as state report cards that provide ammunition for public education critics. 
Never mind that all Ohio public school students, unlike students enrolled in the 1,300 non-public schools, are required to participate in state testing.
Back to that word radical for a moment. 
Isn’t it extreme to provide $6,166 per pupil for K-8 students and $8,408 for high school students with no required measures in place to assess the performance of the schools receiving taxpayer dollars?  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ramaswamy, a proud entrepreneur, knows quite well that it’s a radical step for any entity, particularly the State of Ohio, to invest $1 billion on a universal voucher initiative and receive no data about the level of performance or impact such spending might have generated.
Now that’s radical, don’t you think?
So think report cards. 
Think reading and math scores for those private and religious schools that accept public money. 
But expect them to also say that it’s socialism to have strings attached as part of having access to the public treasury in the form of education vouchers.
Whether it’s private and religious schools, their proponents have mastered the art of having it both ways: ‘Yes, we believe in and promote school choice. But don’t ever ask us to comply with state assessment standards that can assist the public in having a more comprehensive school report card system. Just send the money.’
And don’t talk about “School Choice” when it’s really about the “School’s Choice” as demonstrated by who is and isn’t admitted and by the “counsel out” process for those students who require more services and instructional support.
But wait, there’s more to consider about Ramaswamy’s remarks that focused on reading and math achievement. 
In these days of rapidly advancing technology and artificial intelligence, what about instruction in science in private and religious schools?
If non-public schools are exempt from so many of the requirements that are mandatory for public schools, do we have assurances that science is even taught in them, particularly those that are affiliated with conservative Christian and other sects?
This statement published several years ago from Americans United for Separation of Church and State gets to the heart of the issue of bad science or no science in some religious schools that are partially supported by the public treasury:

        “There are young people all over America right now learning not just that evolution is weak, but that it’s false. These children are being taught that the Earth, which we know to be five billion years old, is only 6,000 years old. They are being taught that dinosaurs and humans existed at the same time.”

Residents of New York State saw a similar situation a few years back when a group of ultra-religious schools were quick to apply for state funds while ignoring the delivery of a curriculum that would prepare a young person with the necessary tools to be successful – and literate. 
One education expert had this observation:

        “When the state or city says that the yeshivas should provide an education for their students that is ‘substantially equivalent’ to secular education, their leaders cry ‘separation of church and state!’ But, inconsistently, their representatives in the legislature actively lobby for tuition tax credits and vouchers. They want the state’s money but not its oversight of the education they provide.”

Sounds like Ohio, doesn’t it?  
As the debate on no-strings educational vouchers continues, Ohio citizens must be strong in demanding oversight for the expenditure of scarce public dollars that may be going to public and religious schools that lack the transparency needed to ensure that students are prepared for an increasingly complex world.
So, it’s time for the “Science of Reading” to be joined by a new initiative that will ensure that students who receive taxpayer-supported educational vouchers are taught …. science.
Let’s call this new initiative Science in Science, where all citizens are assured that the expenditure of public tax dollars in any school in the state support a proper public purpose and produce an informed citizenry that is literate in science as well as reading and math.
Would that be radical? I think not.

Hoover, chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission, which said Thursday that it will take until at least February 2027 to complete its review of the controversial Piedmont power line. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland regulators will take until at least February 2027 before they can issue a final ruling on the proposed Piedmont power line, according to a schedule set Thursday by the Maryland Public Service Commission.
That schedule is almost a year longer than PSEG Renewable Transmission, the New Jersey-based company planning the line, had hoped for. The company had said that the PSC  would need to issue its decision by the end of March 2026 in order for it to meet a deadline from the region’s electric grid operator to bring the controversial line in-service by June 2027.
The grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has warned that the 67-mile transmission line is among the projects that are necessary in order for it to avoid power failures such as blackouts amid surging demand, thanks in part to the rise of data centers, particularly in Virginia.
But the PSC said in a news release Thursday, in essence, that the grid can wait while it takes the time needed for it to fully evaluate the project.
“In adopting this schedule that includes a longer timeline than PSEG had requested, the Commission has confidence that PJM, the region’s grid operator, will efficiently maintain the grid during the duration of the Commission’s review of PSEG’s application,” read the statement from the five-member Commission, a five-member commission.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

The commissioners also argued that PSEG submitted its application later than expected — on Dec. 31, 2024, rather than in the third quarter of 2024 as originally planned — “leaving less time for the Commission to carry out its review,” the news release said.
At issue is whether or not the commission grants PSEG a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, which would allow them to construct the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project across northern Maryland. In a statement Thursday, the transmission company said that the power line “is a necessary infrastructure project to ensure grid reliability and affordability for Maryland ratepayers.”
“We have received the Public Service Commission’s procedural schedule, and our team is presently conducting a review to determine the appropriate next steps,” wrote William J. Smith, a PSEG spokesperson.
The project, a large transmission line planned to stretch 67 miles through rural parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, has attracted considerable opposition from residents, who argue that it will tear through natural lands — all in the name of shipping power through the heart of Maryland to a power station near the Virginia border.
In a statement Thursday, Stop MPRP,  a coalition formed to protest the project, applauded the schedule proposed by the PSC.
“PSEG asked for a rushed timeline that would have forced a decision by early 2026 — before complete studies of farmland, forests, wetlands, and community impacts could even be done,” the statement read. “The PSC rejected that approach.”
The coalition of property owners and other project opponents have also balked at PSEG’s attempts to conduct land surveys for the project, arguing that the surveys represent the company prematurely invoking eminent domain before it has the approval of Maryland regulators.
Federal courts have so far disagreed. A U.S. District Court judge in Baltimore has issued orders allowing PSEG to go onto the property of uncooperative landowoners to complete its surveys on hundreds of properties. Many landowners have appealed the decision in the ongoing case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the judge’s order, PSEG argued that a handful of landowners were continuing to resist the surveys, and requested back-up from U.S. marshals. But after most of those landowners pledged to allow surveyors onto their property, a judge ruled that the marshals would not be necessary.
The schedule released Thursday calls on PSEG to complete the surveys and submit an updated environmental review for the project by March. Involved parties, including landowners, Maryland’s ratepayer advocate and experts from the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, would file briefs with the PSC by September 2026, followed by two weeks of public hearings in the affected coiunties.
Evidentiary hearings would come in December 2026, and the parties would then submit post-hearing briefs by February 2027. The PSC would make its decision some time after reviewing those briefs, although it isn’t clear how long that could take. The schedule could be amended later for “good cause,” said Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the PSC.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0305-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 02:56:19.887459

Both House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) reported receiving bomb threats that were directed at their homes, not their state offices. The threats were deemed credible, officials said, but police ultimately did not find an actual threat.
The only injury reported was at the Naval Academy, where officials said a lockdown was imposed “out of an abundance of caution” after a nonfatal, accidental shooting of a midshipman on campus, which followed threats that had been received at the academy earlier in the day. The campus was put on lockdown shortly before 6 p.m. and remained so into the evening, No other injuries were reported.
Maryland was not alone. Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia were on lockdown Thursday after officials at those campuses received what one called “terroristic threats.”
Democratic legislative leaders in Rhode Island and New Mexico were also the targets of bomb threats, as was the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, which was closed by a bomb threat Thursday, according to news reports.
State lawmakers reconsider cost, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

None of the threats were linked directly to the killing of Kirk, who was gunned down during a public appearance before several thousand people Wednesday at Utah Valley University. But in most cases, authorities said the decided to be on the safe side, given the mood of the nation.
Ferguson said that after the killing of Kirk, and the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker in June and attempted killing of another, “it is clear that tragic political violence is on the rise.”
“Earlier today, the Baltimore Police Department received a bomb threat involving our family home. Thankfully, everyone is safe and secure,” said Ferguson, who went on to praise Baltimore City and Maryland State Police in a social media post.
That was echoed by Jones, who said authorities responded quickly to “a bomb threat at my home in Baltimore County … and determined that it was a non-credible bomb threat.”
“While such threats are violating, we can’t let them distract from the important work we do,” she said on social media. “Tonight, I will take time to care for my family and team and look forward to getting back to work tomorrow.”
As they did after the killing of Kirk, state leaders from both sides of the aisle reacted to the threats against Jones and Ferguson with denunciations of political violence and calls for civility in public life.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said on a Facebook post that Jones and Ferguson are “decent, respectful and when they can, consistent with their political beliefs, helpful and accommodating to me and my constituents.” He noted that Jones’ son died unexpectedly earlier this year and that Ferguson has a family with young children
“Calling in bomb threats to their residences or threatening them with violence of any form is despicable and does nothing to advance the conservative cause or better our nation’s future,” he wrote, adding that whoever made the threats should be “investigated, charged and punished significantly.”
Although he disagrees “strenuously” with much of what Democrats advance in Annapolis, Buckel said he would defend them “from violent and unhinged people on either side of the political divide who think that threats and violence are acceptable. Enough.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said on social media that his administration “takes threats like these seriously. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Violence of any type — including rhetoric and threats — will not be tolerated.”
Ferguson said the current violent political climate is “a poison whose inevitable outcome is the destruction of us all.”
“Somehow and someway, the current momentum of our political culture must move away from dehumanizing our ideological opponents and towards a recognition of our shared experiences in this world together,” he wrote. “We can and must be better than this.”

In a moment I would replay in my mind hundreds of times, I watched the side of my obstetrician’s face, illuminated by the glow of the ultrasound screen. The nurse had called her in after she couldn’t find my baby’s heartbeat with the Doppler wand.
I had gone into the office first thing that morning because I hadn’t been feeling my baby move. He was due in just over three weeks. Truth be told, I wasn’t overly concerned. The iconic pregnancy book “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” didn’t have much to say about fetal movements. Everything I’d researched said that babies slow down at the end of pregnancy. The night before, my husband asked if he should come. I told him to go to work.
My doctor was upbeat at first, but her face changed. After several minutes of searching the ultrasound screen, she said, “There is no heartbeat.”
In that moment, I couldn’t comprehend what she said. This was my second child — no complications, the nursery was ready at home. Dumbfounded, I asked, “What does that mean?” Still staring at the screen, she softly replied, “I’m afraid it means the baby has died.” Reality shattered. I don’t remember much after, only sitting in the dark waiting for my husband, numb with disbelief, thinking, “I guess this was a stillbirth.”
Before it happened to me, I thought stillbirth was something that had ended back in the 1800s. No one had informed me how common it still is today, with 20,000 babies stillborn each year in the U.S. That’s one out of every 170 pregnancies — 65 stillbirths every single day. And now, my son, Luke, was one of them.

These basic facts about stillbirth opened the door to a hidden world of pregnancy loss, just beneath the myth that everything is safe after 12 weeks. Thrust into a quiet, nationwide community of grieving parents, I began to realize how everything I didn’t know about pregnancy had, in fact, hurt me and my child.
The next morning, I delivered Luke. The obstetrician — not my regular doctor — advised against an autopsy, saying, “Sometimes these things just happen.” But that wasn’t good enough. Luke’s death didn’t make sense, and we needed answers. The autopsy showed Luke was perfect — but his placenta was tiny, shriveled, and filled with blood clots.
We eventually connected with Harvey Kliman, a Yale researcher, who examined slides from Luke’s placenta and informed us that it was in the 0.01 percentile—smaller than 99.99 percent of all placentas. Luke himself was small but not overly so, and his placenta just couldn’t supply his body with enough nutrients and oxygen.
As it turned out, my immune system had attacked the placenta, a condition known as chronic histiocytic intervillositis. In normal pregnancies, Kliman explained, placentas are invisible to the mother’s immune system. No one yet understands why they are not in cases of CHI and similar conditions.
We learned about a tool called estimated placental volume (EPV), developed by Kliman, that helps measure placenta size during ultrasounds and flags when it’s too small — or too large. It’s simple and quick, yet still not widely used for reasons that remain frustratingly unclear. In Luke’s case, EPV almost certainly could have prompted an intervention that would have saved his life.
We also learned how critical it is to monitor fetal movements daily in the third trimester — slowdowns aren’t normal, even near delivery. Tracking can significantly reduce stillbirths, but no one ever emphasized this to me. Luke’s movements had been slowing for weeks, but without proper guidance, I didn’t think much of it.
I’ve heard providers avoid discussing adverse outcomes to avoid stressing mothers. It reminds me of my grandmother, who wasn’t told she was having twins in the 1940s. Over 70 years later, women are still being shielded from truths we deserve to know.
I wish we could reframe the conversation — not as fear, but as power. Parents deserve to know the risks of pregnancy and be trusted to advocate for themselves and their babies. Conditions like preeclampsia, placental disorders and cord compression are real and common. We deserve that knowledge. We deserve agency.
After Luke’s death, I used what I’d learned to protect my next pregnancy. I worked with a specialist to monitor the placenta using EPV and tracked every movement. My second son arrived healthy — but it was the most terrifying experience of my life, filled with constant fear.
No pregnancy should be a nail-biter. No one should have to hear their doctor say, “I’m afraid it means the baby has died.” No one should have to deliver a dead baby in the middle of the night. Women are smart and strong. We have tools to prevent stillbirth. Let us use them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sonogram-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 00:56:26.855314

“It’s clear to me this morning how much we have lost and how far we have fallen, and how hard it’s going to be to find our way back to each other,” said Attorney General William Tong, who lost a friend and classmate when the twin towers fell in lower Manhattan.
The message was not exactly on-brand for Tong, a Democrat who has not shied from opportunities for confrontation with President Donald Trump. He is a political pugilist, a lawyer more than willing to sue. Over everything from immigration to clean energy, Tong vows to make a fight.
“We have to find a way to have policy and political fights,” Tong said, going off topic at a press conference about his demand for documents from the WNBA related to the possible sale and relocation of the Connecticut Sun. “I use that word a lot, I know I do — fight.”
The rhetoric of politics is one of conflict and warfare, if more metaphorical than literal. But a sniper’s killing of Kirk, a charismatic 31-year-old evangelist of conservatism, as he spoke to a college audience of 3,000 in Utah is the latest in a series of attacks on political figures in the U.S.
Trump was the target of two assassination attempts. The residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was firebombed. Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked in their home. A state legislative leader in Minnesota and her husband were killed, and another lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded the same night.
Would Kirk’s death beget more violence?
“We’re sick, we’re sad, we’re angry, and we’re resolute, and we’re going to avenge Charlie’s death in the way Charlie would want it to be avenged,” conservative commentator Jesse Watters said on Fox. He did not explain how Kirk, a religious father of two, would want to be avenged.
On social media and cable, the recriminations over Kirk came fast and from all directions: The rhetoric of the left was at fault, or Kirk deserved his fate after mocking the attack on Pelosi’s husband and arguing that some shooting deaths must to be accepted rather than erode the right to bear arms. There were bipartisan efforts to tamp down such exchanges, nationally and in Connecticut.
“Nine-eleven was 24 years ago, and Charlie Kirk was assassinated less than 24 hours ago. I just want each and every one of us to look out for each other, be particularly kind,” Gov. Ned Lamont said. “There’s a lot of hateful rhetoric in the political marketplace. There’s some pretty tough rhetoric in the social media world, and this seems a pretty good day to be thoughtful, and particularly a time to look out for each other.”

His audience, manufacturers attending a conference at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford, interrupted him with applause.
Which instinct would prevail? 
The young Democratic and Republican groups in Connecticut jointly denounced the murder Wednesday, a gesture that drew attention and praise. Their adult counterparts, Democratic Chair Roberto Alves and Republican Chair Ben Proto, followed suit late Thursday afternoon.
“Now is the time for public officials and advocates to step back and think about how rhetoric impacts and influences the people around us. As leaders of our respective parties and to the leaders of our government, it is imperative that we work together on this issue,” they said in a joint communique. “Violence is unacceptable whether against a Republican or a Democrat or any one of any political belief because we disagree with the opinions they hold.  We bring about change through debate, discussion, and at the ballot box.”
Like Tong and the governor, they noted the date.
“On this day, the anniversary of one of the greatest tragedies our nation has ever suffered, we are reminded that America is at its greatest when we work together,” they said “The task is not an easy one, but America is worth the effort.”
By day’s end, there was another bipartisan call for unity — from the spouses of governors from 30 states and territories. They offered themselves as close witnesses of the contempt heaped on America’s elected leaders, men and women they love.
“The soul of America is corroded every time hateful violence or rhetoric takes root,” the spouses wrote. “Peacemakers are needed in every corner of our society, especially in our politics. Our children are watching. They desperately need us to show them a better way.”
Annie Lamont, the first lady of Connecticut, was among the signers.
Politicians acknowledged, however, a collective crouch, a fear of what might come next. Would angry voices on social media drown out the more temperate pleas for peace and reflection and serve as fuel for more violence in a nation led by a president whose insistence on a stolen election helped inspire an assault on the U.S. Capitol?
Luiz Casanova, the chief of the state Capitol police, emailed legislative leaders and their chiefs of staff Thursday morning urging them to have their members to begin advising his office of any official events away from the Capitol campus.
“This information will allow us to assess potential security needs and coordinate with local authorities, where appropriate, to provide coverage and mitigate risk,” the chief wrote.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the orientation for new lawmakers includes advice on security — and social media. His suggestion on the latter is not to engage or inflame. 
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who aggressively promotes her views on social media, will not swear off positing, but she has grown wary about engaging in on-line debates.
“It’s intense right now,” said Gilchrest, who recently announced a campaign for Congress. “As someone seeking higher office, there is a fear.”
Lamont, a Democrat who is expected to seek a third term next year, talked about a dire need to lower the temperature of American politics. 
There is no thermostat that can make that happen. 
Proto, the GOP state chair, signed the statement with Alves, but he was pessimistic in an interview earlier Thursday about taking down the heat, especially in the pundit class and on social media. 
“Do we need to turn it down? Yeah,” Proto said. “Do we have the ability to turn it down?”
Without mirth, Proto recalled the jokes in the earliest days of Twitter and Facebook about social media one day being the undoing of democracy.
“Well, we’re watching it,” Proto said. “We’re watching it happen.”
Kirk’s death showed signs of resonating more widely and loudly than some other recent acts of political violence. 
The attack was captured on video. He was upbeat and marveled at the size of the crowd, some of whom likely there to accept his invitation to debate his defense of gun rights and all things Trump, a gambit that added to his draw on college campuses. 
“He was doing the right thing when he was murdered,” said state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, who just began a run for governor. “He was using his words to reach out to people who disagree with him in places he was most likely to find them, college campuses.”
Kirk took questions. The last one in Utah was, “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”
His reply: “Counting or not counting gang violence?”
There was a single shot, Kirk fell and his audience fled in confused panic. 
Fazio, more or less a contemporary at 35, said he appreciated the column published in the New York Times by Ezra Klein, a liberal thinker. The headline was, “Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way.”
Causal observers on the left might dismiss Kirk, who began organizing as an 18-year-old college student, as just another right-wing provocateur, loyal to Trump and hostile to liberal causes, transgender rights among them.
“You can dislike much of what Kirk believed and the following statement is still true: Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” Klein wrote. “He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion. When the left thought its hold on the hearts and minds of college students was nearly absolute, Kirk showed up again and again to break it.”
Fazio said Kirk was a cultural phenomenon, drawing Gen Z to conservative causes — or inspiring liberal ones to oppose them. Proto agreed, saying, “He clearly was the instigator in getting younger Millennials and Gen Zers engaged in this conversation.”
Rep. Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford, the leader of the Republican minority in the Connecticut House, said, “I was getting phone calls from my kids. This one really struck them.”
Tong offered public condolences.
“I want to say how sorry I am to the family of Charlie Kirk, how sorry I am for the loss of Charlie Kirk, to the people that loved and supported him. We should all be able to say that,” Tong said. “Everyone has a right to be safe.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-7.32.34-PM.png,,,2025-09-11 21:57:13.608705

(Photo provided by ConocoPhillips)A report published by the Alaska Department of Revenue last month says the state treasury will benefit far less from the new Willow oil project than previously estimated.
According to the department’s new estimate, Alaska’s state treasury will net $2.6 billion from the development between 2029, when Willow is expected to begin producing oil, and 2053, the end of its expected productive life.
That’s down 50% from $5.2 billion expected in a 2024 estimate, and from $6.3 billion forecast in a 2023 estimate.
Fairbanks writer Dermot Cole first noted the decline on his website.
Under all three estimates, Willow’s operator, ConocoPhillips, would receive more in state-paid tax credits than it generates the state in tax revenue.
Under Alaska’s current oil tax system, oilfield developers receive tax credits for their lease expenses — the cost of drilling for new oil or producing from an existing field. 
Those credits can be applied against production taxes elsewhere on the North Slope, or on oil from a new well, reducing the amount of money the state receives in taxes.
The new estimate lowers the expected price of oil and increases the cost of production across the North Slope, thus increasing the amount of tax reductions that could be applied to North Slope oil. It also takes into account a slightly different development plan that reduces expected production by 6%.
“Of these changes,” the department wrote in an emailed response to questions, “the increase in slope-wide lease expenditures had the greatest impact on state revenue.”
The department confirmed that the amount of tax reductions exceeds the new projected state revenue from Willow.
“Yes, in our Willow project analysis the total tax credits applied against tax liability over the duration of the analysis do exceed the revenue to the state from the Willow project over the duration of the analysis,” the department said by email. “This is true under both the 2024 and 2025 versions of the analysis. These credits do not represent cash out the door but rather an offset to taxes due based on the volume of oil produced.”
Willow is the largest oil and gas development to date on federal land within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, to the west of Prudhoe Bay. 
That area, believed to be home to significant oil reserves, is almost entirely untapped, and some state officials have said they believe that revenue from NPR-A would be particularly important as the state tries to bring expenses and revenue in line over future years.
The new estimate diminishes that hope. It predicts that peak production in 2030, Willow will be generating less than $300 million per year for the state treasury.
The state of Alaska isn’t the project’s only fiscal beneficiary. Under federal and state laws, 16.67% of production is paid in royalties to the federal government, with half of that money being redirected to the state, which uses it for grants to North Slope Borough communities.
This year, $31 million was split across four communities and the North Slope Borough.
Over the next 27 years, the state estimates those communities and the borough will share $3.1 billion. The borough itself will receive $1.2 billion from local property taxes. The federal government would receive $5.8 billion.
ConocoPhillips, the producer, would receive $10.3 billion, the state estimates. That’s up from $9.8 billion in the 2024 estimate and $9.9 billion in the 2023 one.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan joined fellow Senate Republicans Wednesday night in voting to set aside a budget amendment that would have compelled the U.S. Department of Justice to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The vote to table the amendment, stopping the Senate from considering it, was 51-49. 
All of the Senate’s Democrats voted in favor of the amendment, as did Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rand Paul of Kentucky.
The failure of either of Alaska’s Republican senators to vote for the amendment drew criticism from the Alaska Democratic Party.

Murkowski, talking by phone on Thursday, said the amendment, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, came as a surprise, and she voted against it for procedural reasons, not because she opposes the idea of a release.
“What Schumer did was nothing more than a political stunt,” Murkowski said.
In July, Murkowski and other members of a Senate budget subcommittee voted unanimously to amend a proposed appropriations bill to mandate that the U.S. Department of Justice compile a report on the activities of Epstein, a sex trafficker with extensive ties to rich and powerful people worldwide. Epstein died in jail while awaiting trial in 2019. 
The final text of the bill requires a report, but not the release of original documents in the possession of the federal government.
President Donald Trump campaigned on releasing the documents during last year’s presidential election, but this summer has since broken that campaign pledge, downplaying the case 
In February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she had Epstein’s client list “sitting on my desk right now.” But in July the FBI announced in a memo that there was no “client list” and no more public information would be released. The announcement caused a public outcry, and the federal government still has not released the documents.
Trump’s social relationship with Epstein was well-documented, and this week, the Wall Street Journal published a copy of a birthday greeting Trump sent to Epstein in 2003. Trump has claimed the letter doesn’t exist, but it bears his signature.
The letter was released to the public after being obtained by U.S. House members investigating the Epstein case.
“I have been — I don’t know if it’s fair to say one of the rare Republicans — certainly a very early Republican on the Senate side who said, ‘Look, just, just release these Epstein files. Just get this stuff out there,” Murkowski said.
The appropriations bill with Murkowski’s preferred Epstein language would fund the U.S. Department of Justice and other commerce and science-related parts of the federal government. For that reason, it’s been nicknamed the “CJS bill.”
It has not yet come to a floor vote, and with senators hurrying to pass budget bills before the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, it isn’t clear when it will come up.
“Will we see the CJS as part of a floor package that could move through the Senate? It’s not impossible, but we are kind of running out of daylight,” Murkowski said.
Part of that uncertainty is due to Senate Democrats’ opposition to the overall contents of the bill. That opposition has slowed the bill’s progress.
Schumer’s amendment would have forced the Senate to debate the Epstein issue immediately, as part of the annual defense authorization bill now under debate.
In response to a request for comment, Sullivan’s office issued a written statement that also criticized Schumer’s amendment and defended his vote.
It said in part, “Senator Sullivan has repeatedly said that he believes the DOJ should release as much information as possible on Epstein’s horrific crimes, while protecting survivors. Chuck Schumer tried slipping the Epstein provision into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), knowing full well it would be stripped out as the bill went through the process, leaving no doubt he’s using Epstein’s atrocious crimes as a political pawn instead of focusing on building up our military in the NDAA, which Schumer has never shown any interest in doing.”
Murkowski said the amendment disrupted normal work on the defense bill and “threw a real wrench into the whole negotiated process that had really been moving along in a positive way.”
She said she believes Schumer brought up the Epstein issue because Senate Republicans are preparing to change the rules for the confirmation of Trump’s executive-branch nominations.
Ordinarily, the Senate approves uncontroversial nominees without a roll-call vote to make the process more efficient. Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, none of his nominees have been approved without a roll-call vote, an unprecedented change in the Senate, and one that has slowed both the Senate and the Trump administration’s confirmations.
In response, Senate Republicans are planning to change the Senate’s rules to allow the approval of multiple nominees with a single vote.
“I think he was trying to kind of change the narrative,” Murkowski said of Schumer’s proposed amendment. “I don’t think he was making much headway on his pushback on some of the nominations. And he made a decision that, I think, is going to be short-lived in its political fire. He really kind of poisoned the waters around here in terms of good-faith negotiations.”
The day after the vote, Alaska Democratic Party Chair Eric Croft released a statement, saying by email: “Just two months ago, Dan Sullivan called on the Department of Justice to release the documents to shine a light on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific crimes. But last night, Dan Sullivan was a deciding vote to continue the cover-up and block an effort to force the DOJ to release the Epstein files. Instead of listening to Alaskans and the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, Sullivan acted in his usual fashion – like a spineless politician who’s only loyal to his billionaire buddies. Alaskans and survivors deserve better.”
Sullivan faces re-election in 2026 and is running for another term in Congress.
To date, no Democrat has filed with the Alaska Division of Elections to challenge Sullivan. Filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Republican Christopher Miklos of Homer and Democrat Ann Diener of Fairbanks have filed forms necessary to begin fundraising.
The U.S. House, meanwhile, is close to having enough support to force a vote on the Epstein issue. While Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, opposes bringing up the topic, a bipartisan petition could override the Speaker if it has 218 signatures. As of Wednesday night, it had 217. Alaska’s lone member of the House of Representatives, Rep. Nick Begich, has not signed the discharge petition. His office did not respond to questions about his position on the Epstein issue and whether he will sign the petition.

The incident occurred a day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at a university event in Utah.
“I know that people are on edge – it’s a scary time … in the midst of an escalating pattern of political violence in Michigan and in America,” Gilchrist said. “The purpose of this violence is to silence, intimidate, and eliminate people and their voices from our society.

A spokesperson for the city of Detroit said that State Police were handling media inquires regarding the incident when asked if the city’s police and fire departments responded to Gilchrist’s home on Thursday.

Gilchrist, who is also a candidate for governor in 2026, added that the nation and Michigan “cannot tolerate political violence.” 
“We cannot excuse it. We cannot normalize it,” he said. “We have to push through this and do the work to do better. It’s not easy, but nothing important ever is. It’s up to us to dig deep and commit to ending violence and creating a safe, healthy society.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also commented on the incident on social media.
“I’m grateful that Lt. Governor Gilchrist and his family are safe after the bomb threat at his home today,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Let me be clear – political violence is unacceptable and has no place in Michigan. As Michiganders, we must reject all political violence and work towards a safer future.”
Reports of bomb threats were documented around the nation on Thursday, including against New Mexico’s Democratic Senate and House leaders, and numerous historically Black colleges and university campuses. Rhode Island State Police also said they were investigating bomb threats against top Senate Democrats on Thursday afternoon, however, the law enforcement agency said the emailed threats appeared to be hoaxes.

By Ryan Colasanti, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE Sports
MIDDLETOWN, Del. — After a grueling start against nationally respected opponents, the Middletown Cavaliers will once again defend Delaware’s football reputation when they host Our Lady of Good Counsel (Md.) this Friday at 7 p.m.
Delaware teams are a combined 5–6 against out-of-state competition this season, and Middletown accounts for two of those six defeats. Both losses came on the road—narrow setbacks against Ohio’s Bishop Watterson and New Jersey’s Red Bank Catholic by a combined margin of just six points. The Cavaliers’ defense shined in both contests, holding each opponent to just two touchdowns, but the offense fell just short in the closing minutes.
Middletown isn’t the only team carrying the state banner in these regional matchups. Last week, Salesianum hosted Pennsylvania powerhouse La Salle College High School in a hard-fought non-conference game on September 5 in Wilmington. The game was tied 14–14 at halftime, and Salesianum briefly grabbed a third-quarter lead with a 30-yard field goal to make it 17–14. But La Salle answered with two fourth-quarter touchdowns to pull away, sealing a 28–17 victory before a crowd of more than 1,000 fans. Strong defensive stands and strategic punting highlighted a contest that showed Delaware’s top programs are willing to test themselves against elite out-of-state foes.
Now Middletown returns home for its third and final out-of-state matchup of the year, looking to turn near-misses into a statement victory. The challenge will be steep. Good Counsel, a perennial power from the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, arrives undefeated at 2–0 after impressive wins over opponents from Florida and New Jersey. The Falcons reached last year’s WCAC championship game, defeating Gonzaga High School in the semifinals before falling to DeMatha.

(Photo by Columbia River System Operations EIS)Northwest states, tribes and environmental groups will resume suing the federal government over its hydroelectric dam operations in the Columbia River Basin that have harmed endangered native fish species. 
The move comes after the Trump administration in June withdrew from a “historic” deal made two years ago, when President Joe Biden was in office. This agreement called for putting long-running legal battles aside and investing in the restoration of endangered Columbia River fish runs. 
Behind the litigation are 10 environmental groups backed by Oregon, Washington and four Lower Columbia River tribes: The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe. 
Court fights over the dams had gone on for more than three decades before the pause. Now, they are back on, according to Amanda Goodin, an attorney with the environmental law group Earthjustice, which filed a motion Thursday in U.S. District Court in Oregon to end the multi-year pause on a 2021 lawsuit. 
“The Trump administration’s recent actions leave us with no choice but to return to court,” she said. 
On Oct. 8, Earthjustice will officially resume its lawsuit, spokesperson Elizabeth Manning said. 
Earthjustice’s plaintiffs include the National Wildlife Federation, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Institute for Fisheries Resources, Sierra Club, Idaho Rivers United, Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association, NW Energy Coalition, Columbia Riverkeeper, Idaho Conservation League and Fly Fishers International, Inc.   
Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a statement that Oregon, too, was ready to resume legal action. 
“The federal government has put salmon and steelhead on the brink of extinction and once again broken promises to tribal partners. Extinction is not an option. Oregon will return to court to hold the federal government accountable and ensure these iconic fish runs have a future,” he said.
White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday. 
The 2023 Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement involved pausing active Snake River litigation for a minimum of five years while the federal government worked with tribes and states on a plan to advance recovery of native fish populations in the Columbia Basin. 
At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. 
The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
“These wild native fish are essential to tribal cultures and important to sport, commercial, and tribal fishing communities and economies throughout the Pacific Northwest.  We can and must do better,” said Bill Arthur, the director of the Sierra Club’s campaign to protect salmon in the Snake and Columbia rivers. 
The Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative included a roadmap for salmon and steelhead recovery, as well as steps to replace the energy, transportation, irrigation, and recreation services provided by the four lower Snake River dams so they could potentially be breached. 
The agreement was a way to increase salmon populations and fishing opportunities while improving public services, cutting taxpayer subsidies and meeting promises made to the tribes, according to Mike Leahy, senior director of wildlife, hunting and fishing policy for the National Wildlife Federation. 
In June, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum withdrawing the federal government’s support from the agreement, calling it “radical environmentalism” and saying completion of the restoration initiative would “be devastating for the region.” 
“It’s been disappointing to see the federal government overrule all the progress made in the region in favor of returning to court,” Leahy said. 
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement that renewing the lawsuit is necessary to protect natural resources, preserve fish runs, and hold the federal government responsible.
“President Trump walking away from these commitments presents a very real threat at a time when the fish are on the brink of extinction. It also continues our nation’s shameful legacy of broken promises to sovereign tribal nations that this partnership sought to repair,” she said.
While environmental groups agree that going back to court is an essential next step, they have committed to finding other ways to continue restoring the Columbia Basin while the lawsuits are ongoing. 
“We will nevertheless keep working with sovereigns and stakeholders across the Northwest to find real solutions to restore healthy, abundant salmon and bring our communities forward together,” said Columbia Riverkeeper Legal Director Miles Johnson.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iceharbor-dam-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 20:56:37.467907

(Screenshot from Arkansas PBS YouTube channel)Homeschooled children account for nearly 40% of those approved to participate in Arkansas’ Educational Freedom Account program this school year, according to figures presented to the State Board of Education Thursday.
Darrell Smith, assistant commissioner in the Office of School Choice and Parent Empowerment, told board members 18,420 of the 46,634 students approved for EFA participation this fall are homeschooled. The school choice office is part of the state Education Department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Arkansas’ public school student population by comparison is 474,337, according to the ADE Data Center.
Smith said the number of homeschooled students in the voucher program represents about 50% of the estimated homeschooled student population.
The Educational Freedom Account program has provided state money for allowable education expenses since its creation under the LEARNS Act in 2023. The program has been phased in over three years with increasing eligibility and is open to all students for the first time this fall. Private school tuition is one of the allowable education expenses for students who receive the roughly $7,000 each the state will provide in the 2025-26 school year.
Since the state funds go to the student’s family, students in microschools also are eligible. Smith said 100 microschools are registered with the education department. Arkansas defines a microschool as “a tuition-based organization that serves a community of homeschool students, simultaneously in the same space, and that maintains responsibility for employing instructors or facilitators to provide part-time or full-time academic services.”
Smith told the state education board that 162 private schools and 28,214 private school students are approved EFA participants this academic year.
Asked how his office assures that schools don’t gouge parents with hefty tuition increases because of the state funding, Smith said his staff requires schools to provide a history of tuition increases and makes sure the schools have “a legitimate, rational reason” for any increases. His office also analyzes each school’s cost of educating a child to determine if any increases are in line with additional costs.
“We’re not just taking them at their word,” Smith said.
Under EFA program rules, the Department of Education may prohibit schools from participating in the program if the department determines tuition or fee increases “are unreasonable or arbitrary.”
Smith said the department doesn’t give schools an upper limit or maximum percentage by which tuition can increase, adding that the policy is “one way we can hold private schools accountable.”
During his report on EFA participation, Smith said 17% of this year’s approved students are those with disabilities. Students with disabilities were among the first eligible when the program started in the 2023-2024 school year.
Another 17% of voucher recipients this year are children of veterans and first responders, he said. Children of law enforcement officers and active duty military each account for 2% of participants. 
Another 2% are students from public schools with “D” or “F” grades, according to a chart Smith presented. Students in foster care represent 4% of voucher recipients, and roughly 0.3% are homeless, the chart showed.

The change comes as the Trump administration continues pushing for increased resource utilization of public lands, including through logging and mining.[...]","A Bureau of Land Management office in Billings, Montana. The office also includes the Billings Office of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montana)The federal government on Wednesday proposed rescinding a Bureau of Land Management rule that allows the department to consider conservation as part of its multi-pronged approach to federal land management.
The change comes as the Trump administration continues pushing for increased resource utilization of public lands, including through logging and mining.
The proposal drew immediate reactions from Montanans — with political leaders praising the reversal as helpful to energy production but conservation groups decrying it as another harm to public lands access.
“President Trump and Secretary Burgum are bringing back commonsense land management policies that will benefit Montana farmers, ranchers, and producers,” Montana U.S. Sen Steve Daines said. “The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing, and forest management. By rescinding the Public Lands Rule and unlocking more timber sales in Montana, we’ll be better able to manage our forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires. President Trump is committed to Treasure State priorities and this is welcome news.”
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a department press release that the “Public Lands Rule” exceeded BLM’s authority and placed an “outsized priority” on conservation use of federal land, threatening energy development, grazing and recreation use.
“The previous administration’s Public Lands Rule had the potential to block access to hundreds of thousands of acres of multiple-use land – preventing energy and mineral production, timber management, grazing and recreation across the West,” Burgum said. “The most effective caretakers of our federal lands are those whose livelihoods rely on its well-being. Overturning this rule protects our American way of life and gives our communities a voice in the land that they depend on.”
The Biden-era rule, formally the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, went into effect in spring of 2024, as a way to better define how the BLM approaches land management decisions. According to the final decision in the federal register, the rule helped clarify the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, by letting the department protect “intact, functioning landscapes;” offer restoration and mitigation leases, alongside grazing and extraction leases, to restore degraded habitats and ecosystems; and emphasize landscape health in decision making by utilizing science and data, including Indigenous Knowledge.
“The rule does not prioritize conservation above other multiple uses. It also does not preclude other uses where conservation use is occurring. Many uses are compatible with different types of conservation use, such as sustainable recreation, grazing, and habitat management. The rule also does not enable conservation use to occur in places where an existing, authorized, and incompatible use is occurring,” the final rule states.
The rule drew the ire of industry groups and politicians across the west, including Burgum, then-Gov. of North Dakota, and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who along with the state of Idaho sued the federal government over the conservation rule. The BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land across Montana and the two Dakotas.
Conservation and recreation organizations, along with an overwhelming majority of the public that weighed in on the rule, supported allowing conservation and restoration to be considered more actively by federal land management agencies. According to an analysis by the Center for Western Priorities, 92% of more than 150,000 public comments supported the rule.
Outdoor-oriented policy and advocacy groups, including the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and the National Parks Conservation Association released statements opposing the change en masse on Wednesday.
“Every one of this administration’s public-lands policies is designed to sell out public access, recreation, clean water, and wildlife to boost corporate profits. ‘Multiple-use’ doesn’t mean that oil and gas corporations get to dictate what happens to our public lands,” said Aubrey Bertraim, federal policy director of Wild Montana. “Rolling back the Public Lands Rule is another way to cut out public input, undermine local management, and give industry and billionaires control of the places where we hike, hunt, fish, camp, and ride. Who cares if that hurts regular Montanans? It’s time to call this what it is: The latest move in a systematic approach to dismantle the public lands that support our way of life.”
The Outdoor Industry Association in a press release said the change would hurt economies and businesses that rely heavily on the outdoor recreation industry.
“America’s public lands are the engine of the $1.2 trillion outdoor economy and should be protected so future generations can continue hiking, climbing, and recreating in our most cherished places,” Outdoor Industry Association president Kent Ebersole said. “The rescission of the public lands rule would not only prevent accessible outdoor recreation on these vital lands but also hurt the small businesses and gateway communities that rely on it. The outdoor industry urges the administration to reconsider this decision and protect the landscapes that are vital to local economies, small businesses, and the outdoor recreation community.”
Many opponents of the Public Lands Rule claim it excluded grazing, extraction and recreation in favor of conservation, but the rule specifically states that it “does not prioritize conservation” above other uses, but puts them on equal footing in decision making. The text of the rule describes how conservation is an essential piece of the planning and management process. As an example, the rule states that a restoration lease could be paired with a grazing lease to allow tracts of public land to recover between periods of grazing.
But the Interior Department said rolling back the rule will also offer a more stable future for extraction and energy industry stakeholders concerned about litigation or permitting delays that could be brought forth under the rule.
“The rescission of the Public Lands Rule will eliminate unnecessary barriers to energy development and support the multiple-use mandate of the BLM by not prioritizing conservation over all other uses,” according to the Interior Department.
Rich Nolan, President and CEO of the National Mining Association, praised the move, saying the Biden had “unlawfully placed conservation above all else.

“This new rule reinstates the balance of federal land use intended by Congress, ensuring that our vast resources can meet today’s soaring energy needs and become the secure mineral supply chains for American industry,” Nolan said in a statement.
According to the BLM website, the policy on restoration and mitigation leasing has already been declared inactive as of Feb 27 of this year, following one of Trump’s executive orders from early in his term.

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey unveiled a new comprehensive energy plan for West Virginia on Wednesday, which will largely rely on doubling down on and increasing power generated from the state’s nonrenewable energy sources like coal and natural gas.
The plan — dubbed the “50 by 50” generation plan by Morrisey — aims to see the state increase its power capacity from the current 15 gigawatt generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050. Morrisey said increased generation is necessary so the PJM — the massive power grid network that West Virginia feeds into — can meet estimated future demands.
Morrisey noted that, by 2045, it’s estimated that there will be a 70 gigawatt increase in peak load demand from the PJM, which serves West Virginia along with 12 other states. Meanwhile, he said, it’s projected that about 40 GW of the PJM’s generating capacity may be retired by 2030.
“Within the next 20 years PJM will likely need 110 GW of new generation capacity just to keep pace with demand growth and aging retirements. Currently, very few states within PJM can produce enough power to meet their own needs, much less export power to other states. West Virginia is one of those states,” Morrisey said. “[W]hile West Virginia is a national leader in per-capita electricity exports, we lack the existing generation capacity to meet future needs.”
To reach his goal of 50 gigawatt generating capacity, Morrisey said the state will prioritize growing its “stable baseload generation over renewables” through continued reliance on coal and natural gas as well as nuclear energy. 
“Baseload generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear are critical to our way of life,” Morrisey said. “It provides a stable backbone to the grid, ensuring there is always a dependable supply of electricity.”
West Virginia currently has no nuclear energy developments operating. In 2022, however, lawmakers passed a bill repealing the state’s previous ban on nuclear energy, paving the way for future generation. 
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, West Virginia has five “multiple unit small modular reaction plants” that are scheduled to be in operation by 2025. Appalachian Power, the state’s largest electric company, is currently in the process of creating a small modular reactor in Virginia.
Morrisey said that he not only wants to keep the state’s current coal plants operational, but he also plans to explore options for newly created coal-generated power plants.
“West Virginia has numerous coal plants that have powered this country for decades. We need these plants to remain operational,” Morrisey said. “… We will never turn our backs on our existing coal plants and we will work with the federal government to pursue new coal-fired generation.”
Most of the state’s existing coal plants were commissioned decades ago and upgraded since then to remain operational. No new large coal-fired power plants have been commissioned in West Virginia or elsewhere in the United States in over 10 years.
Morrisey said West Virginia’s coal industry has been a “cornerstone of electricity generation” and has helped ensure “affordable and reliable power” in the state.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.
National security and the race for artificial intelligence, data center developments
Morrisey’s remarks heavily focused on threats facing the U.S. from China, Russia and elsewhere. Namely, he said that “energy is being used by our adversaries to threaten the American way of life.”
“China, Russia and Iran are three of the largest energy producing countries in the world and three of our nation’s biggest adversaries,” Morrisey said. “They are coordinating diplomatically, militarily, and economically to weaken American influence and build an alternative global order.“
Specifically, Morrisey said, the country needs to ensure it is competing with and protecting itself from China, which is a massive coal-fired power generator and “dominates” mineral supply chains.
“China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of critical data to China instead of to the United States,” Morrisey said. “America can either find a way to dramatically increase its power production, or China will eclipse our nation in a technological battle that will undermine our national security.”
Data centers, Morrisey continued, are central to this “battle.” He said the state has partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to assist with “crafting our data center development strategy.”
But several data centers are already proposed to be developed in West Virginia. Permits for some have already been approved. Several of these data centers will be powered by “microgrids,” which operate separate from existing utilities. This was made possible during the 2025 legislative session, where lawmakers passed House Bill 2014 allowing these microgrids to be established.
That legislation also included language to stop localities from enforcing zoning laws and other ordinances — like ones for noise and light pollution — against the developments.
From Tucker County to the state’s Southern Coalfields, residents have started organizing in an attempt to stop these developments. They’re worried about how they will impact their communities through unhealthy emissions and massive water consumption, which they fear will threaten their own water supplies.
Morrisey said Wednesday that the state needs to “ensure” that the “rapid innovation and demand” from data centers does not “negatively impact” residents. He did not outline what those negative impacts would be or how they would be avoided. 
Environmental advocates decry lack of renewable energy in state strategy
While Morrisey said that every kind of energy needs to be embraced in order to meet electricity demand, he said the place for renewable energy — like solar and wind — is limited.
He cited the state’s lack of “flat land” and a study showing that West Virginia, on average, does not have a high number of “annual sunlight hours.”
Solar power, generally, does not need year-round sunlight to create power. When electricity is generated from solar, it can be stored in batteries for use on overcast days and at night.
Shawn Phillips, with the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, said it was insulting to hear Morrisey call West Virginia’s energy “affordable” and coal “common sense” since power bills in the state continue to climb. Meanwhile, largely under Republican leadership, West Virginia has refused to invest in or grow its renewable energy sector.
Just this year, lawmakers proposed legislation to prohibit all wind power projects, establish new taxes for electricity from wind and solar projects, limit the number of wind projects allowed in a year, eliminate all subsidies for renewable energy projects, and increase taxes on wind turbines.
Current policies ban community solar, which allow residents and businesses to join a nearby solar project and lower their electricity prices from utilities. Bills to repeal this ban have repeatedly failed at the Legislature.
Phillips said that if West Virginia wants to make energy affordable and reliable, the state needs to explore its options with renewable energy forms.
“Coal is an unreliable fuel — it’s aging, breaking down, and driving prices up,” Phillips said. “Renewables are the fastest, cheapest, and most dependable sources we can build today. Fossil fuels don’t just drain wallets — they poison our air and water. Propping them up means West Virginians pay twice: once on their bills, and again with their health.”
Jillian Welsh, communications coordinator for the state Environmental Council, echoed Phillips’ points. If energy affordability is the goal, Welsh said, then “renewables have to be front and center.”
“Wind, solar and [battery] storage are the fastest, cheapest resources to build, and leaving them out makes [Morrisey’s] plan obsolete on day one,” Welsh said. “Chasing ‘50 by 50’ by tripling coal, gas and nuclear is a recipe for higher bills and dirtier air — not progress.”
Welsh noted that Morrisey did not once mention the growing impacts of climate change in the region or any move to cut carbon emissions, which can threaten residents’ health and contribute to climate change.
West Virginia is already home to the ninth highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the nation, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. As a whole, the state was the 12th highest emitter nationally for greenhouse gases in 2023.
Currently proposed natural gas power plants would contribute more emissions into the atmosphere. In Mingo County, two proposed methane-powered plants would become the state’s third and fourth largest power plants once built, behind only the John E. Amos plant and the Harrison Power Station. Those power plants, if approved, are planned to power two data centers and an ammonium plant. 
As they would operate as microgrids, local governments would have no say or power over their operations.
“Communities get no say over whether they want massive new plants in their backyards. There’s barely a nod [in Morrisey’s address] to protecting air, water and health — and not a word on mountaintop removal,” Welsh said. “And while the governor warns about China, he ignores the fact that China is leading a solar revolution that’s making energy cheaper. At the same time, West Virginians are being told to foot the bill for outdated, polluting power.”

Ferguson will appoint a new justice, his first appointment to the state Supreme Court. An election will be held next year to complete the remainder of Yu’s term, which runs through Dec. 31, 2028.
“It is not an easy decision to step away,” she wrote in the letter. “I have had the good fortune of serving the people of our great state as a judge for 25 years and have cherished every single moment of such service.”

Yu highlighted the time she’s spent “mentoring and teaching those younger than me to embrace life, lead, and to make a difference.”
“They cherish the rule of law, and they will defend and protect the courts that I love so deeply,” she said.
Chief Justice Debra Stephens called Yu “a dynamic leader,” praising her work as a mentor of new lawyers and a champion of racial justice through her leadership on the Washington State Minority and Justice Commission.
“She has served the people of Washington with passion, intellect and boundless energy,” Stephens said in a statement.
Ferguson said in a statement that during her time on the bench, Yu has demonstrated her commitment to respect, dignity and fairness for all.” 
“Her legacy is in bending Washington state further toward justice,” he said.
Trailblazing career
Yu was raised in Bridgeport, a South Side neighborhood in Chicago, by immigrant parents. Her mother came from Mexico and her father from China. She is the first in her family to graduate from college, according to her official biography.
When Gov. Jay Inslee appointed her to the state Supreme Court on May 16, 2014, Yu became the first Asian, the first Latina and the first member of the LGBTQ community to serve on the court. She went on to win elections in 2014, 2016 and 2022.
Before reaching the state’s high court, the trailblazing Yu had etched her place into state history.
At midnight on Dec. 9, 2012, when same-sex couples could begin to legally marry in Washington state, several lined up outside a Seattle courtroom to have Yu, then a King County Superior Court judge, preside over their nuptials.
Sarah and Emily Cofer of Snohomish County were first up.
“Judge Yu was warm and welcoming. She presided over the ceremony with comfort and joy that made it feel like a personal event even in such a public setting,” Sarah Cofer recounted in a biography of Yu in the “Love, Equally” exhibit marking the history of marriage equality in Washington.
Yu worked more than 14 years as a trial court judge in King County Superior Court after serving as deputy chief of staff to former King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.
In her letter to Ferguson, Yu said personal events over the past year “have shed a new light on how I might want to spend the next 25 years of my life.”
Yu, in a phone interview Thursday, said two events catalyzed her decision. Last year, an early detection of breast cancer led to two surgeries and she is now “completely healthy.” Then, in March, Justice Susan Owens passed away at age 75, just three months after retiring from the bench.
“I thought, life just can’t end this way for me. I want to travel. I want to teach.

If financial strain closed the hospital, it would leave “a big hole in Southwest Arkansas,” Chief Administrative Officer Shelby Brown said.
“Right now, we have more money going out than we have money coming in,” Brown told the Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee, which met Thursday morning at the hospital.
Brown and Republican Rep. Dolly Henley, who represents Hope and serves on the House Public Health committee, both said they have asked Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her staff to visit the hospital and help them come up with financial solutions. Sanders, who was born in Hope, has not yet visited the facility, Brown and Henley said.

The Legislature distributed nearly $60 million in federal pandemic relief funds to 17 rural hospitals deemed eligible for the aid between 2022 and 2024. Hope’s hospital, then called Wadley Regional Medical Center, did not receive aid from this subset of COVID-19 relief funds.
Medicare and Medicaid make up roughly a combined 66% of the hospital’s payers, Brown said, and many “people who are really at risk see us as their primary care provider.”
The hospital gets paid $12 per Medicaid patient who uses its emergency room for non-emergent primary care, she said.
She also said Southwest Arkansas Regional has applied to be a critical access hospital, a federal designation for facilities located no less than 35 miles from other hospitals and maintaining no more than 25 beds. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsidizes critical access hospitals for inpatient treatment of Medicare recipients.
If CMS approves Southwest Arkansas Regional’s application, it will have to reduce its inpatient beds from 48 to 25. The hospital will also be required to retain intensive care patients for no longer than an average of 96 hours.
Brown said she and other hospital administrators considered seeking rural emergency hospital status, which draws more federal funds to rural hospitals if they reduce or eliminate inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment.
“But if we did that, you have to get rid of all your acute beds, and the community decided that’s not where we need to be,” Brown said.
The Hempstead County Quorum Court and the Hope board of directors each passed resolutions in June 2024 pledging $1,000,000 to support the hospital in 10 installments of $100,000 per month.

 More services needed

After the committee meeting, Brown and Pafford employees led lawmakers on a brief tour of the facility, including the intensive care unit and a Pafford ambulance.
The ICU is technically separate from the hospital and is owned and operated by Pafford, Brown said. The hospital also has a geriatric psychiatric ward.
The hospital wants to add services, such as colonoscopies, “but we need to get our feet planted and financially stable” first, Brown said.
About 25% of local ambulance calls result in a patient refusing to be transferred to a hospital, and this creates expenses with no attached revenue stream, said Pafford marketing director Suzy Barham and Arkansas Ambulance Association President Amanda Newton.
In addition to becoming a critical access hospital, Southwest Arkansas Regional is also in the process of becoming a nonprofit. This will help repay some of the money the Pafford family has invested in keeping the hospital afloat, Brown said, and it will make the hospital eligible for the federal 340B discount prescription drug pricing program.
Lawmakers and local law enforcement officers said another potential revenue stream for the hospital would be mental health services if it had the funding to provide such care. About 20% of county jail inmates in Miller County, Hempstead County’s neighbor to the west, need mental health treatment, Miller County Sheriff Wayne Easley said.
Texarkana, Arkansas, is the Miller County seat and no longer has a hospital, leaving Southwest Arkansas Regional as the closest facility. Texarkana Police Chief Ed Chattaway and Hope Police Chief Kimberly Tomlin both said Hope’s hospital could be a good point of intervention for people whose mental health struggles attract police attention.

“If they aren’t breaking the law and they’re in that limbo spot before something happens, sometimes you have to walk away from people that you know need something,” Tomlin said.
Arkansas has three crisis stabilization units — located in Little Rock, Fort Smith and Jonesboro — established in 2017 as alternatives to incarceration for people with substance use and mental health issues.
Sen. Missy Irvin, a Mountain View Republican and the Senate chair of the Public Health committee, said the units are underfunded and mental health resources need a stronger support system.
“We have to have a collaboration and a partnership to go back and see what’s working, where it’s working and how it’s working,” Irvin said. “It’s going to require a commitment and spend from the Legislature, in my opinion, and I think it’s a worthy spend.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shelby-Brown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 19:57:57.363547

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Teresa Little, Idaho’s first lady and wife of Gov. Brad Little, has joined dozens of other spouses of U.S. governors in a call for unity and to condemn political violence across the nation.
She, along with 34 other first spouses across the U.S., signed on to a letter dated Sept. 11 to call on Americans to “listen more, eliminate hate and find connection and healing” after highly publicized acts of political violence have rocked the country within the last year.
Manhunt for Charlie Kirk shooter: Rifle found, person of interest photos released

The call comes one day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem and three months after Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband was shot and killed by an assailant in their home. That attacker also shot Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, but they survived.
A shooter also fired on U.S. President Donald Trump, and a bystander was killed, at a campaign rally in July 2024 in Pennsylvania before the attacker was shot and killed by the U.S. Secret Service.
“As First Spouses of states and territories across the country, we are in a unique position to both witness and experience the contempt that has permeated our culture,” the first spouses wrote. “Today, we stand together — across political backgrounds — to condemn political violence of every kind.”
The first spouses wrote that they are committed to seeing every American “as a person with inherent dignity and worth,” and that the U.S. system of democracy and unity as a country depends on Americans finding common ground with one another.
“The soul of America is corroded every time hateful rhetoric or violence takes root. Peacemakers are needed in every corner of our society, especially in our politics,” the group wrote. “Our children are watching. They desperately need us to show them a better way.”

(Courtesy of University of South Dakota)South Dakota public university enrollment this fall is 36,091 students, exactly the same as last fall, according to numbers released Thursday by the South Dakota Board of Regents.
Enrollment dropped for two universities and increased by less than 3% at four others:

Black Hills State University in Spearfish increased by 2.36% to 3,425 students.
Dakota State University in Madison grew by 1.8% to 3,842 students.
Northern State University in Aberdeen grew by 0.84% to 3,739 students.
South Dakota Mines in Rapid City decreased by 1.47% to 2,541 students.
South Dakota State University in Brookings grew by 0.61% to 12,139 students.
University of South Dakota in Vermillion decreased by 2.02% to 10,405 students.

System-wide enrollment peaked at 36,662 in 2017, and no year since then has equaled that mark.


The numbers could be a sign of the “2025 cliff” that officials have been fearing, attributed to a lower birth rate during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. There will be a 10% decline in high school graduates nationally from 2025 to 2037, Board of Regents Executive Director Nathan Lukkes told lawmakers last year.
Despite the flat trend overall, more South Dakota high school graduates are pursuing higher education in the state than in recent years, Lukkes said in a news release. South Dakota student enrollment increased this fall to 22,410, a 1% increase over last year, according to system data.
State university enrollment grows by 5% as ‘2025 cliff’ looms

Black Hills State University reported the largest increase in student enrollment this fall by percentage and raw numbers, with 79 more students. It also reported its largest freshman class since 2019 at 500 enrollees, and a 58% increase in Native American enrollment, at 142 students.
South Dakota State University reported the highest percentage increase in full-time enrollment. Dakota State University’s enrollment is a record high for that school, and Northern State University’s enrollment is the highest since at least 1998.
Despite the decline in enrollment at USD, the university reported enrollment at its Sioux Falls campus increased by 19.1%. The university expanded degree programs to the campus in recent years, including its masters in business administration program and a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. The university recently announced that it will move its medical school to Sioux Falls.

The Turning Point USA founder was speaking at an outdoor event with over 3,000 people in attendance when he was shot at Utah Valley University, according to the Utah News Dispatch. Authorities have not arrested Kirk’s shooter as of Thursday evening.
Kirk, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump known for traveling the country and holding debates, has been credited with mobilizing young GOP voters and bringing a more populist conservative movement into the mainstream. His death sparked bipartisan rebukes against political violence nationwide.
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

The attack came at a time of heightened attention to political violence in the United States Then-Republican nominee Trump survived an assassination attempt last summer, with a bullet grazing his ear, while he was campaigning in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were the victims of arson when the Governor’s Mansion was set aflame while they were asleep. And most recently, former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman was assassinated in her home, while another state senator was gravely wounded in a related attack the same night.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote after Kirk’s death was announced that “America witnessed a cowardly act of evil,” and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton wrote that the act of violence was “heartbreaking.” Sanders said the U.S. was better off because of Kirk, 31.
Many officials characterized the shooting as an assassination, and offered their prayers for Kirk’s wife and children.
“The senseless and evil assassination of Charlie Kirk casts a sad and painful shadow over America tonight,” wrote Attorney General Tim Griffin. “My prayers are with Charlie’s beautiful family — his wife and his two young children — all those who were close to him and our Nation.”
Arkansas Speaker of the House Rep. Brian Evans of Cabot also offered prayers for Kirk’s family — and the university students who witnessed the shooting.

I’m deeply saddened and appalled by the news of Charlie Kirk’s passing and heartbroken by the violence today. My prayers are with his family and with the students who witnessed this horrific attack.
— Brian S. Evans (@AR_HouseSpeaker) September 10, 2025

The chair of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, retired Col. Marcus Jones, released a statement expressing hope that the shooter would be caught quickly.
“Political violence is reprehensible and wrong. Every American should be able to state their opinion — no matter what that opinion is — without facing violence,” Jones wrote. “Even and especially when we disagree with someone, we must all defend their right to use their voice.”
Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, referenced the shooting during a prayer she led at Thursday’s Legislative Joint Auditing-Counties and Municipalities hearing, saying the nation was in a “time of turmoil.” She asked God to “help us turn down the rhetoric and help us resolve to listen to others.”
“As each person, no matter the political spectrum, their ideology, their side of an issue, they have a right in our country and a sacred right to be able to speak their words and to express their views,” she said.
Rep David Ray, R-Maumelle, wrote on the social media platform X that the incident was “deeply disturbing and horrific.”
“There’s never an excuse for political violence, regardless of where it comes from. That’s why we have laws, rules, & a constitution: to settle our differences without banana Republic-type atrocities. God help us,” Ray wrote.
Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, wrote Kirk’s death pained him deeply, and that he had been “such a gift to this generation.”
“We don’t kill people because we disagree with them. Charlie was one of the last bastions of civil discourse, and they killed him for it,” Rose wrote in a separate post.

Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, had sharper words, using the moment to call for “Commonsense, bipartisan actions to reduce gun violence.”
“We just need elected officials with the courage and compassion to act,” Leding wrote. “No number of gun deaths is ‘worth’ the reality we’ve created. We all deserve to live free of violence.

We don’t have to live like this. Commonsense, bipartisan actions to reduce gun violence are right there. We just need elected officials with the courage and compassion to act.

The Turning Point USA founder charted the course for several of Wyoming’s most powerful political leaders. 
The post Charlie Kirk influenced Wyoming politics. A local GOP megadonor helped launch his career. appeared first on WyoFile .","When Charlie Kirk was a teenager, he had a chance encounter with Foster Friess, the late Wyoming businessman and Republican megadonor. 
They met in Tampa, Florida, at the 2012 Republican National Convention. Months before, Kirk had formed a new organization to recruit and organize young conservatives on college campuses, naming it Turning Point USA. 
In Tampa, Kirk spotted a man in a cowboy hat at the convention and recognized him as Friess, the New York Times reported earlier this year. 
“I ran into him in a stairwell,” Kirk posted on X in November. “A literal elevator pitch when I was 19.” 
The pitch worked. After the encounter, Friess wrote Kirk’s organization its first $10,000 check. 
Before Friess’ death in 2021, the two men and their families developed a friendship that would help launch Kirk’s career into the conservative stratosphere. At 31, Kirk was among the most influential young Republicans in the United States.
“Foster knew then that Charlie would move the culture and change history… and he did!” Lynn Friess, Foster’s widow, said in a statement posted on X. 
“He’s gone to be with the Lord. We are devastated by this news,” she wrote. 
Charlie Kirk, Lynn Friess and Foster Friess are pictured together. (@fosterfriess/X) 
By the time Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, he had built one of the most high-profile conservative brands in the country, amassed a social media following in the millions and become a trusted ally to President Donald Trump. 
He’d also helped to set the course for several of Wyoming’s most powerful political leaders. 
“I’ve known Charlie since before his rise to prominence — a salt-of-the-earth man with a beautiful family, driven by an unwavering commitment to his beliefs,” Wyoming Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, said in a statement. 
“My heart aches for his loved ones, his wife and two beautiful children, and my prayers are with them during this unimaginable loss,” Biteman wrote. “This act of political violence is a wound to our nation, and we must stand united against such hatred. Let us honor Charlie’s memory by fostering respectful dialogue over division, and peace over violence.”
Other Wyoming officials echoed Biteman in their own statements, including Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman. 
Additionally, the Wyoming Republican Party called for civil discourse and the Wyoming Democratic Party denounced political violence. 
“In the midst of this tragedy, it is important that we reaffirm the right of all to express their views freely, especially on college campuses, as Mr. Kirk did recently at UW,” University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel said in a statement. 
In April, Kirk spoke on campus after UW’s Turning Point USA student chapter invited him. The event sold out, and Kirk spent the majority of his time on stage debating students, according to The Laramie Reporter. And despite concerns that Kirk’s visit could grow unruly — as Wyoming U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman’s town hall in Laramie did the month prior — no such disruptions occurred.

It was Kirk’s first time speaking on UW’s campus, but not his first visit to Wyoming. 
In 2020, he addressed Republicans at their convention in Gillette, warning them the state could soon be run by Democrats if conservatives didn’t go on the offensive. 
That same year, Kirk got involved in Teton County’s local elections via attack ads, which were unusual for the community at the time. The three candidates endorsed in the mailers also condemned them. 
In 2023, he visited Teton County for the local GOP’s annual fundraiser. A few months later, Kirk weighed in on one of Wyoming’s more high-profile court cases in recent memory. 
After a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against a UW sorority for admitting a transgender woman, Kirk said the student should be imprisoned and he encouraged members of Kappa Kappa Gamma to harass her. 
“These girls should bully this freak,” he said on the Aug. 29, 2023 episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, a popular podcast. 
Not far from the sorority house, a group of about 100 students gathered on campus Wednesday evening to mourn Kirk. They stood together and prayed, some crying, others embracing one another. 
“I met [Kirk] like three years ago, and I was really struggling running this thing because people just didn’t like Turning Point all that much,” Gabe Saint, president of the organization’s UW chapter, told WyoFile at the vigil. 
“And now we’re way more popular, and it’s because of a lot of the stuff Charlie’s done, and how he’s supported us,” Saint said. 
Last December, Saint was awarded Turning Point USA’s student patriot of the year award in Phoenix.

“Spotting an inactive TP USA chapter on campus, [Saint] single-handedly revived it, transforming a four-member club into a powerhouse organization, hosting record-breaking events and reshaping university policy,” Kirk said at the awards event. 
Kirk credited Saint’s leadership with influencing the Wyoming Legislature’s decision to defund diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the university. 
“The sad thing is, like, Charlie, was he hardcore in a lot of his beliefs? Absolutely,” Saint told WyoFile. “But he did it the democratic way by having discourse. And he was shot for doing it the democratic way.” 
While Saint may be responsible for Turning Point’s growing popularity on UW’s campus, it was another student who started the chapter in 2017. 
“At the time, I did not realize how much starting that chapter would shape the rest of my life,” Jessie Rubino said in a statement sent to WyoFile. 
As the Wyoming state director for the State Freedom Caucus Network, it’s Rubino’s job to read and analyze legislation to then guide Wyoming Freedom Caucus members on how they should vote. In 2024, the group won control of the House — the first time a state freedom caucus controlled a legislative chamber in the U.S. 
That work and so much of Rubino’s life “can be traced back to the small group of conservatives who met Thursday nights in the student union in Laramie — all thanks to Charlie,” she wrote. 
She met her closest friends and the man who would become her husband, Joe, “through campus activism (and the Lord’s good hand),” she wrote. Joe Rubino is now a top official in the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office.
“I became connected with the most amazing patriots in Wyoming and across the nation. There are thousands of other people just like me who have been blessed by Charlie’s work,” Jessie Rubino wrote. “I am sickened and saddened, but assured that Charlie is in paradise with the Lord today.”

University Chancellor Glenn Boyce released an official statement on the university’s social media pages Thursday stating that an unnamed employee was terminated after Kirk was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking on the Utah Valley University campus. 
“The comments run completely counter to our institutional values of civility, fairness and respecting the dignity of each person,” the statement said. “We condemn these actions and this staff member is no longer employed by the university.” 
The university did not identify the employee in its statement. It’s just one instance among many Thursday where educators at schools across the country were criticized or fired for their comments about Kirk after his death. 
The employee referred to actions that “reimagined Klan members like Kirk” have taken, ending the post with, “So, no, I have no prayers to offer Kirk or respectable statements against violence.”
Mississippi State Auditor Shad White, a vocal critic of what he calls “woke” initiatives in higher education, shared a post on X that may have alluded to an employee at the university and what was re-shared on social media. 
“To Ole Miss, did an Ole Miss employee just repost this insane reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder? Answer,” White wrote. 

The attached photos to White’s post names Lauren Stokes, executive assistant to the vice chancellor of development at the university. She also has been publicly identified in other media. Stokes could not be reached for comment.
White’s post also shows the alleged reshared post that reads, ““For decades, yt [white] supremacist and reimagined Klan members like Kirk have wreaked havoc on our communities, condemning children and the populace at large to mass death for the sake of keeping their automatic guns.”
Neither university officials nor White’s office responded to Mississippi Today’s request for comment. 
Kirk was scheduled to appear at Ole Miss on Oct. 29, part of his “The American Comeback tour,” sponsored by his organization. 
It’s another high profile instance where White has used his platform to call out university employees and higher education leaders in the state for their beliefs he says are antithetical to conservative policy. 
In 2020, he pushed for a University of Mississippi professor to be fired after he stopped going to work for two weeks to protest racial inequality. More recently, he’s criticized Tommy Duff, former IHL board member, for his involvement in IHL policies surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion and other topics.  Both are considering a run for governor.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/06180031/OleMiss1-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-11 18:57:21.278544

The state transportation agency has proposed making up a $7.5 million gap in its current budget with cuts to construction projects and “position management savings.”

The Vermont Agency of Transportation released a plan this week to cut $7.5 million from its 2026 fiscal year budget — including more than $2 million in “position management savings” — after state economists lowered revenue projections in July by the same amount.
On Wednesday, the agency sent what’s known as a rescission plan to two Vermont legislative committees tasked with overseeing state spending when lawmakers aren’t in session. Those are the Joint Transportation Oversight Committee and the Joint Fiscal Committee. The latter must approve the agency’s plan before it goes into effect.
The committees are scheduled to meet Sept. 17 and 18, respectively, during which they are set to discuss the plan and hold public hearings on it. The agency was obligated to come up with budget cuts after state economists, at a July meeting with top lawmakers, downgraded previous estimates for how much money the state could expect to bring in to support its transportation system.

At that meeting, economists pointed to lower-than-expected recent revenue from taxes on motor vehicle purchases and from fees collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Over the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June, those receipts saw a sharp drop-off from the state’s initial projections. In the first month of the current fiscal year, this past July, tax revenue from vehicle purchases again underperformed against economists’ expectations, according to the latest state data.
Meanwhile, the state has long faced a decline in gasoline tax revenue as cars have become more fuel-efficient, and as more people purchase electric vehicles. Lawmakers added a new annual fee on electric vehicles last year aimed at curbing some of the impact.
On Wednesday, the transportation agency listed about a dozen line items from its 2026 budget it is looking to cut. 
The largest, according to the list, is $2,254,000 in projected “position management savings,” though the agency did not elaborate. Another $2 million would be saved by delaying a garage project in Springfield, while reductions in tree trimming, mowing and culvert maintenance would together save $915,000, the list states. 
Delaying a rail platform project in Rutland would save another $500,000, while another $230,000 in savings would come from suspending agency employees’ travel and participation in conferences, the list states.
Joe Flynn, the state’s transportation secretary, declined to provide more detail about the plan before it is presented to lawmakers, he said through a spokesperson Thursday.
One of the legislators who will weigh in on the plan next week is Rep. Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House Transportation Committee. Walker said Thursday the fact that budget cuts are on the table highlights a need for major changes to how the state’s transportation system is paid for.
He said he does not like the idea of cutting any costs lawmakers have already deemed important enough to budget for, such as maintenance to keep roads safe. With transportation revenues failing to keep pace with expenses, lawmakers need to have serious conversations about new ways to pay for key infrastructure, Walker said.
This year, for instance, legislators agreed to halt an annual transfer of about $20 million from the state’s transportation coffers to its general fund for use by the Vermont State Police. But that’s not going to be enough, he warned.
“We’re going to have to close this gap, and all things need to be on the table to do that,” Walker said.

The Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park has long offered a true wilderness experience, with its undeveloped shorelines and remote campsites reachable only by paddling. But after years of back and forth between state officials and the owners of the dam that creates the reservoir, the future of this site still looks uncertain.
Before the state could consider acquiring the facility, it needed a comprehensive picture of the conditions of the Green River Dam and dike and the operational and maintenance costs. A long-awaited study commissioned by lawmakers provided those answers when it was released two weeks ago.
The hydro facility was built in 1947, which raised concerns about whether it would need expensive structural updates. The report finds that the hydro facility is largely safe and performs well and provides estimates for the initial project costs and annual maintenance costs. 
But Gov. Phil Scott made clear last week during a press conference that the state doesn’t have the resources to take over the dam.
The Green River Reservoir’s dam is owned and operated by Morrisville Water & Light, but the utility has been seeking a new owner for the dam, saying they can no longer make a profit operating the facility. The utility argues the state should take it because the state benefits when people visit the Green River Reservoir State Park.
In 2010, Morrisville Water & Light started the process of relicensing the dam with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a step required every few decades. During that process, the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources issued new water quality regulations, which establish how the facility can be operated to align with the federal Clean Water Act.
Morrisville Water & Light claimed that operating the facility under the new permit would limit their power generation capabilities, as the water level in the reservoir would need to be roughly stable, impacting the utility’s ability to do drawdowns and resulting in financial loss. After years of litigation, a Vermont Supreme Court decision ultimately determined the regulations were necessary to meet Vermont water quality standards.

Scott Johnstone, general manager of Morrisville Water & Light, said the utility would no longer be able to operate the hydro facility if it’s not producing revenue through power generation, and it has been exploring options to sell the facility, but no other company has been interested in buying it, for the same reason.
The recent legislative report also states that generating power at the facility with the new water quality permit would result in financial loss.
However, Jon Groveman, policy and water program director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, took issue with that finding. “There’s no analysis that I was able to see,” he said. “Maybe that’s accurate, maybe it’s not.” 
“But even if that is correct,” Groveman added, “it doesn’t change what’s needed to meet the minimum water quality standards.” Groveman emphasized the importance of these standards in maintaining healthy waters and fish habitats.
Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, said some hydropower facilities have experienced a reduction in maximum power production, but not to the extent that they wouldn’t be able to generate power without a financial loss. “This is the only instance my staff are aware of where our regulatory framework produced a result that effectively would not allow power generation to continue, at least not cost effectively,” she said.
But Johnstone said there are two reasons the Green River Dam situation may differ from the others. “The Green River Dam was built to fluctuate and draw down water as all reservoir-based dams do, and essentially the state is no longer supportive of that sort of flow regime even where there’s a reservoir,” he said.
Johnstone added that there are a few other dams in the state that rely on drawdowns from reservoirs, but most of them have bigger rivers flowing into them, whereas the Green River Dam relies mostly on the reservoir because it doesn’t have a significant daily flow.
Secondly, the relicensing process may occur at different times for different facilities, and according to Johnstone, the regulations become stricter as the years pass, and some facilities could have different permits.
According to the study, the most cost-effective option would be to maintain the dam and dike to preserve the reservoir but decommission the hydroelectric facility and cease producing power. In that scenario, the report estimates, the reservoir would generate $32.7 million in visitor spending and $1.5 million in state sales tax revenue over the next 20 years. 
Yet Moore highlighted that the facility is particularly complex to operate, so taking ownership of it would be a significant obligation for the state. “We already are responsible for 100 dams; many of which have costly maintenance needs that we are struggling to keep up with,” she said.
Gov. Scott said during last week’s press conference that he was willing to collaborate with the parties involved to find a solution. But what that solution could look like is still unclear.
“We’re not fighting about the permit anymore. We’ve kind of given up on that,” Johnstone said. Morrisville Water & Light is still following the old regulations, but when federal regulators issue a new license, the utility will have to comply with the new water quality permit.
In the meantime, the utility has started the process to receive federal approval to stop producing power at the Green River Dam.
“We’re going to take care of the facility during this, what we hope is a transition period, but our view is that if we are not going to generate power at that facility anymore, then the use of the dam that is left is to support the state park,” Johnstone said. “So our position is that the state of Vermont should now own that dam because it supports that state park.”
The process of transition could take years, so nothing is expected to change at the Green River Reservoir in the immediate future, but now that the legislative report has been released, the ownership of the dam is likely to become a topic of discussion in the next legislative session.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn a January 2024 proposed rule that would have reduced the discharge of nutrients and pollutants from meat packing plants and slaughterhouses. 
The agency said it chose to withdraw the rules in an effort to prioritize the nation’s food supply and to keep food prices down. 
The proposed rules would have revised effluent limitations guidelines and standards, or ELG,s for the meat and poultry products industry. This industry, which the agency refers to as MPP, includes facilities that slaughter, dress and pack meat and poultry products for human or animal consumption. 
According to EPA, the meat and poultry product industry produces wastewater polluted with nitrogen, phosphorus, oil and grease, biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and chlorides. 
The EPA’s proposed rule from January 2024 said the more stringent effluent limitations would “improve water quality and protect human health and the environment.” EPA said the regulatory guidelines would cost about $232 million annually in social costs and could reduce pollutant discharges by 100 million pounds per year.

EPA said in its withdrawal statement, published in the Federal Register: 
“In the EPA’s judgment, it is not appropriate to impose additional regulation on the MPP industry, given Administration priorities and policy concerns, including protecting food supply and mitigating inflationary prices for American consumers following a protracted period of high inflation from 2020 through 2024.”
Additionally, the withdrawal decision said EPA’s evaluation of the proposed rules showed it would have caused increased air pollution and solid waste that would “negatively impact the environment and public health.”
The shift also reflects, according to the rationale, the agency’s focus on nitrogen and phosphorus from non-point source polluters, rather than point-source polluters. Non-point source pollution – or pollution that cannot be traced to a singular source – makes up the majority of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution that enters U.S. waterways. 
In line with Trump administration
In its rationale for withdrawing the proposed rule, which was published Sept. 3, 2025, EPA said it only has to revise the ELG guidelines “if appropriate” and has “broad discretion” to consider the priorities and policies of the current administration in its decisions.
“At the core of the EPA’s decision is the understanding that the MPP industry plays a critical role in the nation’s food supply chain, and meat and poultry processors have faced an unprecedented disruption in operations and costs in recent years as a result of several factors, including COVID-19 food supply and supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the unprecedented outbreak of avian flu and New World Screwworm,” the rationale said. 
The rationale said more stringent ELGs on the meat and poultry products industry would lead to “further diversion of the industry’s resources at a critical time.” EPA explained additional limits could cause plants to close or to divert from their a goals of increasing food production and availability. 
The rationale sites several executive orders from President Donald Trump, and recent actions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that show the administration’s priorities for the industry. Closures in the industry, EPA said, could lead to meat shortages and food price increases similar to those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The EPA proposed rules would have regulated water pollution from slaughterhouses and meat packing plants with tools like screening, anaerobic treatments, chemical additions, ultraviolet lights, denitrification, hauling and more. 
In its rationale for withdrawal, EPA said these methods would increase energy demand and therefore lead to increased ozone and fine particulate matter air pollution. 
EPA said the regulatory options would also lead to an estimated 2.5 billion to 8.5 billion-pound increase in solid waste, like animal blood, fluids and excrements, that would have to be sent to landfills or applied to cropland. 
Analysis included in the proposed rules found that the market effect from the additional pollution regulation would be “sufficiently small” and “unlikely to have a noticeable effect on producer or consumer behavior.” It also said the regulatory options would result in a “negligible increase” in required energy generation. 
The proposed rules’ analysis of the regulatory options said it would not “significantly increase” the amount of wastewater treatment sludge generated by the facilities. Estimates in the rules ranged from around 380,000 to 1.2 million pounds of “sludge” annually.
Environmental groups say EPA made the ‘wrong move’ 
In its proposed rules, which were filed under the Biden administration, EPA’s gathered data found that the meat and poultry product industry “discharges the highest phosphorus levels and second highest nitrogen levels of all industrial categories” or point source pollution.
The nutrients, and other pollutants EPA identified as common in the industry, can impact stream health and biodiversity, impact human health and increase drinking water treatment costs. Health risks associated with consuming water high in these pollutants, according to EPA, include infant methemoglobinemia, or blue baby syndrome, colorectal cancer, thyroid disease, neural tube defects and gastrointestinal illness. 
In its environmental impact analysis EPA estimated around 75% of all stream segments below direct and indirect wastewater outfalls from MPP facilities are impaired for at least one pollutant found in MPP wastewater. 
The more stringent guidelines, the proposed rules said, would improve human health outcomes, stream ecology and recreation, drinking water treatment costs and fishing yields, among other things.
The proposed rules were submitted in early 2024 and received thousands of public comments through March 2024, before the current EPA’s decision to withdraw the proposed rules.
Molly Armus, a program manager with the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said EPA’s decision was “a direct contradiction” to the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again directive. 
“For decades, slaughterhouses have dumped toxic waste into our rivers, leaving rural communities to pick up the tab,” Armus said in a statement. “By allowing this pollution to continue unchecked, Trump is once again putting industry profits over clean water and public health.”
Locally, Michael Schmidt, the general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council, said slaughterhouses and packing plants are some of the largest dischargers of nitrate in Iowa. 
Schmidt said even when the industry is regulated, “they don’t always comply with their limits” and referenced a recent settlement from the Iowa Attorney General against a meat packing plant in northeast Iowa that violated its pollution guidelines several times. 
“Rolling back EPA regulations to outdated standards from decades ago is the wrong move,” Schmidt said. “It benefits the near-monopoly international corporations controlling the meat industry, not everyday people. It will not make our water cleaner or Iowans healthier.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA —  Data centers and large manufacturing facilities can pull hundreds of megawatts of electricity from the utility grid. A case in front of Kansas utility regulators has created a new way to ensure costs created by those businesses are fairly distributed among consumers and investors. 
On Oct. 8, the Kansas Corporation Commission will consider a unanimous settlement agreement created after multiple consumer, nonprofit and private interest parties worked to reach agreement on a large load service rate plan and utility tariff. 
A utility tariff sets up a rate structure and terms and conditions of utility services. 
The unanimous agreement designs a rate structure for large-load customers, defined in the agreement as those that reach a peak load of 75 megawatts monthly. 
To put that in perspective, Topeka and Lawrence together probably use about 75 megawatts of electricity per month, said Chuck Caisley, Evergy executive vice president of public affairs. 
Parties involved in the settlement negotiations included KCC staff, Evergy, the Data Center Coalition, the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, school districts, Google LLC, the Sierra Club, multiple industrial businesses and the National Resources Defense Council.
“It’s really going to be, I think, a model for the rest of the United States when it’s all said and done,” Caisley said. “It’s unprecedented when you go into a regulatory proceeding like this on such a complicated issue for all the parties to ultimately walk out and say, ‘This would be fair for everybody.’”
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel at the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, was part of the negotiations on behalf of small businesses and residential consumers. 
“There’s definitely a lot of compromise here,” Astrab said. “This is a unique document. Normally, we file some initial testimony, respond to the application, kind of setting off positions and preferences. But in this docket, we went straight into technical discussions and planning and more of a collaborative approach with utilities, data center customers and other stakeholders in Kansas, to figure out what’s a good tariff.”
 
Equity between customers
The rise of data centers has pushed forward national policy conversations about large-load users, with the intent often to make sure costs aren’t shifted to other customers or that their significant electricity needs don’t destabilize the grid. The conversations can be at odds with the desire to create a welcoming economic development environment.
The U.S. Department of Energy in January issued a policy statement  about mitigation of financial risks should a large user close, leaving an underutilized utility system, and mitigating resource risks if electricity demand would exceed supply, among other issues. 
Kansas’ proposed tariff addresses multiple factors, including costs large utility users will bear if they terminate their contract early and other safety nets, Caisley said. 
Large-load users will sign a 17-year contract outlining their maximum load projections, he said. Even if the company reduces its electrical demands to 50% or 75% of their projections, the company will be required to pay 80% of that projection, Caisley said.
“There’s no other rate in our system today, not even for giant manufacturers, not for oil refineries, not for the Ford plant, not for the Mars plant – they don’t have a requirement like that,” Caisley said. 
A significant amount of collateral is also required to be posted, he said, amounting to two years of minimum bills, which could run to millions of dollars. 
Astrab said discussions about rate design captured the “unique notion” that capital investments would not have been made until a later date if a large-load customer hadn’t been coming onto the grid at a specific point.
 
‘Novel’ element
A third part of the proposed tariff is what Caisley called the “most novel” and an approach that makes the Kansas plan stand out. An interim capacity charge will be in place on top of the regular electrical rate to pay for additional electricity generation that’s required to meet the new demand, he said. It acknowledges that Evergy may need to invest in expansion plans earlier than expected, which comes with a cost.
“As far as I know, that’s one of the first places in the United States that has that, and so these rates will actually be higher than existing industrial consumer rates, but the data centers acknowledge that it’s an issue of equity and fairness,” Caisley said. “From our perspective, if these data centers cause significant rate increases to existing customers, that’s not ultimately good for the state. It’s not ultimately good for economic development.”
 
Open for business
In strategizing about potential rates, making sure Kansas stayed competitive in drawing companies to locate here was important, Astrab and Caisley said. 
“We think that this will protect existing consumers while enabling economic development in Kansas,” Caisley said. “We’ve been calling it the Goldilocks solution. It’s just right.”
Astrab said Kansas policymakers and the governor’s office have made economic development and attracting large business customers a priority. 
“With that context in mind, we don’t want to be in the way of developing Kansas’ economies and communities and bringing new businesses to the area,” he said. “We definitely want to make sure that if we do something, it’s not going to be so strict or cost-prohibitive for business that they’ll say, ‘No, we can’t come to Kansas.’”
Caisley said he believes Kansas is leading the way. 
“Anytime in today’s society and in the environment that any company or town or regulatory entity operates in today, where you can get everybody with such diverse perspectives and interests around a table and stack hands on something, that means you must have done something right,” he said. 
KCC’s three-member commission, which is required to approve the settlement, will hold a one-day hearing about the agreement at 9 a.m. on Oct. 8.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KCC-commission-2-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-09-11 18:57:21.278544

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)  For three days in August, a Rhode Island affordable housing developer had to sit on the good news that it had been awarded a $7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) before U.S. Sen. Jack Reed’s office could issue a news release.
But the federal agency never notified the Women’s Development Corporation (WDC) that it had even won a grant for a project to build 14 units for individuals escaping domestic violence in five new buildings in Providence’s West End. Nor did HUD execute a grant agreement with the Providence-based nonprofit. 
Instead, on Sept. 5, HUD issued a new notice of funding to supersede the funding opportunity WDC applied to in May, effectively canceling $75 million in Continuum of Care Build Program grants already announced by Congress. The new funding opportunity, which included significant changes to eligibility criteria, set an application deadline of 3 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 12.
A one-week turnaround is unrealistic given the extensive revisions to eligibility requirements that require applicants to support the partisan agenda of the Trump administration, say WDC and the National Alliance to End Homelessness in a lawsuit against HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The two plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, National Homelessness Law Center, Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and the ACLU of Rhode Island. They claim that HUD’s new eligibility policy is unconstitutional and unlawful because applicants are prohibited from being so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” for immigrants, providing “harm reduction” services for drug users and having inclusive policies for transgender people.
The case, National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al., asks the court to block HUD’s unlawful funding restrictions and restore fair access to federal housing funds for providers nationwide. The lawsuit claims projects in 36 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are now ineligible for Continuum of Care Build grants under the Trump administration’s criteria.
“The new notice categorically disqualifies from consideration any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the Administration disfavors,” the lawsuit states. “And, even in jurisdictions with policies the Administration deems acceptable, entities effectively cannot compete for funding unless they profess agreement with the Administration’s view that sex is binary and immutable and foreswear operating safe injection sites or similar programs designed to reduce the harm from drug use—even with wholly non-federal funds.”
The lawsuit lists the following 36 states where housing development projects would be disqualified under the new grant eligibility criteria: Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Georgia; Hawaii; Idaho; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Maine; Massachusetts; Minnesota; Montana; Nebraska; Nevada; v. New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Texas; Utah; Vermont; Washington; West Virginia; and Wisconsin. 
WDC Executive Director Frank Shea said that attaching political strings to competitive funding programs prevents the organization from providing critical services to the community. WDC has no control over whether the state or the city of Providence is or is not considered a sanctuary or allows a safe injection site.
“This is almost like redlining where entire communities aren’t eligible to apply for federal grants that are congressionally authorized programs using our tax money,” Shea said. “None of it is related to whether the housing is good or we’re using the resources appropriately. It’s just random things.”
WDC’s 14-unit project was part of a larger development to preserve 47 family units across 19 historic buildings, including some for families experiencing homelessness. WDC was working with the Rhode Island Continuum of Care and Sojourner House on the project.
Chip Unruh, a spokesperson for Reed’s office, said the senator is working with his colleagues in Congress “to reverse HUD’s unjust decision and ensure HUD’s Inspector General thoroughly investigates.”
“WDC applied for this competitive grant, they earned it, and clearly deserve it,” Unruh said in an email. “But instead of awarding the funds as Congress intended, Trump officials at HUD decided to rewrite this program – for the second time this year – and change it from a grant that does the hard work of reducing homelessness to an extremist program that ignores what actually works. HUD’s job is to reduce homelessness and expand housing opportunities, not make it harder to do those things.”
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said Thursday afternoon he was still awaiting word on whether a hearing would be scheduled Friday on the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order.
“The new conditions that have been imposed are completely irrelevant to what the grant is about … and designed to simply promote a partisan and ideological agenda of the Trump administration,” Brown said.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Mary S. McElroy.
A HUD spokesperson had not responded to a request for comment as of 6 p.m. Thursday.

In a video message posted on X Wednesday night, Sheriff Ivey, a longtime advocate for the Legislature to pass an open-carry law, said that he had informed his deputies of the policy shift. The statute at issue (790.053) makes it “unlawful for any person to openly carry on or about his or her person any firearm or electric weapon or device.”
“While the opinion at this point is not yet final as the court allows for time for the filing of a motion for rehearing or reconsideration, there’s no reason to expect that the court will reverse its decision,” Ivey said.
He’s not the only sheriff making that move.
The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office, and the Pensacola Police Department will no longer enforce the state’s open carry law either, according to the Pensacola News Journal.
The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office announced on Wednesday that it has informed officers that they cannot detain or arrest solely based on openly carrying a firearm.
The ruling isn’t final until the 15-day window for a rehearing has run out, but the state likely won’t appeal the decision. Ron DeSantis advocated as recently as Monday for the Legislature to change the ban on open carry, and Attorney General James Uthmeier’s said on Wednesday that the court’s ruling was “a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians.”
The ruling is only applicable to the First District, which encompasses most of the counties in North Florida. Brevard County is not within that jurisdiction.
Ivey said he had consulted with Wayne Scheiner, the state attorney in Florida’s 18th Judicial Circuit, as well as the attorney representing the Florida Sheriffs Association. He said he had informed all of the police departments in the county that they no longer needed to enforce the ban.
A spokesperson for the police department in Palm Bay, the largest city in Brevard County, confirmed that it is following suit. “At the direction of the State Attorneys’s Office and Florida Police Chiefs Association, we will not be enforcing that statute as it pertains to open carry,” said Lt. Virginia Kilmer.
Not all law enforcement agencies are dropping enforcement — at least not yet.
“We have not changed our policy,” said Cpl. Jamie Miller with the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department.
“We have not issued a change in policy yet on this matter but it is anticipated soon,” said Javonni Hampton with the Leon County Sheriff’s Department.
Several other sheriffs departments did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Florida Sheriffs Association, nor the attorney general’s office.
In its ruling, the First District noted that the Florida Supreme Court had upheld the ban on open carry in its 2017 ruling of Norman v. State. However, Judge Stephanie Ray wrote that the court felt bound instead to apply a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case called New York State Rifle & Association v. Bruen, which struck down New York’s concealed carry restrictions.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha has been an outspoken critic of Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to repurpose the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention center, which he announced Aug. 19. The planned prison conversion in this rural community of about 7,200 residents came at the State of Nebraska’s request in response to the Trump administration’s deportation push.

Upon her arrival Wednesday, Juarez was provided a guided tour, which the Examiner was not allowed to join. Afterward, she said she was impressed with the grounds and the prison property’s current use: preparing low-risk inmates with programming to ease their reentry into society.
However, she shared concerns. Among them: worries about crowded conditions — both for a future migrant population and for the broader state prison system that will likely absorb the 186 Nebraska inmates being relocated to other prison facilities from a rehabilitative setting in southwest Nebraska.
“There is no way that I believe 300 people could be housed in that McCook facility,” she said, noting that an area of the prison currently used for teaching appeared to be one of the likeliest spaces for expanding bed space. “I can just see them squeezing these double bunk beds into these rooms.”
 Midwest hub for ICE

Pillen has said up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation are to be housed in the repurposed center, which the state will run in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The governor has said he envisions the facility as a Midwestern hub for ICE. 
As of Thursday, the Work Ethic Camp had 155 of its 186 state inmates left to relocate. State senators have said the McCook facility, which opened in 2001, was originally designed for 100.
On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said the state anticipates that the McCook facility will begin housing its new population of migrant federal detainees in October.
After talking with current Work Ethic Camp inmates about their circumstances, Juarez said she wants the state to consider early release rather than relocation for incarcerated people within a year of completing their criminal sentences. 
“To me this circumstance is so unique,” Juarez said. “I’m advocating for as many people to be released as possible. If there are men there that are ready to be let go, I think they should be able to go home.”

Juarez discussed her interaction with one McCook inmate, who told her he had six months until his scheduled release and had earned a spot helping in the prison’s kitchen, where he said he was picking up cooking skills. He told her he was anxious that he could be transferred to a facility with fewer privileges. 
Said Juarez: “What kind of setback are these guys going to be enduring when they get moved?”
A prison system spokesperson, in response, said the department does not have the authority to release individuals early.  (That’s up to the Parole Board.) 
Spokesperson Dayne Urbanovsky said all Correctional Services facilities have a “robust offering” of rehabilitative services.
“As much as possible, NDCS will work to ensure individuals who have started programs at WEC can finish those at other facilities,” she said in a written response.
Furthermore, Correctional Services is partnering with an engineering firm to “safely repurpose (McCook’s) multi-purpose spaces to accommodate additional beds,” Urbanovsky said.
 Closed-door briefing

Juarez is not the only state senator to have recently visited the McCook facility. Two members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, State Sens. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, stopped in earlier this month.
A day after their visit, the Judiciary Committee held a closed-door meeting with certain state officials. The briefing about the conversion plan was organized by Pillen’s Office and Bosn.
DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, did not sign a letter from 13 progressive state senators , including Juarez, requesting a public hearing about the McCook project before the Judiciary Committee.
Unanswered questions remain about Nebraska-ICE jail after private legislative briefing

After Bosn said the request for such a meeting was premature, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who also signed the letter, announced that the legislative committee he chairs, the Urban Affairs Committee, would hold a public hearing Friday for people to air opinions. That meeting begins at 9 a.m. in room 1507 of the State Capitol. 
The Urban Affairs Committee oversees building codes issues, and McKinney said he is concerned about overcrowding.  
Juarez, a Democrat in her first year as a state lawmaker for South Omaha, said she’s felt frustrated and still wants more details about the McCook-ICE project. She said her visit to the facility better prepares her for future conversations.
“The only reason that I found out as much as I did was because I physically went down there,” she said.

Juarez said it was her understanding that state law, in addition to giving Nebraska state senators access to prisons without prior notice, allows lawmakers to take phones inside to take photographs and videos. She said she was asked to leave hers in a locker.
While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees. For example, she said Work Ethic Camp staff pointed out the current library book selection is written in English. 
Juarez said she could assist in gathering reading material in different languages. She said she also wants to know if the proposed ICE detention center would continue to offer, as do state prisons, mental and other health care services. 
 No signed agreement yet

State officials have acknowledged that many details about the facility have yet to be ironed out. As of Thursday, there still was no signed agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services for the detention center federal officials nicknamed “the Cornhusker Clink.”
Among lawmaker questions is whether the executive branch, Pillen’s administration, has authority to let the feds use the state prison facility. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental reformatory and penal institutions.”
Pillen, however, has cited an article in the Nebraska Constitution saying that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.” He also argues state statute gives him authority through its creation of the Department of Correctional Services.
What’s in a name? Fed moniker for Nebraska immigration jail draws ire and defense

From the start, Pillen has said he felt a responsibility to support the president’s immigration agenda and wanted Nebraska to do its “fair share.” He has said that he and other Republican governors have heard President Donald Trump’s call to “step up” — and that he was proud to also empower the state’s Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol to become a part of Trump’s mass deportation mission. 
Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature also have expressed support for the governor’s position on immigration.
A University of Nebraska-Lincoln law professor who studies the impact of detention said the project offers “spectacle, not safety or stability.” Danielle Jefferis, in an opinion piece Thursday in the Nebraska Examiner, said the Nebraska prison system has traditionally argued that “rehabilitation matters” but that the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds.
“That choice is not only about corrections policy,” she wrote. “It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.”
 Skeptical of future

In an interview with the Examiner Wednesday outside of the Work Ethic Camp, Juarez said she was less anxious about what might be ahead for ICE detainees after she saw the prison’s grounds, including an outdoor recreational courtyard.

“I felt a little more calm than I had anticipated once I was inside,” she said. 
But she said she was unclear and remained skeptical about how operations might change under an ICE contract and said her visit would be the first of more. Her underlying feeling, she said, is that migrants working in the U.S. without a criminal or violent past shouldn’t be held behind bars.
After her tour of the work camp, Juarez dropped off some “We are Friends of Immigrants” signs to local residents who had requested them from an Omaha group that has protested the ICE facility. Juarez told McCook residents that she planned to continue to monitor the changes.
“I’ll be coming back,” she said.

Emanuel Cleaver warned Missouri lawmakers Thursday that the effort to redraw the 5th District seat to favor Republicans will be long remembered by voters who resent being swapped by politicians seeking to increase their power.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, testifies Thursday against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver warned Missouri lawmakers Thursday that the effort to redraw the 5th District seat to favor Republicans will be long remembered by voters who resent being swapped by politicians seeking to increase their power.
Speaking to the Senate Local Government, Elections and Pensions Committee, Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat, noted that Texas has already revised district lines this year to favor Republicans and California will vote later this year on a plan that favors Democrats.
President Donald Trump is demanding the changes to help Republicans keep their slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Democrats are fighting back in the states they control.
“If we fight fire with fire long enough,” Cleaver said, “all we’ll have left is ashes.”
Cleaver’s warning went unheeded and the committee, on a 6-2 party-line vote a few hours later, sent the redistricting plan, which has already passed the Missouri House, to the Senate for debate. By the same vote, the committee also approved a proposal altering how majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
Both pieces of legislation will be debated Friday, with Republicans apparently ready to shut down debate as they did to push through rules changes on Wednesday.
During the hearing, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said he expects little or no debate on Friday.
“They’re going to shut us down,” Beck said. “They’re not going to let us speak on this, because it’s inconvenient.”
There was some grumbling about the process from one Republican, state Sen. Joe Nicola of Grain Valley, who said he has been told he can speak on the floor about the legislation but that no amendments will be accepted.
“When I don’t have my voice, the 185,000 people I represent also lose their voice, and that’s extremely irritating to me,” Nicola said. “I’ve seen many processes here, and even recently, the rules being broken. And it’s just a shame. It’s a real shame for this institution.”
Nicola voted for both pieces of legislation in the committee.
Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. Cleaver represents the 5th DIstrict, which includes most of Kansas City and Jackson County. The other Democrat, U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell, represents the 1st District in St. Louis.
Cleaver said he skipped votes in Washington to make the rare appearance for a member of Congress before a state legislative committee. 
“I chose to miss (Wednesday) votes, and I chose to miss the ones today, because I thought this was extremely important,” Cleaver said.
The 5th District, which he has represented since 2005, would be carved up, with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts while heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County, would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, speaks to reporters Thursday after testifying against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Cleaver said he is saddened by the bill and the need to explain how he works to represent all points of view and work with Missouri Republicans in Congress on the state’s behalf.
Polling, Cleaver said, shows voters oppose the redistricting plan. 
“This is immensely unpopular, so I was not just here representing myself,” Cleaver said. “I’m representing the people of this district.”
And, he said, he intends to seek re-election.
“A lot goes into making another decision,” Cleaver said. “But right now, I’m running.”
No one from the public spoke in favor of the bill. While state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel who sponsored the bill, was testifying, he was challenged by state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, on the origin of the new map.
Deaton said it was drawn in Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office before the special session was called. 
Nurrenbern said she did not believe it.
“I think it is a lot of BS what you guys keep doing, that you’re saying that this map was drawn in the state of Missouri,” Nurrenbern said. “We all know the truth, representative. We all know that this came straight from D.C.”
Deaton said he accepted Kehoe’s word that the bill was drafted in his office. 
“People in Washington, D.C., as I’ve observed them, are not shy,” Deaton said. “If they had a map, I assume they would have been willing to put it out there and say, ‘we think this is a wonderful map. We hope Missouri would adopt it.’”
Final passage on Friday won’t automatically put the maps into place for next year’s election. The bill will take effect 90 days after the special session ends, but plans are being made by labor unions and others to seek a referendum, which would delay implementation until a statewide vote.
And opponents promised the bill will be challenged in court. The Missouri Constitution directs lawmakers to draw new congressional district lines after every decennial census. The current map was passed in 2022 and the next census is in 2030.
Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition said she believes the constitution does not allow a new map to be imposed now.
“This map is also subject to a challenge under the Voting Rights Act for the dilution of African-American votes,” Lieberman said. 
Cleaver is Black and the line chosen for part of the district boundary, Troost Avenue, was the line separating Black and white sections of Kansas City when housing segregation was legal, Lieberman said.
“This is an unprecedented power grab here in Missouri,” she said.
 Initiative petition changes

The hearing on the changes to the initiative process brought some testy exchanges between Democrats and Republicans.
Currently, any proposal placed on a statewide ballot needs only a majority of votes to pass. That is the standard for constitutional amendments, statutory changes and proposals subject to a referendum.
The proposed changes, which would be on a ballot and subject to the current standard for passage, would only apply to constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petitions. Along with a statewide majority, those constitutional amendments would also need a majority vote in their favor in all eight congressional districts.
If one district opposed a ballot measure while the other seven passed it, as few as 5.3% of voters could control the outcome for the whole state.
“The main purpose is to protect the Constitution from changes that the majority of all the voters in Missouri, in every area of the state, don’t agree with,” said state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Republican from Moberly, as he presented the bill to the Senate committee.
As the committee was voting, Beck tried to make it subject to the same majority requirements it would impose on citizen initiative petitions.
“If this is such a great idea and we are going to change the constitution, and this is the best way to do it, why don’t we use that same standard for the legislature changing it as the initiative process,” Beck said.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, said Beck was being “too clever” and joined other Republicans in voting down the proposal.
“The whole point of this is to set those standards and to change those standards,” Brattin said, “but it has to be adopted by the current standard.”

Kevin Stitt on Thursday appointed three officials to his administration, all of whom he has previously named to other positions in Oklahoma state government. 
Stitt appointed Donelle Harder as Oklahoma Secretary of State, David Ostrowe as chief operating officer and Dustin Hilliary as his senior advisor. 
“We successfully launched this administration by bringing a fresh set of eyes from Oklahoma’s business community, and we will finish the same way,” Stitt said in a statement. “These three outstanding Oklahomans bring diverse strengths: Dustin’s trusted leadership and negotiation prowess, David’s operational acumen, and Donelle’s strategic vision.”
The appointments follow the resignations of Josh Cockroft, who serves as secretary of state and Stitt’s chief policy advisor, and Rick Rose, the head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and Oklahoma’s chief operating officer. Cockcroft’s resignation is effective Oct. 2 while Rose plans to depart Sept. 26.

Harder previously served as Stitt’s senior advisor and deputy Secretary of State and worked as his spokesperson and campaign manager. She also previously worked as former U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe’s spokesperson. 
In the private sector, she sold her regional public relations and marketing firm to Pinkston in 2022, and she became one of the company’s senior vice presidents. 
“I’m honored to serve as Secretary of State and support Governor Stitt’s administration again,” Harder said in a statement. “I look forward to sharpening our strategic approach and ensuring this administration remains effective and focused on delivering good government for the people of Oklahoma.”
Her appointment is effective Oct. 1. 
Ostrowe will return to Stitt’s administration as the chief operating officer and secretary to “drive cabinet coordination and support agency directors.”
David Ostrowe is pictured. (Provided by the Oklahoma Governor’s Office)
He currently serves as president and CEO of O&M Restaurant Group leading brand expansions across states. 
During Stitt’s first term, Ostrowe served as Oklahoma’s first Secretary of Digital Transformation and Administration. He was indicted by former Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter in late 2020 for allegedly bribing a state official. Ostrowe was accused of threatening to cut funding from the state Tax Commission if commissioners didn’t waive penalties and interests on a tax debt. 
Current Attorney General Gentner Drummond dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled, and apologized to Ostrowe on behalf of the state after he took office. He said Ostrowe should not have been indicted and did nothing wrong.
“In Governor Stitt’s first administration, we worked with passion to deliver digital transformation and make government more efficient and transparent,” Ostrowe said in a statement. “I am honored to return as COO to help finish that mission and continue advancing good government for all Oklahomans.”
Dustin Hilliary is pictured. (Provided by the Oklahoma Governor’s Office)
Hilliary, Stitt’s new senior advisor and chief negotiator, also serves as the vice chair of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. It was not immediately clear if he would continue serving in both roles. 
He is co-CEO of Hilliary Communications, which provides telephone and broadband service to customers in Oklahoma, Texas and Iowa. Hilliary is also co-publisher of the Hilliary Media Group, a media holding company, and operates a real estate development company.
“It is an honor to serve Oklahoma and to work alongside Governor Stitt in his final term to advance policies with the Legislature that put our state on a strong path today and for future generations,” Hilliary said in a statement.
The salaries of all three appointees were not immediately provided by the Governor’s Office.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)One day after announcing a deal with Japan’s largest electrical producer, the lead developer of the proposed trans-Alaska gas pipeline has revealed a second agreement, this time with POSCO International Corp. a South Korean steel manufacturer.
A spokesperson for Glenfarne, the firm advancing the pipeline project, declined to make the terms of the agreement available on Thursday.
Glenfarne released a statement saying that the agreement includes terms for POSCO to buy 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year from the pipeline, if built. 
“This agreement will include initial terms for POSCO to supply a significant portion of the steel required for Alaska LNG’s 807-mile, 42-inch pressurized natural gas pipeline,” the statement said.
Glenfarne owns 75% of AKLNG, as the proposed pipeline project is also known, which would transport liquified natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to the Kenai Peninsula for sale and export. The remaining 25% of the project is held by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. The two companies are pursuing the pipeline via a co-owned subsidiary, 8 Star Alaska.
Rex Cannon, co-president of 8 Star Alaska, said last month that the firm intends to make a final investment decision on the first phase of the project before the end of the year.
That first phase would consist of a pipeline for in-state gas customers. The second phase of the project includes a gas treatment facility and an export terminal on the Kenai Peninsula. A final investment decision on that aspect is expected in 2026.
Based on public announcements, 8 Star Alaska has not signed enough gas purchase agreements from North Slope producers to meet expected demand.
Previous proposed gas pipeline projects have failed in large part due to funding issues. Cannon said in August that 8 Star Alaska is pursuing federal loans from the Trump administration, and loans from outside investors in order to fund construction.
Gas purchase agreements like the ones announced this week are believed to be a key first step in showing the project is economical and worth investment.
The AKLNG pipeline is expected to have a final capacity of 20 million tons of natural gas per year. As of  Thursday, Glenfarne has announced preliminary commitments from buyers for approximately 12 million tons per year. 
Earlier this year, POSCO Holdings Inc., the parent company of POSCO International, said it was seeking to expand its liquefied natural gas businesses, partially in an effort to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s drive to boost U.S. exports.
Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly said that he sees the development of Alaska as a top priority.

Is there […]","Sunset veteran Robert F. Smalling, in front, poses after being presented an Orange Heart Medal from Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation Chairman Larry Kerr on Aug. 9, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)On Feb. 13, 2019, Tennessee lawmakers officially recognized the Orange Heart Medal, becoming the first state in the country to do so. Since that time, a number of other states have followed the Volunteer State’s lead. 
The Beehive State is currently not among the states that have formally recognized the Orange Heart Medal. Is there really any need for Utah legislators to approve an Orange Heart Medal to honor victims of Agent Orange exposure?
One could argue that Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides don’t really need any more recognition for their sacrifice.  After all, those veterans have already received an official federal service medal, the Vietnam Service Medal.
Additionally, Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides during the war are eligible for compensation from the Veterans Administration for illnesses associated with exposure to those chemicals. 
While the Vietnam Service Medal is a prestigious medal, it is awarded for a specific period of service performed in a specific area. A number of different awards are also authorized for circumstances that took place during the same period covered by the Vietnam Service Medal.
One notable example is the Purple Heart. That medal is awarded to service members wounded in action during wartime. It is not that uncommon for a veteran to receive a service medal and a Purple Heart during the same war.
In the case of VA compensation, many veterans do receive benefits for presumptive conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. However, the VA currently only recognizes a certain number of presumptive health issues linked to toxic herbicide exposure. That number could well increase.
Regardless of VA compensation for Agent Orange related illnesses received by eligible veterans, Purple Heart recipients also receive VA benefits in certain cases. One example is a veteran who became disabled due to a wound received in combat.  
A key difference between veterans who receive a Purple Heart and an Orange Heart Medal is the nature of the injury sustained. Purple Heart recipients were wounded externally, while Orange Heart Medal recipients were wounded internally. 
Like veterans who have received a Purple Heart for their obvious wounds, veterans exposed to Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides during the Vietnam War deserve an Orange Heart Medal for their inconspicuous wounds.
This rationale compelled Vietnam veteran Ken Gamble, founder and president of the Orange Heart Medal Foundation in Springfield, Tennessee, to design and create the Orange Heart Medal. 
Ken hopes the medal will eventually be approved in every state in the country. And there are certainly veterans in Utah who feel the same way. That was made clear by a recent Orange Heart Medal pinning ceremony in Sunset’s Rachael Runyan Memorial Park.
On Aug. 9, Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation Chairman Larry Kerr presented an Orange Heart Medal to Sunset veteran Robert F. Smalling in a solemn and emotional pinning ceremony. It was a ceremony that will no doubt take place with much greater frequency throughout the Beehive State.
The Orange Heart Medal is a very meaningful way to recognize veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange. So it is not really a question of whether lawmakers should approve an Orange Heart Medal. The real question is when will lawmakers approve a Utah Orange Heart Medal?",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Robert_F_Smalling_Orange_Heart_Medal-1024x967.jpg,,,2025-09-11 17:57:04.340222

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hours after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, a morose Utah Gov. Spencer Cox took the podium at a news conference alongside state and federal law enforcement officials. 
Cox — a Republican who has devoted a large part of his political career trying to encourage bipartisanship in an increasingly politically polarized world — did more than condemn Kirk’s killing, calling it a “political assassination.” 
“This is a dark day for our state,” the governor said. “It’s a tragic day for our nation.”
Though Cox has tried to combat polarization in favor of civil discourse through his Disagree Better campaign, his home state made worldwide headlines for the very thing he’s tried to discourage. Politico’s headline put it this way: “Utah is now the epicenter of the political divide its governor warned about.” 
While speaking about Kirk’s killing on Wednesday, Cox made another plea. He urged Utahns and Americans to look at the bigger picture of increased political violence happening across the country — and also look inward. 
“Our nation is broken,” he said. 

“Our nation is broken.”

Cox pointed to the assassination of Minnesota House Democratic leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, the firebombing of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home that prosecutors say was attempted murder, and attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. 
“Nothing I say can unite us as a country. Nothing I can say right now can fix what is broken,” he said. “Nothing I can say can bring back Charlie Kirk. Our hearts are broken.” 
As Cox gave his solemn speech, state public safety and FBI officials were hunting for the suspected shooter, who as of Thursday had still not been found. 
“Charlie Kirk was, first and foremost, a husband and a dad to two young children,” Cox said. “We mourn with his wife, his children, his families, his friends. We mourn as a nation.”

Kirk was also founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions, and a close ally of President Donald Trump. He was a widely known and often polarizing internet personality. 
That political involvement brought Kirk to Utah Valley University, one of the many college campuses across the U.S. where Kirk engaged students and members of the public in political debate with his signature “prove me wrong” events. But UVU was his last. 
An estimated 3,000 people attended Wednesday’s event. After the single gunshot rang out and Kirk collapsed from a bullet to his neck, students scattered, screaming in horror.  It was a moment that hundreds of students witnessed firsthand and now millions more around the world are viewing in viral, graphic videos that continue to spread on social media.
Cox lamented that university campuses are supposed to be places for students to learn and grow, not places where students fear for their safety.

“Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate, to shape ideas and to persuade people,” the governor said. “Historically, our university campuses in this nation and here in the state of Utah, have been the place where truth and ideas are formulated and debated. And that’s what he does. He comes on college campuses and he debates.” 
Free speech and debate are “foundational to the formation of our country, to our most basic constitutional rights,” Cox said. “And when someone takes the life of a person because of their ideas or their ideals, then that very constitutional foundation is threatened.”
As of Thursday, law enforcement officials had not released any information about the shooter’s motive and the investigation is ongoing. 
“I want to make it crystal clear right now, to whoever did this, we will find you. We will try you. And we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law,” Cox said. “And I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah.”

Cox also condemned anyone who may have reacted to Kirk’s killing with any level of celebration. 
“If anyone, in the sound of my voice, celebrated even a little bit at the news of the shooting, I would beg you to look in the mirror,” Cox said, “and see if you can find a better angel in there somewhere.” 
The governor said he didn’t care what Kirk’s politics were — “I care that he was an American.” 
“We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be. To ask ourselves, is this it? Is this what 250 years has brought on us? I pray that that’s not the case,” he said, pointing to the upcoming anniversary of the nation’s founding. 
Cox said he also prayed that “those who hated what Charlie Kirk stood for will put down their social media and their pens and pray for his family.” 
“And that all of us — all of us — will try to find a way to stop hating our fellow Americans,” Cox said.

Four public hearings this fall will review the reassessment process, property tax impacts, and education funding, as Republicans question the effort’s bipartisanship.
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE
DOVER — September 3, 2025 — Delaware lawmakers have created special House and Senate committees to review the state’s first comprehensive property reassessment in more than four decades, aiming to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.
House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown (D) and Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D) announced the committee assignments on Wednesday, emphasizing transparency and public engagement. The committees are scheduled to hold four public hearings between September and November, which will be livestreamed from Legislative Hall.
Purpose of the Committees
Legislative leaders said the committees are intended to identify lessons from the reassessment, recommend process improvements, and explore targeted tax relief options for Delawareans who may be facing significant property tax changes.
“We know that there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the reassessment process – both for Delawareans and for lawmakers,” said Speaker Minor-Brown. “These committees are about finding those answers and putting together a thoughtful roadmap that we can act on in the coming legislative session.”
Senate Majority Leader Bryan Townsend (D) said committee members were chosen for geographic balance and policy experience in housing and land use. “I look forward to putting our heads down and working together over the coming months to really drill down on what happened, and make recommendations about how we can move forward on behalf of the people of Delaware,” Townsend said.

Public Hearings: Topics and Timeline
The committees will hold four public hearings this fall, each addressing a different set of issues:

Week of September 22 – Review of the 2024 reassessment process

County-level practices, Tyler Technologies’ methodology, intergovernmental coordination, error safeguards, appeals process, and an update on emergency legislation passed August 12.


Week of October 6 – Future reassessments and tax structures

Comparative models from other states, potential differentiated tax rates by property type or size, and county-level capacity to implement such systems.


Week of October 20 – Delaware property tax framework and exemptions

Programs for taxpayers on fixed incomes or facing hardship, comparison to other states, and potential updates to property tax exemptions.


Week of November 3 – Property reassessment and education funding

The reassessment’s relationship to Delaware’s education funding system and the legal settlement that prompted the 2024 reassessment, as well as coordination with the Public Education Funding Commission.



Republican Caucus Raises Concerns Over Process
Following the announcement, the House Republican Caucus issued a statement criticizing how Democratic leaders initiated the reassessment review effort, arguing that Republican proposals were sidelined and that the committees were formed without bipartisan consultation.
“Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers: 27 of 41 seats in the House and 15 of 21 in the Senate. And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion,” the statement said.
Republicans said they were not given input or advance notice about the new committees and argued that earlier Republican-sponsored bills — including measures to double the senior property tax credit (HB 73) and limit tax hikes tied to reassessment (HB 245 and HB 246) — were ignored during the recent special session.
The statement also questioned the committee’s bipartisan nature:
“It’s clear Republican participation will serve only as window dressing, a superficial gesture intended solely to lend a veneer of bipartisanship to a process that is anything but.”
Looking Ahead
All committee meetings will be open to the public and livestreamed at legis.delaware.gov. Legislative leaders said additional details on the hearings and opportunities for public engagement will be announced in the coming days.
While Democrats frame the committees as a step toward transparency and solutions, and Republicans voice skepticism about the process, the hearings will give Delawareans a rare, statewide look at the property reassessment system and its potential long-term effects on taxes and school funding.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota economic development board this week approved up to $2.8 million in tax relief for a solar farm, a $10 million state loan for a cheese factory, and a $7,500 state grant to help local businesses grow. 
Officials expect the projects to result in a combined $395 million in private investment and create 163 jobs.
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

“We’re supporting a major expansion in food production, investing in renewable energy, and fueling local economic development,” Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a press release. “Each project strengthens our communities and ensures long-term growth for our state.”  
The Board of Economic Development approved the awards Wednesday. 
Bel Brands, known for producing mini-cheese wheels dipped in red wax, received approval for a state loan of up to $10 million. The loan, offered through the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative (REDI) Fund, provides low-interest, long-term financing for companies that want to expand or relocate in South Dakota. The company plans to build an additional 100,000 square feet of space at its Brookings plant, which would double its production capacity.
Grant Solar LLC received approval for up to $2.8 million in tax relief through the Reinvestment Payment Program to help build a 585-acre solar power facility in McCook County. The program refunds a portion of the state sales and use taxes paid on construction costs, with the goal of making capital projects more affordable to build in the state. Bel Brands was previously awarded up to $2.6 million in tax relief from the same program for its expansion.
Ally Dakota Development, a group with offices in Watertown and Rapid City that provides development support to local businesses, was awarded a $7,500 grant through the state’s Economic Development Partnership Program. The program provides small grants to help local organizations hire staff, run programs, or carry out projects that support business growth.

The six-page opinion overturned a circuit court judge’s decision last week that the state must hold onto its data on 3.3 million registered voters — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — while a lawsuit plays out over privacy concerns.
The U.S. Department of Justice asked for that information last month as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.

Opinopm 
Under the Supreme Court’s decision, the state Election Commission could hand over its voter information right away, said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is representing a voter suing to stop the release of her personal information.
Whether the commission will do so is unclear. An agency spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.
The agency began working to comply with the Trump administration’s request Aug. 27, three weeks after it sent the first of two letters asking for the information, spokesman John Michael Catalano said previously. The Department of Justice set a due date of Sept. 5, two days after the circuit court judge’s order barred the state from complying.
The Supreme Court’s order, which all five justices signed, didn’t get into the questions of privacy raised in the lawsuit. Instead, justices focused on procedural issues in the order barring the state from fulfilling the request.
Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein didn’t explain in her order what sort of damage Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the lawsuit, might face if the state gives her information to the federal government, according to the Supreme Court’s order. Goodstein also failed to explain whether she believed the lawsuit was likely to succeed, which is required for a court to intervene, the order reads.
Goodstein told the Election Commission not to comply with the request before the agency had even received notice of the lawsuit, which was filed Aug. 29 ahead of the Labor Day weekend. That on its own violates longstanding court precedent, the state’s highest court said.
She scheduled a hearing for Wednesday morning in Aiken County but canceled it after the state Election Commission appealed to the Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will continue. Justices made it clear Crook can still ask for a hearing in her case. Where and when that might happen is still to be determined.
“We still are going to get our day in court,” said Hutto, D-Orangeburg.
Governor joins the lawsuit
Although the initial lawsuit didn’t name Gov. Henry McMaster as a defendant, he asked to join in defense of the state Election Commission.
The request “should not be a big deal,” McMaster’s attorney wrote last Thursday in response to the lawsuit.
Anyone can purchase partial voter records, including full names, addresses and birthdays. Also, federal agencies — including the IRS and Social Security Administration — already have most of the information requested, McMaster’s filing argued.
“The federal government already has Crook’s full Social Security number (as well as every other South Carolinian’s) because the federal government issues those Social Security numbers,” the governor’s attorney wrote. “It’s untenable (to put it mildly) to insist that the State cannot tell the federal government something that the federal government already knows.”
The governor’s office did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment on the high court’s decision.
Judge temporarily blocks release of SC voter data to Trump administration

While it’s true that some government agencies have access to personal information, the Department of Justice clearly isn’t among them, Hutto said. If it were, the agency wouldn’t be asking for states to provide that information, he said.
McMaster told reporters last week that he would like to enter a formal agreement with the Department of Justice making it clear that the agency will respect voters’ privacy rights.
However, those privacy rights don’t extend to voter registration information, his attorneys argued in a court filing. South Carolinians have a right to privacy only from electronic surveillance and in cases of bodily autonomy, McMaster’s filing reads.
Federal law gives government agencies the authority to get whatever data they need to fulfill their obligations, McMaster’s attorneys argued. That includes the Department of Justice, which is tasked with enforcing voter laws, his office wrote.
“Nothing is unreasonable about giving the federal government information it already has (Social Security numbers) or information that Congress has authorized it to obtain (driver’s license numbers),” the filing reads.
Those laws apply only if the agency has a good reason to get the information, which the Department of Justice hasn’t proven, Hutto argued.
If the Department of Justice said exactly what it planned to do with people’s personal information, voters like Crook might not be so concerned about violations to their privacy, Hutto said.
“Why do they need to know?” Hutto said. “That is the very data everyone says we need to safeguard from identity theft.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Headquarters-Voting-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

 Chris Nordstrum, the communications director for Senate Democrats, initially confirmed the threat to Source New Mexico. Wirth subsequently issued a statement mid-afternoon acknowledging that a threat had been made against him, “leading to disruption and an evacuation at schools in my neighborhood. I am grateful to our state and local law enforcement agencies for their swift and professional response to this serious matter, and to the school officials who skillfully managed the disturbance.”
“Political violence and threats against elected officials have no place in our democratic society and are never an acceptable way to address political differences. Regardless of our political views, we must reject intimidation and work together through peaceful, lawful means to resolve our disagreements.”

Wirth concluded the statement by saying he remains “committed to fostering respectful civic dialogue and protecting the safety of all who serve our community.”
New Mexico State Police initially posted on social media a little after 12 p.m. on Thursday that a bomb threat had been called in somewhere in the area of Camino De Cruz Blanca in Santa Fe between Camino Del Monte Sol and Calle Romolo. 
A statement from City of Santa Fe Deputy Police Chief Ben Valdez provided to Source said that city and state police initially responded to a bomb threat in the 1000 block of Camino de Cruz Blanca at approximately 10:40 am.  SFPD provided patrol officers for scene security and traffic control, and its Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit to investigate the threat.
“Contact was made with leadership at Santa Fe Prep to inform them of an incident near their campus. Santa Fe Prep was evacuated, parents were contacted to pick up their students.  Both NMSP and SFPD were present with the students and faculty as a controlled release was conducted and students were released to their parents,” Valdez’s statement said.

At the same time, Santa Fe Police received “another threat of the same nature” on a nearby street.

“Out of an abundance of caution, considering yesterday’s senseless killing of political activist Charlie Kirk, City Hall was placed on a lockdown,” Valdez wrote. That lockdown was lifted at 1:47 p.m.

“We take all threats seriously,” Valdez’s statement said. “They have no place in our community and individuals that make threats will be held accountable.”
In the aftermath of Wednesday’s fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, threats Thursday at colleges in Virginia and Historically Black Colleges and University campuses across the country have led to lockdowns and canceled classes.

Thomas/Getty Images).A Jackson County judge is weighing whether to keep in place two state regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing its providers from performing medication abortions in Missouri.
Over the course of several hours Wednesday, attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office argued before Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang over whether current regulations on abortion medication — the most common kind of abortion — are a necessary safeguard or onerous and unconstitutional.
In November, Missouri voters legalized abortion up to fetal viability. But abortion remains widely inaccessible to most Missourians as a number of related legal cases play out in the courts. 
Procedural abortions are again accessible on a limited schedule at Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. But medication abortions are not available because Planned Parenthood does not have an approved medication abortion complication plan or supplemental insurance required by state regulations.
Missouri abortion rights amendment trumps most restrictions, judge rules

Planned Parenthood continues to argue that these restrictions fly in the face of the abortion rights amendment, which reads: “The government shall not discriminate against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.”
Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general involved in the lawsuit, argued Wednesday that “regulation and medicine go together.”
Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney for Planned Parenthood, countered that the complication plan puts the state “squarely between patients and providers” by forcing “medically unnecessary requirements.” 
In late March, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services rejected Planned Parenthood’s complication plan, stating that it did not meet the requirements of a new emergency rule published the same day by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office. 
That rule requires the complication plan for any facility prescribing abortion medication to more than 10 women a month must: 

Have an on-call OB-GYN who lives within 25 miles of the clinic available at all times for seven days after a patient takes the medication. This physician would be required to treat any complications that arise as a result of the medication unless the standard of care requires someone else to treat them. 
Provide for patients who live further than 25 miles from the clinic the name of the emergency room and a physician “within a reasonable distance of the location where the patient will complete the abortion.”
Submit the full names of all physicians involved in the local complication plans.

A medication abortion requires two different kinds of pills. The first, mifepristone, causes the embryo or fetus to stop growing and detach from the uterine wall, ending the pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy tissue. 
Both medications can also be used to treat miscarriages.
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects. Hemorrhaging and infection are among rare complications. 
Since the medication was approved for use 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been reported associated with mifepristone, according to the FDA. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Wednesday’s hearing included testimony from two OB-GYNS: Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, and Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs for Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion research group.
Baum said a complication plan is not required when she performs vasectomies at the clinic, even though she said the risk of infection is greater for that procedure.
Between April 2018 and August 2023, there were 438 abortion complication reports — including 186 from medication abortions — filed with Missouri’s health department. Details on individual cases were not presented. 
In her testimony, Skop suggested the number of complications could be higher. It is difficult to collect accurate data, she claimed, because many women are advised by abortion providers not to tell primary care or emergency room doctors that they had an abortion if seeking further treatment. 
Baum said that’s because miscarriage and medication abortion present the same and require the same treatment, so choosing not to disclose an abortion can protect a patient’s privacy. She added that when she administers mifepristone to patients at her clinics in Illinois before sending them home with a dose of misoprostol, she gives them multiple ways to reach a provider if they have concerns that they are bleeding too much or are experiencing any other complications.
Missouri law also requires providers prescribing abortion medication to carry tail insurance, a supplemental plan to medical malpractice insurance that would extend coverage for 21 years following the administration of the medication in case there is a claim of “personal injury to or death of a child who survives such abortion.”
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood have argued in briefings that this 2019 law is also discriminatory because it’s not required for other medical events such as childbirth, which carries much higher risks of injury or death. 
Among the state’s witnesses was Melissa Ohden, founder and CEO of the Abortion Survivors Network, based in Kansas City, which connects women who underwent failed abortions and their families with resources. Ohden is also an outspoken opponent of any abortion exceptions. 
“The reality is that abortions fail far more frequently than women are told about,” she testified Wednesday, based on anecdotal data she said she’s gathered over years of working with thousands of people through her organization.
If a medication abortion fails, patients can take another dose of medication or undergo an in-clinic abortion, according to Planned Parenthood’s website.
While Pai-Thompson, Planned Parenthood’s attorney, said the restriction is another attempt to subject abortion providers to licensing penalties, Donohue argued it was in place to protect doctors. 
A “rural woman” might not know a “big, fancy” medical word like mifepristone, Donohue said. He then gave a hypothetical of a woman accidentally “overdosing” on mifepristone because her local doctor didn’t have access to medical records indicating she was already prescribed mifepristone by Planned Parenthood.

Missouri judge weighing whether new abortion ban should appear on 2026 ballot

Missouri has a long history of imposing “targeted regulation of abortion providers” laws.
These regulations played a large role in reducing the number of abortions in Missouri from more than 5,000 a decade ago to 167 in 2020, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
As the medication abortion regulations hearing played out in downtown Kansas City on Wednesday, the Missouri Court of Appeals was hearing arguments down the street in the Missouri attorney general’s attempt to overturn a preliminary injunction issued by Zhang allowing clinics across the state to resume procedural abortions for the first time in years.
The attorney general’s office is asking the appeals court to reverse that decision and again make procedural abortions inaccessible in Missouri.
The appeal was initially filed by Bailey, who recently resigned to become co-deputy director of the FBI. Catherine Hanaway, a former lawmaker and U.S. attorney, has taken his place.  
Gillian Wilcox, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, said it’s yet to be seen if the change in leadership will change the office’s approach to the several abortion-related cases it’s involved in.
“At this point we expect the state to do everything in their power to have all of the restrictions on abortion care stay in place,” Wilcox said, “despite the amendment that the voters passed.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/planned-parenthood-2-e1707947543157.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)BECKLEY, W.Va. — A former West Virginia health officer testified Thursday that the state’s compulsory vaccination law, as it’s written without religious or philosophical exemptions, is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals. 
“At the end of the day, the… compulsory vaccine law actually is about creating healthy communities,” Dr. Cathy Slemp said. “It’s about protecting the health and safety of children, having a well vaccinated population so that we decrease disease spread and the occurrence of outbreaks.”
Slemp was West Virginia’s state health officer from 2002 to 2011 and again from 2018 through 2020. She testified Thursday during a hearing in Raleigh County Circuit Court. 
Circuit Judge Michael Froble is overseeing two consolidated lawsuits in a battle over the state’s school vaccination law and religious freedom. 
In one case, Miranda Guzman and other families are suing the West Virginia Board of Education and the Raleigh County Board of Education so that their children may attend school with a religious exemption for vaccines. The state school board has directed county boards not to accept religious exemptions. 
Froble in July issued a preliminary ruling allowing students in the case to attend class, but the ruling is limited to those students. The hearing Thursday was on a permanent injunction in the case. 
The other case is a lawsuit filed by Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson, parents of immunocompromised children, who are suing the state Department of Health to stop it from issuing religious exemptions. The plaintiffs in that case are represented by the American Civil LIberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
All states require students attending school to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow students to opt out of the vaccination requirements because of philosophical or religious objections to the shots. 
In January, Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have established the exemptions in state code. 
As health officer, one part of Slemp’s job was to review appeals of decisions of the state immunization officer about medical vaccines exemptions.
Slemp said the state has gotten on average 50 applications for medical exemptions per year over the last seven years, about 80% of which are approved. 
By contrast, the state health department has gotten 570 applications for religious or philosophical exemptions for the 2025-2026 school year, Froble said. 
She said even small percentages of religious and philosophical exemptions increase disease. 
“They look like small numbers, but they are significant,” Slemp said. 
Slemp said states that allow religious exemptions see a “multifold” increase of vaccination exemptions overall, which can contribute to disease outbreaks. 
“So that does increase at a population level, the number of people that are unvaccinated, and that then therefore leads to increased risk of disease and outbreaks,” Slemp said. 
Non-medical exemptions also tend to be in clusters, compared to medical exemptions which are evenly distributed, Slemp said. Different diseases require different levels of vaccination for “herd immunity.” So some counties may have higher risk than others. 
Froble said Thursday that the state Department of Health has not said which of the 570 exemptions that have been sought are for religious versus philosophical reasons. 
The distinction is important, he said. 
Morrisey’s executive order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which says that “no state action may burden a person’s exercise of freedom of religion, unless doing so is essential and is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.”
“If we are to really determine the application of the Equal Protection [for Religion Act], I believe the board is restricted only to consider religious exceptions, not philosophical exemptions,” he said. “They wouldn’t apply under the Equal Protection [for Religion Act.]”
Froble said part of the compelling state interest in the case is that if religious exemptions to the state school vaccination law are allowed, it may “open the floodgate” for people who don’t have religious beliefs but don’t like vaccines to get exemptions. 
“I believe the court is very concerned with trying to protect the religious beliefs of individuals, but also believes that is a very compelling interest by the state to make sure that we protect children in our school… I think that’s a paramount issue that we need to address in this case,” Froble said. 
Chris Weist, an attorney for families suing the state Board of Education, said he doesn’t know if the agency has a breakdown of philosophical and religious exemptions. 
“I want to be clear, we’ve never made a claim in this case that our particular plaintiffs are entitled to enforce the exemptions that they’ve gotten from the health department necessarily,” he said. “What we said is, ‘we’ve got an EPRA claim. Our clients have sincerely held religious beliefs. That triggers EPRA.’”
Weist said one of the reasons they haven’t asked for a statewide ruling is because determining whether the 570 exemptions are religious or philosophical reasons would be challenging. 
“I’ll be candid with the court, our team has discussed class wide relief, and that issue of, is it religious, or is it something else is a challenge to that,” Weist said. 
Holly Wilson, an attorney for the state Department of Health argued that there is no distinction between a religious and a philosophical exemption. 
“The West Virginia Supreme Court has already construed the term religious or religion for purposes of the First Amendment free exercise clause that religion encompasses philosophical objections,” she said. “These are one and the same… you can’t break these two things apart because they are the same.”
The judge gave counsel in the lawsuits two weeks to write briefs about religious versus philosophical exemptions. 
The hearing in the case is expected to continue.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 20:39:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Howard Sovronsky named CT behavioral health advocate,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/howard-sovronsky-named-ct-behavioral-health-advocate/,The CT Office of the Behavioral Health Advocate aims to help residents access behavioral health services and help providers receive payments.,"Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday announced the creation of a new state office focused on eliminating barriers to behavioral health care in Connecticut and nominated Howard Sovronsky, a former social worker with leadership experience in both government and health care, as its inaugural head.
The Connecticut Office of the Behavioral Health Advocate will help residents access behavioral health services and help providers receive payments from insurers for the care they provide.
“Access to mental health services is one of the most pressing needs of our time, and it needs to be treated just as we do for any other physical health situation,” Lamont stated in a press release. “This new office will provide the residents of our state with an advocate to help break down the barriers that still stand in the way of true mental health equity.”
Most recently, Sovronsky served as chief behavioral health officer at Connecticut Children’s in Hartford, and he has more than 40 years of experience as a licensed clinical social worker. He also worked in Nassau County, Long Island’s local government for two decades, including a stint as the commissioner of the county’s Department of Mental Health and Development Disabilities. 
In his new role as the behavioral health advocate, Sovronsky wants to hear from people who receive behavioral health services about what improvements the system needs.
“The answers are out there. We have to be nimble enough and open enough to hear them,” Sovronsky told legislators during a confirmation hearing in March.
A national report published last year ranked Connecticut among the top 10 states for access to mental health care. Still, issues persist, particularly in the face of a “dramatic increase in demand” for services, Sovronsky told legislators.
“We should all be proud that Connecticut has one of the most highly developed behavioral health systems in the country,” he said. “Yet individuals and families continue to struggle, navigating a system that is fragmented and confusing.” 
Last year, the state Office of Health Strategy found that roughly 1.5 million residents lived in areas where the demand for mental health services exceeded the capacity of local providers. Statewide, adults earning low incomes reported feeling chronically depressed at five times the rate of those earning high incomes. Demand for mental health services for children, in particular, continues to climb. 
In his new role, Sovronsky will also help behavioral health providers receive timely payments from insurance carriers and advocate for greater access to behavioral health services.
In 2019, Connecticut passed a law requiring what’s known as “mental health parity,” meaning insurers cannot place greater restrictions on access to mental health services than on surgical or medical care. During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers added teeth to the measure, allowing the Insurance Commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance. 
During a hearing earlier this year, behavioral health providers testified that they often hear from patients who can’t access treatment they need because payers are less likely to provide adequate coverage for mental health services.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8544-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

The monitor’s latest report, released Thursday, Sept. 11, shows about 7.33% of the state experiencing “extreme drought” conditions.
“Extreme drought occurs when conditions are dry enough to cause water shortages, particularly for agriculture and for residents who rely on well water,” said New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone in a Sept. 11 email to the Bulletin. Farmers in areas under this classification could see widespread crop loss, according to the National Weather Service.
The monitor relies on data tracking rainfall, stream flow, soil moisture content, reservoir levels, and more to draw its drought maps, according to the website. Extreme drought conditions are the third most extreme of four drought categories represented by the monitor. 
“This time of year, drought can enhance wildfire hazard and negatively impact fall foliage and crop health,” Stampone said. If the ground freezes before the drought ends, she added, it will become more difficult for the ground to “recharge” with groundwater — “essentially locking hydrologic drought in place through the cold season,” she said.
The state recommends mandatory water conservation measures during times of extreme drought, Stampone said, but whether to impose restrictions on water use is ultimately up to municipalities.
Across much of the rest of New Hampshire, a drought of lower classification is ongoing, with most of the northern half of the state experiencing “severe drought,” according to the monitor. Much of the rest of the state is experiencing moderate drought, leaving less than 10% of the state outside the drought conditions — although that area, which stretches between Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, is classified by the monitor as “abnormally dry.”
Despite a rainy spring and early summer, New Hampshire was plunged into drought conditions in a matter of weeks this summer. Stampone said in an interview with the Bulletin earlier in September that such a swing could become characteristic of the state’s changing climate, with rainy springs followed by the potential for hot, dry summers.
Though droughts have long been a reality in New Hampshire, they are becoming more intense with climate change, Stampone said then. The drought conditions have made for a challenging growing season for farmers across the state, who are contending with water scarcity they said has become a seasonal pattern.
And the speed with which the weather can swing from damp to dry makes it important to conserve water even when the need may not seem pressing, she added.
“When we do go into drought, we tend to go into it quickly,” she said. “Water conservation is something that should always be on our minds, even in times when we are wet.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nhdrought-1024x609.png,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

“This is an age of ideological turmoil, turmoil frequently manifested on our college campuses. The state of Florida and the UF administration and board leadership responded crisply to the post-Oct. 7 unrest. I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility,” Landry said. 
Landry’s confirmation came one day after the shooting death of political commentator Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University.
Landry was announced as UF trustees’ choice for interim president on Aug. 25. He started the job Sept. 1, but his position was not finalized until BOG approval.
The university needed to find a new interim president after former President Kent Fuchs’ interim contract expired. The first search for a president after the resignation of former President Ben Sasse ended with the BOG rejecting Santa Ono, former president of the University of Michigan. That meant another search couldn’t be completed before Fuchs’ contract expired.
“It’s been said by people in the last few years, especially in the last year, that the state of Florida, because of what we’ve done, we won’t be able to attract great presidential candidates. And if you look around the room, I think we’ve got some of the best presidents in the country,” Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine said. 
Landry’s contract would pay him $2 million if he is not named UF’s formal president at the end of his interim stint.

The provision follows concerns that candidates might be scared to apply for the presidency if there was a chance they would end up jobless after quitting their previous job, like Ono did.
“We are excited to see what UF can accomplish under his leadership,” UF Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini said of Landry. Hosseini previously called Ono’s rejection “deeply disappointing.”
Landry’s contract will provide him a base salary of $2 million with a $500,000 performance incentive.
As president, Sasse was paid a $1 million base salary in a contract worth $10 million over five years. Florida State University President Richard McCullough just received a raised base salary of $1.25 million for the last year of his five-year contract.
“UF is on the ascendant and I enthusiastically endorse and will tirelessly work to achieve this aspiration,” Landry said, noting that UF is “clearly in the top five, arguably the best.”
The Board of Governors concluded its two-day meeting on New College of Florida’s campus with Landry’s vote. 
The University of Florida has yet to announce a new presidential search committee.

Sept. 10, 2025 | Photo courtesy of Michigan Energy, Michigan JobsHundreds of environmental advocates and community leaders gathered in downtown Lansing Wednesday for a day of action that included live music and commentary from activists and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
The event was led by Michigan Energy, Michigan Jobs, which included speakers in state Reps. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) and Timmy Beson (R-Bangor Township), and state Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing).
“Today’s event showed the strength and unity of Michiganders who know that clean energy is the key to strengthening affordability, creating healthier communities, and building a stronger economy,” Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director for Climate and Energy at the Natural Resources Defence Council said. “Seeing people from all walks of life gather at the Capitol demonstrates the broad support for policies that keep energy affordable, reliable, and homegrown here in Michigan.”
Those who participated in the event highlighted the economic benefits of clean energy, and the negative health impacts brought by fossil fuels. 
“Protecting the health of Michigan families must be at the center of energy policy,” Dr. Lisa Del Buono, board chair of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action said. “As clinicians, we see how fossil fuel pollution drives asthma and respiratory illness, especially in children and seniors. By accelerating the shift to clean, reliable energy, lawmakers can help ensure every child grows up breathing cleaner air.”
Attendees also advocated for community solar, which would allow Michigan communities to lower their energy bills by subscribing to a local solar energy project.
“Community solar is one of the smartest ways Michigan can grow its clean energy economy,” Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director for Vote Solar said. “These projects keep investment and decision-making local, creating jobs, strengthening our farms and businesses, and helping families save on their electric bills. By expanding community solar, we can deliver both energy independence and economic opportunity to communities across the state.”

(NOAA archive photo)Federal legislation introduced jointly by U.S. Sens. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, and Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, seeks to establish a fire weather program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The legislation passed the Senate unanimously on Sept. 10. 
“As a former aerial firefighter, one of my top priorities since taking office has been to reform our federal wildland firefighting apparatus to better protect our communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “The Fire Ready Nation Act ensures we can better predict these disasters and respond quickly to prevent the devastation to families, homes, and businesses that is caused by catastrophic wildfire.”
Fire weather describes certain conditions that lead to an elevated level of alert. Wind and humidity, for example, are two factors taken into account. Wildfire smoke is also tracked by federal agencies, and that information is then disseminated to the public. Many state agencies, including Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality, also track smoke impacts.
Earlier this year, Cantewell said more than 300,000 acres burned in Washington last year, and wildfires in California in January demonstrated the nation was facing “costly, unpredictable wildfires year-round.
“The Fire Ready Nation Act can help save homes and lives by giving scientists and weather forecasters on the front lines of wildfires innovative tools to better predict wildfire and smoke conditions,” Cantell said in a Jan. 30 press release.
The legislation is seeking to address a gap, a Cantwell release said.
“(NOAA) has no defined authority in law for its wildfire services. And while NOAA is a world leader in wildfire forecasting, better coordination and funding for new high-tech initiatives would help improve forecasting and preparedness,” the release stated.
The Department of Government Efficiency cut employees at the National Weather Service earlier this year, though the Trump administration has since sought to rehire them.
According to the bill text, program priorities include creating an improved fire-weather model that includes variables important for firefighters to know. It also asks the agency to implement artificial intelligence and cloud computing when creating the program. There’s also an ask for “a rapidly deployable network of rain gauges for post-fire hazard monitoring,” the bill states.
The hope is to update and upgrade weather models and make that information easily available to those that depend on it.
In addition, the bill would also “establish and maintain” an Incident Meteorologist Service within the National Weather Service. It appears they would be providing on-site support services during weather incidents that includes fires.
The bill also asks for various working groups to address issues, including communication between different agencies. It’s asking for an appropriation of $118 million over the next five years, according to the bill text.
Statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center say that more than 48,000 wildfire incidents have been reported year-to-date. Those fires have burned 4,320,279 acres across the country this year.
Fires have been a focus for Sheehy, with the Fire Ready Nation Act his second piece of fire legislation that’s passed the body unanimously.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 20:20:27+00:00,CT Mirror,Western Mass. working to halt sewage flowing into CT,"Hallie Claflin, CommonWealth Beacon",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/western-mass-sewage-ct-river/,The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by sewer overflows that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.,"Reports of toilet paper, raw sewage, and other discarded items flowing through the Connecticut River in Suffield and Enfield went viral in recent weeks as Connecticut state Rep. Tami Zawistowski pointed the finger at Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee.  
“They all have issues that have emerged in recent years,” Zawistowski told WTNH News 8, claiming Holyoke alone “dumped” seven million gallons of sewage into the river in one day. “It’s time for Massachusetts to step up.” 
Officials in the cities that have been singled out say the “issues” that have emerged are intensifying rain events due to climate change.  
The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.  
Cities like Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee have historically combined sewer systems where both wastewater and stormwater come through shared pipes. During heavy rains, the excess flow bypasses the treatment plants where it is supposed to be cleaned and is instead discharged into local bodies of water to prevent backups in people’s homes.  
All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent overflows and have reached the final stages of separating their stormwater and sewer systems, significantly reducing their annual discharges. But as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress. 
Funding the expensive projects required to update the sewer systems is a daunting task, and the three Gateway Cities often lack the taxpayer base to pay for it.  
“By no means would I say that Chicopee, Holyoke, and Springfield have done nothing,” Springfield Water and Sewer Commission Executive Director Josh Schimmel said. “If we could wave a wand and make them go away tomorrow, we would, but we serve a disadvantaged population that pays for it.” 
Mary Monahan, interim director of Holyoke Public Works, said the city has already eliminated 70 percent of the overflows outlined in their legally binding performance improvement plan established with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Justice Department. Previous CSOs in Holyoke violated federal and state wastewater discharge permits, according to the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office. 
“On a normal day, we’re only using half the capacity of the plant,” Monahan said. “It’s only this rainfall that overwhelms it. Climate change is definitely exacerbating this issue.” 
Two projects amounting to $22.5 million are in the works now. River Terrace Phase A and B will continue the city’s efforts to separate the two systems and mitigate CSO events. Holyoke generally secures funding for CSO projects through the EPA’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which offers no interest loans.  
Last year, the city applied for a $19 million grant through the EPA’s Community Change Grants Program, a Biden-era initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that provides funding to disadvantaged communities for environmental projects. While waiting in the queue to be funded, the program was cancelled in May by the EPA under the Trump administration.  
The grant was going to help fund a new centrifuge in Holyoke’s treatment plant, which removes liquid from the waste sludge and lowers disposal costs. It is expected to cost between $3 million and $4 million.  
“For a city like Holyoke, it really is a financial burden,” Monahan said. “Our ratepayers are paying almost $2 million a year in debt service, and River Terrace Phase B is going to add more.”  
The city is required to report the volume of discharge associated with CSOs each time there is a rain event. While Zawistowski was correct in claiming that seven million gallons had been discharged into the river in one day, Monahan estimates that nearly five million of that had already been treated in their plant. She says the city is working on revising how they report CSO volumes.  
“Ninety-nine percent of the overflow could be rainwater, which is technically clean, and 1 percent of it could be the sewage that was in the pipe,” Chicopee Water Pollution Control project supervisor Quinn Lonczak said. “It’s hard to know what is actually going out.”  
Monahan and Lonczak, along with city officials from Springfield, say they want to see the Connecticut River clean as much as anyone else does.  
“If it’s a regional rain event and all of the other plants are overflowing, sure, there’s going to be water quality issues and everything coming downstream,” Monahan said. “We’re really easy to pick on.”  
In Chicopee, between 80 and 85 percent of the city’s average annual discharge has been eliminated, according to Lonczak. Between 60 and 65 percent of their long-term CSO control plan projects have been completed. Since 2000, the city has spent close to $250 million on CSO-related projects. 
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not a cheap fix. And it’s not something that we ignore,” Lonczak said. “We’ve done a lot of projects here, spent a lot of money, and nearly all of that money is local. Our ratepayers here are paying for those projects.”  
While making considerable progress, Lonczak anticipates that completing the targeted projects will cost another $100 million before inflation. Some parts of the system are still combined, but don’t discharge a significant amount. He said the challenge is that now the city is left with project areas that will cost a lot but will ultimately remove only a small amount of overflow.  
A Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection report released in May showed that 543 million gallons of wastewater overflowed into the Connecticut River last year across 12 days with weather events, compared to nearly one billion gallons in 2023.  
“There’s a plan, and it may not be going as fast as the state of Connecticut wants, unless somebody starts writing some checks,” Lonczak said. “If you wanted to eliminate CSOs in Chicopee in five years … is it possible? Anything’s possible, it’s just the dollar amount.” 
Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995, according to the EPA.  
“We can handle regular rain. We’re going to get an inch and a half of rain over 12 hours? That’s no problem. We’re designed for that,” Lonczak said. “It’s short-duration, high-intensity events.”  
Springfield is less concerned with separating their sewer systems, according to Schimmel. Their CSO elimination projects involve a mix of separation in some areas, increased treatment plant capacity, and creating in-system storage. He says complete separation could solve one problem while creating another.  
“You can eliminate 100 percent of CSOs, and storm water alone is going to violate water quality standards every time it rains,” Schimmel said. “Although storm water is more dilute pollution by volume, it’s every bit as harmful as CSO. Separation reduces your combined sewer overflow, but it increases your stormwater.”  
Springfield has spent approximately $300 million on CSO projects, according to Schimmel, which have eliminated more than 50 percent of its CSOs in the last two decades.  
In the years following the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act, the construction of wastewater treatment plants was largely paid for by the federal government through grants. Local entities paid a small portion of the cost. Municipalities must now pick up most of the cost, while state and federal agencies finance small, if any portions of their projects, Schimmel added. 
“There’s never been free money since the 70s and early 80s for any of us to do CSO work,” he said. “The pendulum has swung completely to the other side. It needs to come back to the middle to some degree.”  
He takes issue with river alliance and environmental advocacy groups referring to the city as “polluters.”  
“How about you put all of that effort into advocating your state legislators to get us money to fix the problem?” Schimmel said.

A small but pensive crowd gathered together Thursday morning at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter to observe the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.
People silently entered the Wall of Honor, which is in the center portion of the cemetery, via a walkway flanked on each side by members of the Rhode Island Patriot Guard Riders standing at attention, holding flags. 
Debbie Kane of The Rhode Island Highlanders played the bagpipes before the speaking program began. 
Among those who delivered remarks was Lt. Col. Andrew C. Cairns, professor of the University of Rhode Island’s ROTC program, who shared his memory of watching the clear blue sky fill with smoke across the New York skyline from his high school classroom in New Jersey.
Other speakers were The Rev. William Reynolds of the Beacon Church in Exeter; Paul Murgo, administrator of the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, and George Lieb of the Exeter #1 Volunteer Fire Department. 
Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, presented a proclamation to William Pennoyer of the American Legion. The proclamation states that new legislation passed this year by the General Assembly allows teachers or administrators in Rhode Island public schools to hold a brief moment of silence after the pledge of allegiance on the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001. The new law, ceremonially signed Thursday afternoon by Gov. Dan McKee, was modeled on a measure enacted in New York to commemorate the attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon.
Followed by the bugle call of the Rhode Island Funeral Honors Team playing “To The Colors.”
The ceremony continued with the laying of a memorial wreath, the reading of the names of the Rhode Islanders lost in the attacks, and the “Striking of the Four Fives” — a ceremonial ringing of five bell strikes repeated in four series, a tradition that signifies the death of a firefighter in the line of duty.
Exeter Town Council Vice President Ray Morrisfield gave the crowd a few words to contemplate before the ceremony ended with a rifle volley by the Rhode Island Funeral Honors Team, standing high upon a hill.
“Up to 9/11, we would say let the dead rest in peace, but today let us say, let the living live in peace,” Morrisfield said.

(Photo by Brandon O’Connor, NRCS/USDA )The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it had improved and expanded its Farm to School Grant program and would invest up to $18 million to connect locally grown food to child nutrition programs. 
The Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants program was initiated in 2013, but according to a news release, the fiscal year 2026 investment represents the “largest total amount” the department has offered in a given year. 
The Farm to School Grant announcement was made alongside U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s latest Make America Healthy Again report, which called for more whole, unprocessed foods in children’s diets.

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the grants are “one of the best ways we can deliver nutritious, high-quality meals to children, while also strengthening local agriculture.” 
“These grants will open new doors for small family farms, expand access to healthy food in schools, and inspire the next generation of Great American Farmers,” Rollins said in the news release. 
State agencies, tribal organizations, child nutrition programs, nonprofits, agricultural producers and groups of producers can apply for grants from $100,000 to $500,000 to support new and existing farm to school projects, according to the grant website. 
Eligible projects are those that: incorporate more unprocessed and locally produced foods in school meals, encourage the consumption of fresh foods, train producers on food safety and procurement requirements or educate students on agriculture and nutrition.
The release from USDA said updates to the program will also streamline the application process, remove barriers to innovation and emphasize partnerships.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, USDA is proud to streamline this program, so it works better for families, farmers, and communities across our nation,” Rollins said in the release. “Putting America’s Farmers First starts with putting our children first.”
According to USDA’s latest Farm to School Census, more than 440 Iowa school food authorities, the entities that manage school food service, have participated in the program.
The grants can also be used to support agriculture education at schools through things like ag and nutrition classes, or school gardening programs. According to the census, nearly 50% of Iowa school food authorities had classroom programs and slightly more than 15% of Iowa school food authorities had edible gardens. 
According to USDA, Farm to School Grant awards totaled $100 million since 2013. 
The millions in Farm to School Grant dollars are significantly less than the billions of dollars that schools and food banks used under a pandemic-era program to support local food purchases. 
These programs, Local Food for Schools and Local Food Purchase Assistance, were canceled in March after USDA announced in October 2024 over a $1 billion in funds to continue the programs across the country. 
Tommy Hexter, the policy director for Iowa Farmers Union, said the new investment from USDA is positive, but said it doesn’t make up for the loss of programs that provided “vital government support” to food farmers and players in the local food system.
Hexter said the canceled programs created relationships between farmers, food hubs, the state department of agriculture, schools and community, that are “fundamental to our food system in Iowa.”
“The first and foremost thing with this announcement is like, yes, let’s see how we can take advantage of this new announcement and make these programs come to Iowa,” Hexter said. “But we also are acknowledging that this investment does not replace the major loss of funding that happened earlier this year.”

From January through August, Arkansans bought $193.1 million in medical marijuana products from the state’s dispensaries, compared with $182.5 million in the same period last year, according to a press release from the state Department of Finance and Administration.
“With daily sales averaging about $800,000 in 2025, we are on track to surpass the 2023 sales record of $283 million,” department spokesperson Scott Hardin said.
There has also been a significant year-to-year increase in the number of pounds of cannabis sold, Hardin said, with the 2025 total at 52,292 pounds.
The state collected $5.38 million in tax revenue from medical marijuana in July and August, bringing the total tax haul so far this year to $21.57 million.
Patients spent $24,262,201 in July, purchasing 6,721 pounds, and $24,647,170 in August, buying 6,778 pounds, according to the finance department.
Suite 443 in Hot Springs and Natural Relief Dispensary in Sherwood sold the most medical marijuana in both July and August, according to the press release. Suite 443 sold 1,419.6 pounds total for both months. Natural Relief sold 1,317.7 pounds over July and August.
“A total of $1.5 billion has been spent on medical marijuana since the state’s first dispensary opened in May 2019,” Hardin said.
The Arkansas Department of Health reports 109,060 active patient cards. The Medical Marijuana Commission has licensed 38 dispensaries but only 36 are operating, Hardin said. The license of one of the closed dispensaries was revoked by the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board last year, and its owner’s appeal of the revocation remains before the courts.

Restoring Every Aspect of Life begins with hope and someone by
your side while you take the first step.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Recovery is REAL in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom.","Every September, communities and care providers across the nation,including in the Northeast Kingdom (NEK) of Vermont, recognize NationalRecovery Month, a time to celebrate the millions of Americans who are inrecovery from mental health and/or substance use disorders—and torecommit to breaking down barriers to treatment.
This year’s theme, Recovery is REAL (Restoring Every Aspect of Life),highlights the truth that recovery goes far beyond abstinence. It’s aboutrestoring health, a sense of purpose and overall wellbeing. But achievingthese goals often depends on one critical factor: access to recovery services.
Why Integrating Recovery Services into Primary Care MattersRecovery begins with hope and the conviction that healing and change arepossible. Building on an individual’s strengths, readiness, and availableresources; recovery is a holistic process that extends beyond symptommanagement to encompass the whole person.
For nearly 20 years, Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC) has embracedholistic, patient-centered care through the integration of mental health andsubstance use (behavioral health) services within their Primary Carepractices throughout Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. Because of this,NCHC’s Primary Care practices provide not only a medical entry point, butalso a cornerstone of recovery. NCHC’s Primary Care providers are often thefirst and most consistent point of contact, ensuring whole-person care thatintegrates physical health, mental health, social health, and substance usesupport.
“I have heard for years, and from many patients, that it is reassuring toknow that we see them and care for them as entire beings, and not just aspatients with substance use disorder. And that it makes it comfortable andconvenient to receive all services in one place,” says Jeri Wohlberg, FamilyNurse Practitioner at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC’s AssistantMedical Director.
Jeri Wohlberg, Family Nurse Practitioner at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC’s Assistant Medical Director; and Brook
Marcotte, RN at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC MOUD Program Coordinator discussing recovery with a patient.
“This program and the ones (who) run it, saved my life. I’ve never felt socomfortable with a medical team before,” said a patient in recovery fromsubstance use disorder (SUD) with NCHC’s Hardwick Area Health Center.
Substance Use Disorder (SUD)A substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic but treatable medical condition.It occurs when someone continues using alcohol, drugs, or other substancesdespite harmful effects on their health, relationships, or daily life.
In 2022, more than 1 in 6 Americans aged 12 and older reported having aSUD. SUDs can range from mild to severe and can affect anyone, regardlessof race, gender, income, or background.
Substances linked to SUDs include:

 Alcohol
 Cannabis
 Hallucinogens
 Inhalants
 Opioids (prescription and illicit)
 Sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety drugs
 Stimulants (like cocaine or methamphetamine)
 Tobacco/nicotine

Substance use disorders can happen to anyone. Some people begin usingsubstances to cope with trauma, stress, or mental health conditions. Othersdevelop SUD after being prescribed opioids for pain. Over time, substanceuse can change the brain, creating strong cravings that drive continued use.
Treatment and RecoveryRecovery looks different for every person – there is no single “right way.” Forsome, recovery may include counseling, medical treatment including medication, or peer groups; for others, it may involve faith, family support, or self-care practices. Often, it’s a combination.
Because SUD is complex and requires a personalized approach, NCHCPrimary Care teams provide a variety of options for patients including accessto compassionate and specialized staff to address many key components ofrecovery:

Behavioral health care and counseling staff, including psychiatry, forsupport with related mental health needs, understanding triggers andbuilding coping skills, and encouraging patient participation inmeaningful daily activities—like work, school, caring for loved ones,volunteering, or exploring creative outlets.
Community Health Workers and Peer Support Workers to connectpatients and families to community resources (housing, food,transportation), facilitate access to social services, self-managementprograms and peer support groups, and provide guidance andencouragement.
Licensed medical Primary Care providers (Doctors, Nurse Practitioners,Physician Assistants) to maintain a schedule of ongoing checkups andtreatment. Many are trained to prescribe medications that reducecravings or ease withdrawal like those used for Medication for OpioidUse Disorder (MOUD) (formerly known as Mediation AssistedTreatment or MAT), or to provide referrals to specialized care when itisn’t available right in the practice.
MOUD specialists to coordinate medical care, use of medications,counseling and behavioral therapies, and support services to provide awhole-patient approach to the treatment of opioid use disorder.

Reducing StigmaPeople with SUDs often struggle to stop using substances, even when theyunderstand the risks, and even when services like those at NCHC PrimaryCare practices are available. Overcoming SUD almost always requires morethan “willpower.”
Addiction stigma, the negative and unfair belief that those who developSUDs are morally weak and that they should “just quit,” often keeps peoplefrom seeking help. Over time, stigma may become internalized and leadpeople to believe that they are of lesser value or unworthy of help becausethey can’t tackle SUD on their own.
Understanding SUD as a health condition—and not a personal failure—canmake it easier for individuals and families to access life-saving treatmentand long-term recovery. This understanding and compassionateenvironment is one that NCHC Primary Care practices seek to cultivate.
“The research shows us that the biggest reason people don’t reach out forhelp with substance use is stigma, and anecdotally, this is what I hear frompatients. It is both heart-breaking and affirming when patients say, ‘I wish I’ddone this 20 years ago.’ We still have a long way to go, but when I hear that,I know that we have provided a safe space where people feel heard andsupported –and I know we’re on the right track,” says Brook Marcotte, RN atHardwick Area Health Center and NCHC MOUD Program Coordinator.
When this type of care is available, recovery is not only possible—it ishappening every day. “My MAT RN is amazing and is so helpful and kind,and I believe she actually cares about my recovery. She is always advocatingfor me, listens to me and helps me in any way that I need,” says a patient atNCHC’s Hardwick Area Health Center.

(Photo: NCGA livestream) Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall held a rare joint press conference Thursday to announce plans to bring forth a comprehensive package in September to address violent crimes. The two legislative leaders connected the August 22 murder of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail system with Wednesday’s assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University.
“I’ll start by acknowledging today being September 11th and the tragic time in our country 24 years ago,” said Hall. “Unfortunately, as we stand here today, another tragic time in our country with the murder of Charlie Kirk yesterday, and for us here in North Carolina coming on the heels of a tragedy on the Charlotte transit system with the murder of the Ukrainian refugee.”
Hall said while they are still in the “homework stage” of determining what happened in Zarutska’s case, it was clear to him that it was largely the result of the judicial magistrate allowing the suspect, a repeat offender, to walk out of jail on the promise to reappear in court at a future date.
Michael Whatley, the Republicans’ presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2026, joined the press conference to honor Kirk’s legacy and find fault with former Gov. Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for Senate seat.
“There is a crime crisis here in North Carolina and across the country brought about by the left’s soft on crime policies. Roy Cooper has a history of being soft on crime,” said Whatley.
The former chair of the Republican National Committee said leaders in Democratic Party need to call out hateful rhetoric that is leading to violence.
Both Whatley and Berger pointed to the Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice (TREC), formed in 2020 by then-Gov. Cooper to address systemic racial bias in the criminal justice system.
Berger said that Zarutska’s life was tragically cut short because of the “atrocious policies pushed by out of touch politicians and court officials” that prioritize a “perverted vision” of equity and social justice.
TREC was tasked with submitting an annual report with legislative and municipal recommendations. It would be up to North Carolina’s legislature to decide which of those policies to advance.
But Berger said such recommendations could be problematic.
“What they do is they reflect an attitude on policing, an attitude on how things ought to be taking place,  and those attitudes in many respects are the things that inform the kinds of decisions that were made by the magistrate in this case,” said Berger.
Restarting the death penalty 
When the House and Senate return on September 22nd, Republican leadership will propose a package of policies to address crime.
“We can start by ensuring that Governor Stein and other members of the executive branch cannot establish any future task forces like the one Roy Cooper created that advanced weak-on-crime policies that kept Iryna’s murderer on the streets,” said Berger.
Berger also pledged to personally look for ways to restart North Carolina’s death penalty.
“Republicans in the General Assembly have attempted to restart the death penalty over the past decade and a half but those efforts have been stymied at every turn,” said the Senate leader.
There has been a de-facto moratorium on the death penalty in North Carolina for almost 20 years. President Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday that the suspect in the Charlotte case should be given a quick trial and the death penalty.
“There can be no other option,” Trump wrote.
Screengrab from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social Account on September 10, 2025.
Berger said legislators would also work to end cashless bail and keep repeat offenders in jail.
Speaker Hall said the forthcoming legislation would include more oversight of magistrates.
“Looking at the way that we select magistrates, making sure that the folks who are making these decisions are paying attention to what they’re doing and that they’re trying to serve public safety, not some left-wing interest,” Hall said.
Hall said the legislature would also examine the budgets of both Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to determine if any outside grants may have influenced magistrates to oppose cash bail. Advocate for bail reform have argued previously that cash bail disproportionately impacts the poor.
“Ultimately, we’re dealing with two local governments that in my opinion have lost institutional control of their areas,” said Hall.
Neither Berger nor Hall suggested that the new legislative package would include gun control.
“You know the murderer in Charlotte killed this young lady with a knife. A gun had nothing to do with it,” Hall told reporters. “Again, it’s a problem of local officials being soft on crime.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Speaker-Hall-09112025a-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

North Dakota and 11 other states are advocating for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the arguments of North Dakota ranchers in a dispute with an energy company.
WBI Energy used eminent domain to take a portion of the northwest North Dakota landowners’ property for a pipeline project in 2018. The ranchers were compensated for their land under a confidential settlement with WBI in 2021, though the parties disagreed as to whether the group was also entitled to legal fees.
A North Dakota federal judge initially ordered WBI to pay the landowners about $380,000 in legal expenses, though the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal overturned that decision earlier this year.
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

In early August, the landowners filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appellate court’s decision. They ultimately want the high court to reverse the circuit court’s ruling.
Twelve Republican-led states in a Monday friend-of-the-court brief took the landowners’ side.
Bob McNamara, the lead attorney representing the McKenzie County property owners, said it’s “remarkable” to see so many states come together in support of the ranchers’ petition.
The dispute centers on whether the parties have to follow federal or state law.
WBI took the ranchers’ land under a federal law called the Natural Gas Act, which allows private businesses to use the federal government’s eminent domain power for public natural gas infrastructure. While the landowners were paid for their land, the act doesn’t say whether that sum must also include landowners’ legal expenses.
Both the plaintiffs and the 12-state coalition that filed Monday’s brief take the stance that when federal law is silent, state property law governs.
Under North Dakota law, WBI is required to pay their attorney fees, the ranchers say.
WBI and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals disagree. The 8th Circuit in its ruling said that because  WBI wielded the federal government’s eminent domain power when it took the land, state law does not apply. When the federal government exercises eminent domain, it doesn’t have to cover property owners’ legal costs.
Allowing the appellate court’s ruling to stand would upset the balance of power between states and the federal government, the states argue in their Monday filing.
“Under the Eighth Circuit’s decision, landowners in seven states no longer have the benefit of state law property rights that landowners in the rest of the country have,” the brief says.
North Dakota landowners want to bring eminent domain case to US Supreme Court

The states expressed concern that the 8th Circuit’s legal interpretation could allow the federal government to quietly assume more regulatory authority over property-related matters.
WBI has to file a response to the landowners’ petition sometime in October, McNamara said. WBI declined a request for comment Thursday.
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to consider the petition sometime in November, he added.
It’s extremely rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to review a case, though the justices have shown an interest in eminent domain and property rights issues, McNamara said previously. 
He said the states’ brief could help put the case on the high court’s radar.
“The court listens to states when they say, ‘This creates a big federalism problem,’” McNamara said.
The 11 states that signed onto the brief with North Dakota are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)While union membership dips nationally, a new report by the Illinois Economic Policy Institute and Project for Middle Class Renewal at the University of Illinois says two states that have strengthened laws on collective bargaining rights in recent years are seeing union membership increase.
In 2022, Illinois voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting bargaining rights. Illinois reported its first non-pandemic increase in unionization since 2017, with 27,000 union members added in 2024, according to the report.
Michigan repealed its “right-to-work” law in 2023, and gained 15,000 members in 2024 after years of union membership decline, the report shows. Michigan’s action was the first reversal of a state “right-to-work” law in decades, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. With the change, unionized workplaces can now require union dues or fees as a condition of employment. 
As a key labor union pushes into the South, red states push back

States have been active in recent years when it comes to determining the balance of bargaining rights between workers and employers.
In February, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a ban on collective bargaining for public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, firefighters and transit workers. The law is considered among the most restrictive in the country. 
Labor advocates have since collected enough signatures to put a voter referendum on Utah’s 2026 ballot that could overturn the ban. 
In Wisconsin, a county judge ruled last December that a 2011 Republican-backed law banning collective bargaining for most public employees violated the state’s constitution. His decision is being appealed before the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.
Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington state this year expanded bargaining rights for agricultural cannabis workers and ferry workers and corrections workers. Maryland enacted a locally supported law giving bargaining rights to sheriff’s deputies in Calvert County, southeast of Washington, D.C..
Bills that would have expanded bargaining rights for public-sector workers in Nevada and Virginia were vetoed by Republican governors.
Adjusting for occupation, geography, education and demographics, union membership offered an average 8.5% boost in wages in the United States between 2022 and 2024, the report found.
Twenty-six states now have “right-to-work” laws, in which employees at a unionized workplace are not required to pay union dues even if they’re covered by the bargaining agreement. The Illinois researchers say such laws, along with a 2018 Supreme Court ruling barring mandatory union fees for public employees, are major drivers of declining union membership nationally.

,DC,2025-09-11 19:45:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump commemorates Charlie Kirk alongside 9/11 victims,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-commemorates-charlie-kirk-alongside-9/11-victims,,"WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump honored slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as he remembered the victims of Sept. 11 during a ceremony Thursday in Virginia, and announced he would posthumously award the popular figure the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Kirk, the late co-founder and head of the political advocacy organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking on a college campus in Utah.Trump described the attack as a “heinous assassination” and told a crowd gathered at the Pentagon that Kirk, 31, was “a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people.”“We miss him greatly. Yet I have no doubt that Charlie's voice and the courage he put into the hearts of countless people, especially young people, will live on,” Trump said.Trump said the ceremony to posthumously award Kirk the highest civilian honor has not yet been scheduled but that he expects “a very big crowd.”In recalling the deadliest attack on the United States, Trump said the “entire world came crashing down” for loved ones of the 2,977 victims.“In the quarter of a century since those acts of mass murder, 9/11 family members have felt the weight of missed birthdays and empty bedrooms, journals left unfinished and dreams left unfulfilled,” Trump said. “To every member that still feels a void every day of your lives, the First Lady and I unite with you in sorrow and today, as one nation, we renew our sacred vow that we will never forget September 11, 2001.”The president delivered remarks following Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who praised Kirk as a “good and faithful servant.” Hegseth said when faced with the tragic memory of 9/11 he finds hope in the “future of our great nation,” and invoked Kirk.“The young soldiers who take the oath give me hope. The young cops who wear the badge give me hope. The young firefighters who answer the call give me hope. The young agents who patrol our border give me hope. The life, example, and even death of Christ-follower and American patriot Charlie Kirk give me hope, sheer courage, no matter the arena,” Hegseth said.Vance in UtahVice President J.D. Vance, who had been scheduled to attend the 24th observance of 9/11 at Ground Zero in New York City, changed his travel plans to visit with Kirk’s family in Utah and fly with his casket to Arizona on Air Force Two, according to multiple media reports.Trump did not cancel a scheduled visit to a New York Yankees game Thursday night as part of a 9/11 commemoration.Vance issued a lengthy statement on social media Wednesday night sharing the story of his friendship with Kirk, including an acknowledgement they were both skeptical of Trump in 2016 before joining the president’s political agenda.“So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene. He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government,” Vance wrote.Kirk’s advocacy organization worked with Trump’s 2024 campaign to mobilize young voters in the November election.On Wednesday, Kirk was on the first of a 15-stop “American Comeback Tour” that was scheduled next week for events at Colorado State University.The zealous political figure was known for his outreach and events on college campuses. According to Turning Point USA, the organization has started over 1,000 chapters in high schools and 800 on college campuses across the U.S.Political violence Kirk’s killing is the latest in a string of politically motivated violence in recent years. A man fatally shot former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband in June. The alleged gunman, Vance Boelter, also shot and injured Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter had in his possession several weapons and a list of several Minnesota and federal lawmakers, including some of their home addresses, according to authorities.During last year’s presidential campaign, a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate Trump during an event in Pennsylvania. Just over two months later, another man attempted to shoot Trump at his golf course in Florida.In 2022, a man wielding a hammer and zip ties broke into then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and fractured the skull of Paul Pelosi, the Democratic leader’s husband.On Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of people stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. At least seven people died during or shortly after the attack and approximately 140 police officers were injured by the rioters.",,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s State Planning Council on Thursday approved a $10 billion blueprint for the next decade of transportation projects, even as questions linger over the availability of federal funding and the state’s ability to meet its own climate goals.
State officials must meet a Sept. 30 deadline to adopt the latest State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and send it to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for final approval or risk losing funding for future construction and rehabilitation projects.
“If y’all don’t approve this, starting Oct. 1, I can no longer approve reimbursements in Rhode Island,” warned Derek Torrey, Rhode Island administrator for the federal agency who sits on the council in an ex-officio role.
The State Planning Council is tasked by federal law with adopting a new STIP at least every four years. The STIP must present a four-year program, by year. Future projects are considered for informational purposes by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The project pipeline approved during the meeting held at the Department of Administration covers hundreds of projects for federal fiscal years 2026-2035, with 76% of capital spending being allocated toward the state’s roads and bridges. Notable projects include adding new lanes through the section of I-295 known as the “Cranston Canyon,” reconfiguring ramps near the state offices exit in Providence, and completing reconstruction of the new Route 6/10 interchange.
Even the rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge got listed as one of the notable line items in the draft STIP.
But just how many of those projects will remain fully funded over the course of the blueprint is unclear as spending authorized under the Biden-era Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is scheduled to sunset at the end of September 2026.
“We don’t know what comes next,” Torrey said. “We would all, I think, love it if the next transportation bill gives us more money, but we can’t plan for it. I certainly hope it comes in that direction.”
Meredith Brady, the council’s secretary and an associate director at the state’s Division of Planning, said she’s optimistic that Congress will reauthorize spending, despite “a new set of priorities coming out of Washington.”
“In the past when we’ve had a lot of political conflict, we’ve also had some extensions of the transportation authorization bill as it stands,” Brady said.

Short on state climate goals?
The STIP was approved by the council 19-1, with GrowSmart RI Executive Director Scott Wolf being the sole dissent.
Wolf commended the state for including “excellent individual projects” such as plans to replace bridges at Westerly’s Amtrak station starting in federal fiscal year 2029. But he called the overall project pipeline a “status quo roadmap” for Rhode Island’s future transportation priorities, noting that spending toward mass transit and bike infrastructure represents 12% of spending in the latest STIP.
“We need to move in a more transit and bike and ped-friendly direction,” Wolf said. “We need to reverse this serious underinvestment in non car-centric transportation projects.”
The Division of Planning first made the draft plan public in late June and then held two public hearings in North Kingstown and Providence along with two virtual sessions to gather feedback by July 30. Members of the public could also submit written comments online. Comments were compiled in a 255-page hearing report, many calling for greater investment in other modes of transportation.
“The advantages of alternative transit are well documented, including wellness, fitness, emotional health, reduced transit costs for riders, and reduced carbon emissions,” wrote Rep. Michelle McGaw, a Portsmouth Democrat.
Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat who sat in the audience of about a dozen people, most of them state employees, expressed concern that the lack of investment in alternative modes of transportation will hinder the state in meeting its Act on Climate goals. 
That’s the law passed in 2021 requiring the state to develop a plan to reduce all climate emissions from transportation, buildings and heating, and electricity to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-zero by 2050.
“If we’re not meeting those mandated benchmarks, we’re, as a state, liable,” she told the council. “People can sue us.”
The law allows citizens or organizations that believe the state is not upholding its responsibilities under the legislation to file suit in Rhode Island Superior Court starting in 2026.
Tasked with defending those lawsuits would be the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General. But Attorney General Peter Neronha hasn’t signed off on the latest project blueprint, according to a July 30 letter he sent to the council.
“As currently drafted, the STIP fails to take a forward-looking approach to achieving the State’s long-term goals, and falls far short of meaningfully furthering compliance with the Act on Climate,” Neronha wrote.
Brady said it’s not up to council to set policy.
“We’re just slotting the funding that we have into specific projects,” she said in an interview after the meeting. “And there are a lot of projects in the outyears that have the potential to positively impact our mode shift.”
Wolf wanted the council to amend the STIP to allow for additional investments but his suggestion was quickly rejected by other members of the panel after Brady stressed the need to get the STIP approved by the Federal Highway Administration before its Sept. 30 deadline. 
“First and foremost, we need to take action today,” she said.
Changes could always be made in the future, though they will require some sort of trade-off, Brady added.
“If you add a project, you need to remove a project or at least remove money from somewhere,” she said. “We can’t drop fiscal constraint.”

Kirk’s suspected killer remains at large and the manhunt continued on Thursday, with law enforcement announcing that they may have found the murder weapon – a high-powered, bolt-action rifle – in a wooded area where the shooter had fled. The FBI in Salt Lake City released two photos of a potential person of interest and asked for tips in helping apprehend the person.
After the shooting on Wednesday afternoon, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shared on social media that she was thinking of Kirk, his family and members of the community at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was killed. 
Before news of Kirk’s death, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) offered prayers for Kirk, his family and the students at Utah Valley University, emphasizing that political violence “has no place in our democracy.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) shared an article about Kirk’s death and stated “Political violence should be condemned by all decent people, no matter what your political leanings might be.”
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) also called for a stoppage in American political violence, calling it “wrong, anywhere, at any time, no matter what.

“This is horrifying. It’s tearing our country apart,” Dingell said.
U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) said in a social media post that “the political violence in this country has got to stop.”
In the same vein, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is running for U.S. Senate, said: “We all can have political disagreements, but violence is horrific and unacceptable.”
Calls for prayers, support for Kirk’s family abound
Following news of Kirk’s passing, several Michigan Republicans offered words in memorial of the 31-year old Turning Point USA founder.
U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) said Kirk “articulated conservative views to younger generations clearer than anyone.” 
“Solving political differences through violence has no place in our Nation, and these instances are becoming far too frequent. We must do better,” Bergman said. “Those of us who value free speech and conservative values vow to carry Charlie’s torch and pass it on for generations to come.”
Utah and federal law enforcement have yet to identify the shooter and their motive, but U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) said Kirk was martyred for his Christian conservative values. 
“Charlie was faithful even unto death – obedient to his convictions, bold in his witness, and steadfast in proclaiming the truth,” James said in a post to social media.
Michigan leaders warn of normalizing political violence
Alongside the state’s congressional delegation, several other Michigan leaders and candidates for office shared their thoughts on Kirk’s death. 
In a statement, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist said Wednesday’s shooting is another reminder that gun violence and politically-motivated violence, cannot be tolerated.
No matter who you voted for, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said there is no justification of violence of any kind. 
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

Michigan Republican Party Chair and State Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) said he and his wife were devastated to hear of Kirk’s death, praising his work with conservative student activists on college campuses. 
“The wave of political violence gripping our nation is un-American, and unpatriotic,” Runestad said. “No American should fear for their life because of their faith or their political views. I hope everyone in Michigan will join me in continuing to pray for Charlie’s family and the profound impact he had on our nation.”
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) issued a statement mourning Kirk’s death. 
“Charlie always emphasized that the minute we stop having discourse, the second we stop sharing ideas with each other, despite our differences, is when we will devolve into violence,” Nesbitt said.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is also running for U.S. Senate, said, “Even if we virulently disagree, we stand for free speech, and nowhere should free debate be more encouraged or protected than college campuses.”
Former Wayne County Health Director and Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate Abdul El-Sayed said that Kirk was practicing his right to free speech when he was shot. 
“Whatever our differences, we handle political disagreements with words and not violence in this country,” El-Sayed wrote in a post to social media. “That is the essence of what democracy is about.”
College political groups unify to condemn Kirk’s killing
Michigan College Democrats and Michigan College Republicans also issued a joint statement condemning the shooting. 
“Violence in any form has no space on our college campuses, end of story,” said Stella Camerlengo, president of the Michigan College Democrats. “As a generation, we have seen political violence plague Michigan and states across the country far too often. While our organizations may disagree on a lot, we can both come together to say that we vehemently refuse to accept a future where violence substitutes for dialogue.”
The two groups pointed to Wednesday’s shooting as a symptom of growing polarization in American politics, calling for disagreements to be sorted through loving, rational and good-faith debate.
“Terrorism has no place in American politics no matter what despicable way it manifests, and we will not be swayed.,” said Tyler Campbell, chair of the Michigan College Republicans. “We call all in our generation to sincerely learn from this tragedy, that we may preserve a united America.”

Phil Murphy signed a law Thursday that establishes a new cabinet-level New Jersey Department of Veterans Affairs, separating housing, health care, and other benefits for veterans and their families from an existing state department that also handled military readiness and National Guard operations.
The move comes after state officials paid millions to settle lawsuits over hundreds of pandemic deaths in state-run veterans homes. The deaths prompted both federal and state investigations, which led the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney’s Office to order reforms and expanded oversight for care they deemed so abysmal that it violated residents’ constitutional rights.
The law, which is set to take effect in 120 days, reorganizes the existing Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two entities — the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Military Affairs.
Murphy plans to nominate Vincent Solomeno, now a deputy commissioner in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and a former superintendent of the National Guard Training Center in Sea Girt, to be commissioner of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

(Getty Images)  LEXINGTON — The University of Kentucky has fired a tenured faculty member who formerly oversaw the university’s equine drug-testing lab. 
Scott Stanley was removed as the head of UK’s former Equine Analytical Chemistry Laboratory last year following an investigation that alleged the lab failed to meet standards under his leadership. The investigation was conducted by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, which oversees drug testing of Thoroughbred racehorses.
The UK Board of Trustees approved revoking Stanley’s tenure by voice vote during a Thursday special meeting. Trustees asked questions of Stanley’s attorney, Cristina Keith, and UK lawyer Whitney Stepp-Gay and publicly debated the decision. Stanley had waived his right to a hearing.
“At the University of Kentucky, we are committed to advancing Kentucky through research and service of the highest quality,” said board Chair Britt Brockman in a statement following the meeting. “We must uphold the highest ethical standards and comply fully with university and industry regulations. Any violations of these policies are taken seriously and addressed to maintain the integrity of this work – the work of thousands of people across this institution.”
Keith told the Lantern after the board vote that her client was obviously disappointed with the outcome, but she could not say if Stanley would appeal the decision in court without speaking to him first. 
A university press release said that terminating a tenured faculty member is rare, but allowed under Kentucky state law. 
UK began the process to revoke Stanley’s tenure last fall after initial findings in an internal audit. One finding included a test that was commissioned by the Horseracing Integrity and Welfare Unit was never performed but Stanley had reported the result. 
Keith said in the board meeting in response to questions about the testing result that “without additional information, Dr Stanley cannot speak to this specific allegation” and questioned the integrity of the finding. She said there has not been a photograph of the alleged unopened sample. 
“In addition to that, all samples are received in more than one vial, so assuming that there was a discovery of one unopened vial in the EACL lab refrigerator, that is not conclusive evidence that no testing had been performed,” she said. 
Charges Stanley faced, according to UK’s press release, were: 

Failure to perform duties: Misrepresentation, falsification of test results and fraudulent billing
Failure to perform duties and/or incompetence: Lack of internal controls (to prevent tampering and manipulation of data) and lack of oversight of EACL operations
Failure to perform duties and/or incompetence: Conflicts of interest/commitment and improper hiring practices

Frank Shoop, a nonvoting member of the board who is member and past chairman of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, spoke about the importance of accurate and credible drug testing for horse racing. According to the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, the thoroughbred industry brings in $115 million in tax revenue for the state annually. 
Shoop said a prominent testing facility used to be at the University of California-Davis. 
“A lot of people in this state worked a lot of years to get this to the University of Kentucky,” Shoop said.

Attorneys who asked a judge to make the Bureau of Land Management comply with an appeals court ruling announced that the federal agency has put off its plans to eliminate some herds until next summer.
The post ‘Checkerboard’ horse whiplash continues, southwestern Wyoming roundups now delayed until 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","The on-again, off-again and heavily litigated roundup and elimination of more than 3,000 free-roaming horses from about 2.1 million acres of southwestern Wyoming is looking increasingly unlikely in 2025. 
Over the course of the last few months, the Bureau of Land Management’s plans have been OK’d administratively, but then appealed, delayed and found to be illegal by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal agency wasn’t fully deterred, however, and had scheduled the roundups for Oct. 13, triggering a Friends of Animals lawsuit aimed at stopping BLM from proceeding.

This week, more plaintiffs joined the fray with yet another lawsuit, seeking to block the 2025 removal operations, which will eventually eliminate the Salt Wells Creek Herd, Great Divide Basin Herd and northwestern portion of the Adobe Town Herd. Those pro-horse groups and individuals — American Wild Horse Conservation, Animal Welfare Institute, Carol Walker and Kimerlee Curyl — sent word Thursday that the federal government informed them the BLM’s plans have changed. 
“Late yesterday afternoon we heard from the Justice Department, which represents BLM, that … the roundup is not happening this year,” Bill Eubanks, an attorney for the petitioners, told WyoFile on Thursday. “It won’t happen before summer of 2026. That’s all we know. It’s just a written assurance by counsel.” 
The next step in the legal process is a status conference in the U.S District Court for Wyoming scheduled for early October. Attorneys will convene to discuss potential remedies to a 2-year-old Resource Management Plan amendment that the appeals court found to be illegal. The court ruled that the BLM didn’t demonstrate how eliminating horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance,” which is required by the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. 
The ongoing dispute over the existence of the Salt Wells Creek, Great Divide Basin and Adobe Town herds goes back 15 years. In 2010, the Rock Springs Grazing Association revoked consent for the free-roaming horses to exist on its property within the 40-mile-wide swath of southern Wyoming where interchanging public-private land forms a checkerboard pattern.

This story by Randolph T. Holhut was first published in The Commons on Sept. 9, 2025.
EAST DUMMERSTON — Read and Malah Miller have been running the Dwight Miller Orchard for more than three decades. Their succession plan was to start passing the operation on to his children this apple season.
“This was going be a transition year for us,” said Malah Miller. “We didn’t expect it to be this way.”
A three-alarm fire on Aug. 16 destroyed the orchard’s packing house building that was home to their cold storage and produce coolers, their cider press and apple packing facilities, their retail area and their maple evaporator and sugaring equipment.
“Everything went up in this building,” said Read. “Everything except for the orchard is gone. This building was the brain, heart, and soul of all our functions.”
Also lost were 25,000 gallons of apple cider vinegar, 1,000 gallons of maple syrup and 400 quart jars of pickles that they had just finished making for this season. “You could hear the pickle jars exploding in the fire,” said Read.
But within days of the fire, Malah began making another batch of pickles.
“When life gives you cucumbers, you make pickles,” she said. “You have to keep moving.”
When a fire destroys your business, you find a way to move forward. For the Miller family, they have an orchard full of apples to harvest, and they are finding a way to use this disaster not to mark the end of an eight-generation Vermont farm, but as a new chapter in its long history.
Dividing up a big task
Standing in front of the ruins of the packing house three weeks after the fire, Read talked about how his family has divided up rebuild.
His children, Will and Martha, are busy with running the business and shaping what it will be in future years. Read said he is busy with the difficult task of dealing with the insurance companies and government regulators, cleaning up the debris and documenting the damage.
“It’s huge, the emergency stuff,” Read said. “There are tractor-trailer loads of steel that need to be removed. I have to document and come up with the replacement value for every bit of the building, its contents, and what it was used for. And all that has to be perfect.”
Read said the orchard’s insurance will cover most, but not all, of the losses.
As for operations in the short term, Read said that “we’re going to stick with doing what we are comfortable with doing.”
That starts with the organic orchard’s pick-your-own operation on Miller Road, which began on Sept. 6. It will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., throughout the autumn.
Apples will continue to show up at the Brattleboro Area Farmers Market, but it may be a while before the farm returns to making organic apple cider and apple cider vinegar.
Read said the family bought a complete cider making setup, which is expected to arrive at the farm this week.
The replacement for the destroyed packing building, which was built in 1962 by Read’s father, Dwight, using timber harvested from the family’s wood lots, will be constructed in a similar manner.
“We have a lot of resources here on the farm, and a lot of people who want to help us rebuild,” Read said. “We have the opportunity to stand on our forefathers’ shoulders to rebuild, but we will need the help of our neighbors to do so.”
Read said the family “has all been affected by the fire,” and the challenge is “finding ways to stay together and be positive. The most important job for us is to come together.”
Malah said that she and Read are making sure that the Miller children are being given “lots of room to make their own future.”
Gratitude for the help
The community stepped up for the Millers in a big way, donating nearly $97,000 to the orchard’s GoFundMe appeal that was started by Martha.
“That was the kids’ idea,” Read said. “Reaching out for help is something I’m not totally comfortable with, but I’m past the age to be embarrassed. But my father always said that when someone offers to help, it’s rude to not accept it.”
Assistance has also been offered by Green Mountain Orchards in Putney and other neighboring farms.
Read said the family is committed to keeping the community informed about the recovery process and will keep people up to date through social media.
And, next Aug. 16, Read said the family hopes to have a gathering to mark the first anniversary of the fire and the progress that the farm has made.
“We’re blown away by the support,” said Malah. “It has been very humbling, and I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying to pay all that support forward.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Democrats are calling for Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation to support efforts to compel the release of information related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The Democratic National Committee launched a digital ad campaign Wednesday calling for Iowans to contact U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and “demand they release the files,” showcasing photos of Epstein and President Donald Trump together as well as of a suggestive birthday card allegedly signed by Trump that was released by Democrats on the U.S. House Oversight Committee on X Monday.
Releasing the “Epstein files” has been a point of contention in Congress for some time. Before the U.S. House recessed in July, there was a bipartisan attempt to compel the U.S. Department of Justice to release government investigative documents on Epstein, who died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting federal sex trafficking charges. House Republican leaders successfully stopped attempts to force the House to vote on this effort.

Though there are some Republicans calling for the release of the “Epstein files,” much of the push has come from Democrats, especially following news that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump his name appeared multiple times in government documents related to Epstein as well as the publishing of purported birthday letters from Trump to Epstein.
The members of Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation said in July they support publicizing more information related to the Florida financier, but that they backed the Trump administration and DOJ approach to releasing information, saying Democrats were using the issue for political gain.
The DNC ad campaign is specifically targeting Miller-Meeks, who represents Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. The district, containing cities including Iowa City, Davenport and Burlington, is predicted by political forecasters to be one of the most contentious races in the 2026 midterm elections.
In a statement on the ad campaign, DNC Chair Ken Martin criticized Republicans in Congress for “covering” for Trump by not supporting efforts to release more information on Epstein.
“If House Republicans can’t even stand up for the victims and survivors of a notorious sexual predator, if they won’t even call out the president for a blatant government coverup, then how can their voters trust them?” Martin said.
Miller-Meeks said in July that she stands with Trump “in his efforts to ensure transparency into Jeffrey Epstein’s heinous crimes while protecting the victims who endured so much abuse.”
Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also called for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson to vote in support of the discharge petition to release files related to Epstein. Wahls and Hinson are both running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who announced earlier in September she will not seek reelection.
Wahls wrote that in light of the Democrat James Walkinshaw’s victory in the Virginia U.S. House special election who has signed or pledged to sign the discharge petition on the Epstein files” only one more representative’s support is needed to force a vote on issue. Wahls called on Hinson to join the four other House Republicans currently supporting the effort.
“Congresswoman Ashley Hinson is single-handedly blocking the release of the Epstein files,” Wahls said in a statement. “Instead of standing with survivors and the American people, she’s actively participating in a cover-up with Donald Trump and the rest of the D.C. swamp. Iowans deserve a Senator who will fight for transparency and accountability—not one who protects the powerful and hides the truth.”
Hinson has previously said she trusts Trump, Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel will “do the right thing” while pursuing justice and investigating Epstein.

The prescription is part of a standing order the health department announced on Thursday that is immediately effective and will remain so through of August of next year, unless withdrawn by Durham.
DOH Communications Director Robert Nott told Source NM the department recommends residents either print out a copy of the prescription or have it available on their phones when seeking the vaccine.
The standing order also follows updated protocols issued last week by the state Board of Pharmacy. Those protocols had emerged in response to an Aug. 29 public health order that directed the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
As Source NM previously reported, the Pharmacy Board protocol governs pharmacies’ distribution of vaccines. Previously, the protocol required the pharmacies to follow guidelines set by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. However, ACIP has yet to convene on current guidelines. In an interview with Source NM last week, NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said that lacking the ACIP guidelines, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
The revised protocol was intended to remove that problem. However, Nott said the department has “had some calls about pharmacists not understanding the order or still feeling like New Mexico residents need a prescription…With Dr. Miranda Durham’s signature on the prescription, you can use that as a prescription for a COVID [19] vaccine when you go to the pharmacy to eliminate any confusion about whether New Mexico residents need a prescription.”
A NMDOH news release notes that the standing order “addresses barriers that have prevented some New Mexicans from getting vaccinated. While most people could already receive vaccines through their providers, some pharmacists and healthcare providers were hesitant to vaccinate certain groups without formal prescription backup, particularly for off-label uses not specifically covered in FDA approvals.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but added new restrictions that make people over the age of 65 eligible, but requires younger people to have an underlying medical issue for eligibility. The state health department’s standing order allows off-label use by qualified providers — physicians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists holding an active and valid license in New Mexico — per professional guidelines and the health department’s recommendations. Those recommendations include providing vaccines “to any healthy person 2–64 years wishing protection.”
Thus the standing order “removes hesitation some providers had about vaccinating people who would benefit from the vaccine but fell outside the narrow FDA approval categories,” Durham said in a statement. “COVID-19 vaccines remain safe and effective tools for preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.”
In addition, the news release said, individuals enrolled in Medicaid will have the full cost of their COVID-19 vaccines covered.
The health department said anyone who is denied a COVID-19 vaccine should call the New Mexico Department of Health Helpline at 1-833-796-8773.
“We are clearing the way for New Mexicans who want the vaccine to get the vaccine,” NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “This standing order ensures that barriers don’t prevent people from protecting their health.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-12.40.55 PM-1024x700.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)In state legislatures around the country, medication abortion has emerged as the central focus of the fight over abortion rights. As Democratic lawmakers in blue states enact shield laws to protect abortion medication prescribers, their Republican counterparts — particularly in states that have banned abortion — are filing a flurry of bills to restrict access.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without total abortion bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Using medication to end a pregnancy requires taking two medications in succession: mifepristone to stop the pregnancy and misoprostol to induce contractions in the uterus to expel pregnancy tissue. These medications are also used by medical providers for other conditions, including to manage miscarriage and treat postpartum hemorrhage.
Research has shown medication abortion is effective and safe, with complications requiring hospitalization occurring in less than 0.3% of patients. Research also has shown medication abortion provided via telehealth is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Read on for an update on GOP-led state efforts to restrict access to abortion medication:
Reclassifying abortion pills as controlled substances
Last year, Louisiana — which has banned abortion — became the first state to pass a law reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled substances, in the same class as drugs such as  Xanax and Valium. Hospitals in the state have had to change how the drugs are stored, locking them in passcode protected containers outside of delivery rooms. Physicians in the state have said the new restrictions have interfered with or negatively impacted their treatment of patients.
Republican lawmakers in Kentucky, Missouri and Texas introduced similar legislation in their most recent legislative sessions, though all three bills died in committee.
More states are expected to follow Louisiana’s lead in the coming legislative session.
Banning and restricting telehealth abortions
While most abortions occur in person, telehealth is a growing provider. By the end of last year, 1 in 4 abortions was provided via telehealth, according to #WeCount, a national reporting effort by the Society of Family Planning, an abortion research organization.
About half of those were from providers practicing in states with shield laws who mailed abortion pills to people in states with telehealth restrictions, six-week abortion bans or total abortion bans.
Nine states currently have laws that explicitly ban telehealth-provided medication abortion, or ban the mailing of medication abortion drugs, according to KFF, a research and policy organization. Those are Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia.
Eight Democratic-led states have shield laws designed to protect providers who offer medication abortion via telehealth to patients across state lines: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
But GOP-led states are fighting back.
Lawmakers in at least 14 states have introduced bills to criminalize the purchase, prescription and distribution of medication abortion, according to Jennifer Driver, who tracks reproductive state policy for the State Innovation Exchange, an organization focused on passing progressive state legislation.
In July, 15 Republican attorneys general signed a letter urging Congress to ban such shield laws because, they said, the laws interfere with states’ ability to enforce their own criminal laws.
Allowing citizen lawsuits
This month, the Texas Legislature passed a first-of-its-kind bill that would allow Texans to sue physicians, manufacturers and others from outside the state who mail abortion medication into the state. It also bans the manufacturing of abortion drugs in Texas. It’s now headed to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it.
The law is expected to set up a legal fight over whether one state’s laws can be enforced in another state.
Meanwhile, a Louisiana law passed in June and dubbed the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” allows the mother of a fetus to sue out-of-state doctors and activists for performing or facilitating a medication abortion, and extends the window for such lawsuits from three years to five years.

Members of the House Select Committee on Voters Rights heard from Samantha Buckley, director of policy for the Secure Democracy Foundation. Her presentation made clear that Mississippi is far behind the curve on dealing with these three voting rights issues.
House Speaker Jason White has tasked the bipartisan panel — one of four select committees he formed to tackle complex issues before the next legislative session — to hold public hearings on the issues and craft legislation.
“Once again, the House’s legislative priorities will be clear and informed from the start as we maintain our focus and energy on preparing for the 2026 legislative session,” he wrote recently of the select committees.
In MS, 52,000 can’t vote because of nonviolent records
Buckley told lawmakers that 46 other states allow some sort of automatic restoration of voting rights for people convicted of crimes who have completed their sentences. Mississippi is one of only four states with a difficult application process for restoration, and given that only 207 people here had their rights restored from 1997 to 2004, it’s process may be the most restrictive. It requires lawmakers to pass by a two-thirds margin in each chamber an individual bill for each person’s rights to be restored, or a governor’s pardon.
The Mississippi Constitution drafted in 1890 in the Jim Crow era of racial discrimination listed 10 disenfranchising crimes — offenses that state leaders at the time believed Black people were more likely to commit. Since then, attorneys general interpretations added many more nonviolent, disenfranchising crimes.
Buckley said about 52,000 Mississippians, or about 2% of the voting age population, currently cannot vote because they have nonviolent felony records.

Buckley said many states provide for automatic restoration of rights after someone serves their sentence, fulfills their probation or parole, and-or makes financial restitution. She said making it automatic saves states money and reduces bureaucracy. But she said making such changes in Mississippi would most likely require a change in the state constitution, a heavier lift requiring a statewide vote rather than just lawmakers passing a law.
Rep. Noah Sanford, a Republican from Collins co-chairing the select committee, said he believes reform of felony suffrage restitution can pass the House. Rep. Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall and co-chair, said Speaker White’s focus on the issue with the select committee will help suffrage reform legislation’s chances.
“I think there is broad consensus among House members that restoration of voting rights for nonviolent offenders is the right thing to do,” Sanford said. “But we are not kings, and there are two other levels it has to go through (the Senate and governor).”
MS has had on-again, off-again ballot initiative rights
Mississippians’ right to place issues directly on a statewide ballot is, technically, enshrined in the state constitution.
Mississippians had the right to ballot initiative starting in 1914, but the state Supreme Court threw it out in 1922. Voters restored the right by passing a constitutional amendment in 1992, but the Supreme Court again nullified it on a technical issue in a lawsuit over voters passing a medical marijuana initiative in 2020.
The right to initiative in the state constitution includes requirements for gathering voter signatures from Mississippi’s five congressional districts. But in 2001, the state lost a district from population loss, and the court ruled the initiative inoperative. Since then, despite calls from voters and advocates to restore it, lawmakers have dickered over details and signature thresholds and failed to restore the right.
Buckley told lawmakers Thursday that the simplest way to restore the right would be to change constitutional language on signature gathering from five districts to four, or have language adapting to whatever number of districts the state has at the time of an initiative effort.
Buckley said 23 other states, plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands, have some sort of functioning ballot initiative process.
Lawmakers have debated how stringent the requirements for placing an issue directly before voters should be. Some fear sidestepping the state’s representative form of government could allow special interests with deep pockets to game the system. Others say the state’s previous requirements were too strict.

Buckley noted that, from 1992 until the high court ruling in 2021, Mississippi voters passed only three initiatives — one restricting eminent domain, one requiring voters to provide IDs and one (the court struck down) approving medical marijuana.
Mississippi’s ballot initiative in the past gave voters the right to change the state constitution. But lawmakers have also considered allowing it only for addressing state law.
Buckley said allowing it for state law might prove problematic because “when the public makes a decision, the Legislature could then change it back — what does that mean about the process?” She noted that states’ ballot initiative processes vary.
“No state really has a template,” she said. “Every state does it differently.”
Early voting faces uphill battle
Mississippi is one of three states — along with Alabama and New Hampshire — that does not allow in person early voting. In her presentation, she gave an example of the difficult process “Frank,” who would be out of town on Election Day, would have to go through to vote absentee beforehand in Mississippi.
Buckley said that in most states, in-person early voting “mimics most of Election Day practices.” She said it would reduce paperwork and clerical mistakes from Mississippi’s absentee voting process and mean shorter lines and less people walking away without voting on Election Day.
But early voting in Mississippi and other states has brought much debate, oftentimes partisan, with many Republican officials opposing it. Gov. Tate Reeves has been very vocal with his opposition to it.
Sanford said that of the three issues the committee is tackling, allowing early voting might face the most uphill battle.
“The governor remains opposed to early voting, and he’s made that extremely clear that it’s not subject to change,” Sanford said. “I’m not saying we are not going to work on early voting — compromise is the name of the game — but that may not be the focus as much as suffrage restoration and ballot initiative.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11114638/3X0A7482-1.jpg,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

Standardized test scores for Washington public school students improved slightly this year, according to data the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction released Wednesday.
But the scores remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and the test results show nearly a third of students are not meeting grade-level standards in math, while the same is true for about a quarter of students when it comes to English. 
There are stark disparities as well, with around half of the students in some racial and ethnic minority groups getting the lowest possible score on the math tests.

“We still have a ways to go,” Superintendent Chris Reykdal said during a press briefing. 
He added that growth in the test scores “is now not only exceeding the immediate post-pandemic struggles we had, but it’s at a faster trajectory of growth than even pre-pandemic.” 
Reykdal pointed out that across the U.S. and around the world, forces such as social media, economic stress, and the risk of violence in schools are posing obstacles for students. 
The state tests, administered each spring in grades three through eight and 10, are required by the federal government. They are designed to assess whether a student is on track for college-level learning without needing remedial courses.
The Smarter Balanced Assessment used by Washington and 11 other states scores students on a 1-to-4 scale based on their test results.
Federal requirements call for the state to report level 3 and 4 scores “as meeting the standard of being on track for college-level learning without needing remedial courses,” Katy Payne, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, said in an email yesterday. 
The data show that, overall, 50.9% of students are meeting this standard in English language arts and 40.7% in math. 
Last year, 50.3% of students scored a 3 or 4 on the English assessment, and 39.7% on the math tests. In the year before the pandemic, those figures were 59.6% for English and 48.9% for math.
Revised approach to interpreting scores
Payne said that in 2024, “after seeing how the state test score results were being mischaracterized across the nation,” Smarter Balanced, the vendor behind the tests, clarified that students who earn level 2 scores are also “demonstrating grade-level knowledge.”
OSPI now emphasizes that scores of 2 and up demonstrate “foundational grade-level knowledge and skills with a limited range of complexity.” 
Under this approach, the data shows that 70.9% of students are at or above grade level in English language arts and 63.3% of students are at or above grade level in math. 
Reykdal cautioned against equating low standardized test scores with failing academically in a subject, saying the tests are a point-in-time measurement intended to track trends.
He noted student data showing significant variability in their individual scores year-to-year as an example of why the standardized test isn’t a good measurement for an individual student’s success. 
“These assessments matter because it gives us important trend data for our state, and the more students assess, the better our accuracy,” Reykdal said. “But for any given student, gosh, if you had a bad day on a Thursday in May … you can get these kinds of results.” 
The trend data provided by the tests shows that Washington students are generally performing consistently with, or better than, their peers across the U.S., though Washington’s math scores have been steadily declining in relation to the performance of other states. 
Compared to the 11 other states that use the same assessment, last year’s test results show Washington ranked second overall in English and fourth in math.
The data also show that low-income students – defined as students who qualify for free or reduced lunch – consistently score lower than their higher-income peers. 
There are achievement gaps for several minority groups as well. For example, while 24.6% of white students scored only a 1 on the math assessment, the same was true for 47.6% of Black students, 53.9% of Native American students, and 56% of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students.
“There are student populations that need additional investment,” Reykdal said. 
“Those kinds of investments have moved the needle, which is great, but the gap is still very large,” he added. 
Legislative request focused on math
In an effort to improve Washington’s math scores, Reykdal said he plans to ask the Legislature for $10 million to fund professional learning for teachers, with a focus on those teaching kindergarten through eighth grade. 
“They’re not math majors, and they don’t need to be, but they need targeted instruction on how to move kids, particularly those who are behind in math,” he said. 
The funding would also be used to teach schools innovative models for learning math and to buy statewide licenses for some software tools that would be made available to elementary school students.

(Photo courtesy Heinrich’s office)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and other Senate Democrats are calling on the Forest Service chief to explain alleged discrepancies in his accounting for ongoing payouts of thousands of Forest Service employees who opted into early retirements or resignations earlier this year. 
The lawmakers’ Sept. 9 letter notes that Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz has identified two contradictory funding sources for accrued sick leave and vacation payments to roughly 5,000 Forest Service employees who opted into the Deferred Resignation Program during government-wide buyouts this spring. 
The Forest Service claims it’s fully staffed for a worsening fire season. Data shows otherwise

One of those funding sources, from an account typically used for forest research and local forestry, paid out more than federal Agriculture Department leaders said is necessary to cover the expenses. The other funding source imposes limits on the amount of spending for salaries, according to the letter.
“These significant discrepancies require clarification and accounting to Congress,” the senators wrote in the letter. Along with Heinrich, other signers included U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.) 
According to the letter, the resignations require at least $48 million this fiscal year for Forest Service employees. However, the senators are calling on the Forest Service to account for exactly how much early retirements and resignations programs cost taxpayers. 
The reduction in Forest Service employees, done at the urging of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” aimed to cut federal spending and occurred alongside widespread layoffs, including in New Mexico.

According to a spreadsheet Heinrich’s office provided to Source New Mexico, 372 Forest Service employees in New Mexico accepted the deferred resignation offer. They made up the vast majority of 500 New Mexico USDA employees who took the offer, according to the spreadsheet. 
In addition to the resignations, several dozen Forest Service employees were fired in New Mexico, though many were later re-hired. 
A spokesperson for the Forest Service did not immediately respond to Source New Mexico’s question about that number or a response to the senators’ letter. 
The letter gives the Forest Service until Sept. 22 to reply to nine questions about the funding and where it comes from, including why Schultz gave different answers about the funding source. It also seeks a detailed accounting of how much will be required to pay out salaries, expenses and accrued leave as of the day they stopped reporting to work.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heinrich.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Florida House photo by Meredith Geddings) Paul Renner, the Republican former Florida House speaker who has just launched a campaign for governor, lacks the backing of either President Donald Trump or Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Renner says it doesn’t matter — he still expects to win the GOP nomination by taking advantage of a deepening rift between DeSantis supporters and Trump loyalists ahead of the 2026 gubernatorial race and legislative session. Renner believes he may have the “unifying” message conservative voters are looking for.
“It looks like there may be a looming civil war, and I’m going to put Florida first. That’s going to be my approach,” Renner told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. “I think the race will look very different a year from now than it does today.”
Renner, 58, referred to the growing tension between Trump and DeSantis allies as they prepare for a reignited proxy battle between the two firebrands. Trump has backed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, while DeSantis has been elevating Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
This leaves Renner to seek a third lane to the governor’s mansion, without a substantial backer.
Political analyst Susan MacManus, professor emerita at the University of South Florida, said Renner’s success depends on his ability to drive media attention, rake in money, and whether his rivals implode.
“The key is, will the other two end up destroying each other and leave an avenue for someone like him? That’s really the only real strategy that he’s got right now,” MacManus told the Phoenix. 
Renner has roughly $1 million in his political committee account, compared to Donalds’ $22 million.
Collins, who has yet to announce a bid, has around $500,000 in his committee account and a reported net worth under $2 million.
Renner plans to emphasize his alignment with Trump’s MAGA agenda while defining his record as “inseparable” from DeSantis’s legacy, which was largely built when Renner served as House Speaker. 
He played a key role in passing controversial legislation that served as a springboard for DeSantis’s 2023 presidential campaign, including a first-in-the-nation crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; expanding the death penalty to child rapists; banning transgender therapies for minors; and a stringent six-week abortion ban.
Still, DeSantis has publicly refused to endorse Renner. 
Renner isn’t fazed.
“Once voters have the year that’s ahead of us to look at all the candidates, I do believe that I’ll be successful to become the Republican nominee, and then ultimately go on to beat whoever the Democrats put up,” the Jacksonville-area attorney said.
But that will be a tall task for the gubernatorial hopeful.

‘Ego and politics and pettiness’
Renner served as House speaker from 2022 through 2024 as DeSantis flexed an iron grasp over the Legislature. The period was marked by a sweeping Republican supermajority and very little pushback from within against DeSantis, partially due to Renner. DeSantis’ priorities easily slid through the Legislature to help construct the platform from which he would launch his presidential campaign.
Renner remains in lockstep with DeSantis on top issues facing Florida, including supporting mid-decade redistricting, signing a repeal of all vaccine mandates, and slicing or eliminating property taxes, he said.
That in-sync image Republicans constructed under Renner’s two-year tenure shattered when the new House speaker, Daniel Perez, a Miami Republican, asserted the House’s independence from the executive branch. Kicking off the latest era of Republican infighting, Perez attempted to stymie DeSantis throughout the 2025 session, encouraging House investigatory committees to comb through the finances of First Lady Casey DeSantis’s Hope Florida charity while criticizing the governor as “emotional.”
It marked the first time during DeSantis’ tenure that he presided over an openly defiant GOP-led Legislature.
Renner fears these open clashes are dangerous for the Republican Party — which has more than 1 million more registered voters than Democrats — and augur a larger battle within the GOP. Reflecting on his own speakership alongside then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, Renner revealed that although they had disagreed with DeSantis at times, they always worked it out privately.
“Through intermediaries, we talked about where we had differences, we worked through those, and then we came out in public, arm in arm. That’s why we were so successful,” Renner said, declining to specify what disagreements he had with the governor.
“I’m going to always put the mission and the goal of what Floridians need ahead of ego and politics and pettiness. I have no use for it,” he added.
‘You got to deliver wins’
Renner would be the first former House Speaker to become Florida governor in recent history, signaling that while legislative leaders wield significant influence during their tenure, building broader name recognition remains a tough obstacle to achieving higher office.
Polling from the conservative Tyson Group, helmed by former DeSantis pollster Ryan Tyson, shows Donalds with a commanding lead over Renner and Collins. That distance lengthens when voters are told about Donalds’ Trump endorsement.
Donalds’ 40% to Renner’s and Collins’ 2% apiece doesn’t mean much this long before the Aug. 2026 primary, Renner, a Navy veteran, argues. Historically, candidates previously thought to be surefire winners early in the race ended up losing.
“‘Bill McCollum’s going to be your next governor. Adam Putnam’s going to be your next governor. Little Marco Rubio from the speaker’s office is at 2%, like Paul Renner is — they’re never going to make it,’” he said, mimicking political operatives and drawing comparisons between himself and Marco Rubio, a former state House speaker who now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State and National Security Adviser.
“The people that counted Marco out — and many did — are the same voices that are saying look, this guy’s got money, he’s way ahead, he’s got an endorsement. And that’s just not what voters ultimately want,” Renner continued. 
He said voters want someone with proven wins and a record of having “run something” to lead the country’s third largest state.
“Everybody can talk in bumper stickers, and do interviews, and post on social media — and I’ll certainly do some of those things. But you got to deliver some results. You got to deliver wins,” he added.
The winner of the Republican primary will face off against the Democratic nominee for the governor’s race. The only prominent Democrat in the race so far is David Jolly, a former U.S. representative.

“The details of that will be (released) down the road, but we wanted to at least give you that much about mindset for him,” Kelley said in a press conference outside of the school Thursday.
Officials have identified the shooting suspect as 16-year-old Desmond Holly. Kelley did not name the two victims, but said their families plan to release photos and statements later on Thursday. Kelley said there is security present at the hospitals where they remain in critical condition. 
The suspect died on Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound he sustained after the shooting. The suspect’s family has been cooperative with authorities as they investigate and plan to search his home, phone and school locker, Kelley said. 
He used a revolver handgun that he repeatedly fired and reloaded, which Kelley said “went on and on.” As the shooting went on, he was unable to access areas of the school that had gone into lockdown. 
“He tried to find new targets, and he came up against a roadblock on many of those doors,” Kelley said. “He couldn’t get to those kids.”
Students and staff at the school “did their job, they did it well, and lives were saved yesterday because of the actions they took” during the lockdown, Kelley said. Many students ran and fled the scene while others remained locked down in the school. 
Kelley had no information on how the suspect obtained the weapon. 
Multiple agencies are supporting the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office in the investigation “because there’s so many crime scenes within the school and outside the school,” Kelley said. Many windows and lockers within the school were shot.
The high school will not reopen this week.

Read it here.
Los comedores populares, los refugios para personas sin hogar y los centros preescolares de California pueden seguir atendiendo a quienes no tienen estatus legal, al menos temporalmente, según una decisión tomada hoy por un juez de un tribunal de distrito de Estados Unidos en Rhode Island.
En julio, cuatro departamentos federales —Educación, Justicia, Salud y Servicios Humanos, y Trabajo— ordenaron a California que rechazara a muchos inmigrantes el acceso a servicios públicos financiados con fondos federales, como la atención médica, la educación y la capacitación laboral. Las nuevas normas se aplican a ciertas categorías de inmigrantes, tanto a quienes no tienen estatus legal como a quienes lo tienen, como los solicitantes de asilo o quienes tienen visas de estudiante.
California se unió rápidamente a otros 20 estados y al Distrito de Columbia en una demanda , argumentando que los cambios en las políticas eran ilegales. El fallo, que constituye una medida cautelar, significa que el gobierno federal no puede aplicar las nuevas políticas en estos estados hasta que se resuelva la demanda, cuya resolución podría tardar meses o años.

 “Con la decisión de hoy, programas vitales de educación, nutrición y salud como Head Start, y las familias que dependen de sus servicios, pueden respirar tranquilos”, declaró Nina Sheridan, portavoz de la Fiscalía General de California. Head Start ofrece educación preescolar gratuita a niños de bajos recursos en todo el estado.
 “La Administración Trump sigue poniendo trabas a las familias californianas que solo intentan sobrevivir, pero estamos contraatacando”, dijo. “Agradecemos que un Tribunal de Distrito haya puesto fin a esta cruel nueva directiva mientras continúa nuestro litigio”.
 Los cuatro departamentos federales declararon en julio que las nuevas políticas eran un esfuerzo por cumplir con una de las órdenes ejecutivas de Trump, que afirma que los beneficios públicos fomentan la inmigración ilegal. La orden ejecutiva exige a los departamentos federales garantizar que ningún beneficio financiado por los contribuyentes se destine a extranjeros no cualificados.
 Un abogado del Departamento de Justicia, Sean Skedzielewski, dijo que las nuevas políticas también reflejan la interpretación adecuada de la ley federal, a pesar del hecho de que el Departamento de Justicia ha utilizado una interpretación diferente durante casi 30 años.
 En su decisión escrita que emitió la orden judicial preliminar, la jueza federal de distrito Mary McElroy expresó su escepticismo ante el argumento legal de Skedzielewski. «El Gobierno (federal) argumenta que, de alguna manera, ha interpretado incorrectamente este estatuto durante los casi treinta años que lleva vigente. En su opinión, todos (de todas las administraciones anteriores) lo han malinterpretado desde el principio, al menos hasta el mes pasado, cuando el Gobierno (federal) comprendió claramente la forma correcta de interpretarlo».
 McElroy escribió que las nuevas políticas, que ahora están suspendidas, significarían que “menos personas recibirán recursos críticos contra la pobreza debido a que las comunidades inmigrantes evitan los servicios, pero también porque, en general, las personas que viven en la pobreza a veces carecen de identificación gubernamental”. 
 ¿Quién califica para recibir beneficios públicos?
 En 1996, el Congreso aprobó una ley que restringía la mayoría de los beneficios públicos financiados por el gobierno federal a los ciudadanos estadounidenses o a quienes tenían ciertos estatus legales, como la tarjeta de residencia permanente. Posteriormente, al aclarar la ley, el gobierno federal estableció ciertas excepciones.
 Cualquier persona, independientemente de su estatus legal, puede acceder a un centro de atención telefónica para crisis, y cualquier menor que haya sufrido abandono o abuso puede recibir asistencia pública, ya que estos servicios son “necesarios para la protección de la vida y la seguridad”, según la guía federal de 1996 , que aclaró el significado de la ley de ese año. Los albergues para personas sin hogar y víctimas de violencia doméstica, los hospitales públicos y los programas de apoyo a la salud mental o la recuperación del consumo de sustancias también están disponibles para todos.
 Como resultado de una decisión de la Corte Suprema de 1982, el gobierno federal permite que todos los estudiantes menores de 18 años, independientemente de su estatus legal, asistan a la escuela pública. Los inmigrantes sin estatus legal también pueden acceder a Head Start e inscribirse en clases de educación para adultos, que incluyen inglés como segundo idioma y programas de equivalencia de bachillerato.
 En el condado de Santa Clara, que abarca San José, aproximadamente el 40% de los residentes son nacidos en el extranjero y más de la mitad de los niños del condado tienen un padre nacido en el extranjero. El condado recibe alrededor de 3.700 millones de dólares en fondos federales cada año, la mayor parte de los cuales financia su sistema de hospitales públicos, según una declaración judicial de Greta Hanson, directora de operaciones del condado.
 Verificar el estatus legal de los pacientes no es factible, afirmó, pero incluso si lo fuera, “tendría consecuencias extremadamente perjudiciales y disuadiría a las personas de buscar la atención que tanto necesitan”. Si una persona tiene una enfermedad contagiosa pero evita buscar atención, por ejemplo, podría poner en peligro la salud de toda su comunidad.
 Aunque las nuevas políticas entraron en vigor en julio, el sistema de salud aún no ha rechazado a ningún paciente. Los estados en la demanda y los cuatro departamentos federales acordaron retrasar la aplicación de las nuevas políticas hasta el 11 de septiembre. Debido a la orden judicial preliminar de hoy, la promulgación de las políticas tardará meses o incluso años, y si el juez finalmente falla a favor de California, es posible que nunca entren en vigor.
 Esta es solo una de las muchas demandas que California ha presentado contra la administración Trump por el trato a los inmigrantes. En un intento por implementar una orden ejecutiva presidencial diferente, que exigía a los departamentos federales detener el despilfarro, el fraude y el abuso , el Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA) solicitó a California que compartiera datos privados sobre las personas que reciben cupones de alimentos.
 En julio, fiscales generales demócratas, incluido el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, demandaron al USDA, alegando que su objetivo es atacar a las familias de estatus migratorio mixto , donde los ciudadanos estadounidenses pueden tener un familiar extranjero. California también demandó a la Administración Trump por el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional después de que las redadas federales de inmigración provocaran protestas en Los Ángeles este verano.
 En total, California ha demandado o se ha unido a otros estados para demandar al gobierno federal aproximadamente 40 veces desde la toma de posesión del presidente. Durante el primer gobierno de Trump, California demandó al presidente 123 veces y ganó aproximadamente dos tercios de esos casos.
 Muchas de las demandas presentadas este año ya han dado lugar a medidas cautelares que han detenido temporalmente las nuevas políticas de la administración Trump, pero los defensores de los inmigrantes dicen que, no obstante, las acciones del presidente han tenido un impacto.
 Muchos californianos, incluyendo aquellos con estatus legal, evitan los servicios públicos por miedo. Algunos tienen miedo incluso de salir de casa.
 En una escuela para adultos en Huntington Beach, el director Steve Curiel comentó que pocos inmigrantes asisten a clases de inglés este verano. Comentó que ha escuchado que otras escuelas del estado están observando la misma tendencia.

But the state Supreme Court was told Thursday that no change in the state’s 1891 Constitution is needed to allow charter schools under a law the Republican-controlled legislature approved in […],"The Kentucky Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Danville this week in Newlin Hall at Centre College's Norton Center for the Arts. Centre students and students from nearby schools observed the proceedings. (Administrative Office of the Courts)Voters might have thought they settled the question of charter schools in Kentucky last year when a “school choice” amendment failed in all 120 counties.
But the state Supreme Court was told Thursday that no change in the state’s 1891 Constitution is needed to allow charter schools under a law the Republican-controlled legislature approved in 2022.
Kentucky Solicitor General Matthew Kuhn said the charter school law does not violate the constitutional mandate to “provide for an efficient system of common schools” but would instead improve the system’s efficiency by expanding opportunities.
The charter school law “fits neatly in our tradition of common schools,” said Kuhn on behalf of Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman. “In our common school system, the status quo can never be good enough.”
Lawyers for an education advocacy group and two local school districts contended the charter school law fails several constitutional tests, including a requirement that tax-funded schools be overseen by elected boards accountable to voters.
Attorney Byron Leet, representing the Council for Better Education and the Jefferson County and Dayton Independent school boards, called the law “the latest attempt by the General Assembly to redirect public school money, public funds to schools operating outside the common school system without the approval of Kentucky’s voters as required by the Constitution.” 
The attorney general’s office is asking the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling by Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd who struck down the charter school law and enjoined its implementation in December 2023.
Shepherd wrote then that the “policy goals of the legislation are not at issue in this case” but that there “is no way to stretch the definition of ‘common schools’ so broadly that it would include such privately owned and operated schools that are exempt from the statutes and administrative regulations governing public school education.”
Kentucky Supreme Court
Defending the law, Kuhn said Shepherd in his ruling had misapplied the 1989 Supreme Court opinion in Rose v. Council for Better Education, the landmark ruling that paved the way for the Kentucky Education Reform Act.  
He said Shepherd’s ruling “treated Rose effectively as a straight jacket that prevents the legislature from meaningfully changing the common school system. Rose, however, requires the General Assembly to continually strive to improve on the status quo.” 
Also arguing in support of the charter school law was attorney Paul Salamanca, representing Gus La Fonatine who is seeking to open a charter school in Madison County under the 2022 law. 
‘Outside looking in’
In response to questions from the justices about charter schools being allowed to turn away students when their enrollment limit is reached, Salamanca said “that’s a good problem” because it’s a sign the school is filling a need. “And HB 9 (the charter school law) has a solution. You can start another school and another school. They can keep starting …  if that’s what people want.”
Both Kuhn and Salamanca told the court that 45 states have charter schools, including all the states bordering Kentucky, and praised their performance. They also likened charter schools to magnet schools in Louisville and Lexington that specialize in arts or academic rigor, saying charter schools would focus on serving at-risk youngsters who are not being well served in their current schools.
“Kentucky kids are really on the outside looking in on what has been a resounding success, especially in urban areas,” Kuhn said. “And so I really ask the court not to leave Kentucky kids on the outside looking in for this important educational development.”
Leet disputed the success of charter schools. “Let me just say there is nothing remotely resembling a consensus that charter schools are a wonderful thing. But frankly, I don’t think that’s the issue.” He said the questions before the court hinge on more than a century of legal precedent. 
A provision in the law allows school boards in districts with fewer than 7,500 students to veto charter schools. Justice Angela McCormick Bisig questioned whether the provision would create discrepancies in offerings available to students across the state.
Justice Michelle M. Keller in her questions focused on the potential harms from diverting money from existing schools into charter schools that “parents or the public at large who are actually paying the taxes have no control over. … We’re going to be paying the taxes through our property assessment tax we pay now, but we will have zero control over who administers the charter schools,” Keller said, in contrast to elected local boards who now oversee school districts. 
‘Million dollar question’
Justice Pamela Goodwine asked what she called the “million dollar question,” noting that since the charter school law was enacted and enjoined, the General Assembly had put on the ballot an amendment giving voters the opportunity to “empower the legislature to use public funds for charter schools.”
“Should that impact our decision, or should we just ignore the nearly two thirds of the voters who do not wish to have taxpayer funds used in this manner?” Goodwine asked.
Salamanca acknowledged that if voters had approved the amendment “we wouldn’t be here today.”
But he contended that charter schools as they would be governed and operated under the Kentucky law meet constitutional muster.
“The referendum asked whether the people of Kentucky supported the idea of the General Assembly appropriating money for schools outside the system of common schools. We are not outside the system of common schools.”
Goodwine drew a flutter of laughter when she said, “So did the legislature not know how to word the amendment on the ballot or were they trying to mislead the voters?”

Ron DeSantis linked the tragic events of that day 24 years ago with the killing of prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk, saying his fatal shooting displayed “some of the evil that’s lurking within.”
“That attack [on 9/11] was an exterior attack, with people who were emanating from foreign lands with a foreign ideology. And yesterday we saw the assassination of a young political leader, Charlie Kirk — who I knew, many of you probably knew — and you see some of the evil that’s lurking within,” DeSantis said.
He praised Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, for his ability to bring conservative viewpoints to college campuses, which he called “usually hostile terrain” for political conservatives, including himself.
The proper response to disagreeing with someone’s views is “not to shout or scream someone down. It’s not to create unrest so that the mob makes the event not happen. And it is certainly not that you kill somebody in order to silence them,” he said, as the crowd applauded.
“So, as we commemorate the lives we lost that day because of that terrorist attack, and as we recognize the evil that was present in this country as a result of this external force and this external ideology,” he continued, “let’s not now 24 years later succumb as a country to some of those forces inside our country who are really trying to upend what America is all about.”
DeSantis offered the remarks at Curlew Hills Memory Garden in Palm Harbor, a location close to where he grew up in Dunedin.
When speaking about the Al-Qaeda attacks, the governor recalled how that event changed the trajectory of his own life. If it had not occurred, he said, it was unlikely he would have become a Naval officer.
DeSantis enlisted in 2004 while in his second year at Harvard Law School and joined the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2006. He was awarded a Bronze Star for meritorious service and received at least 10 awards and decorations.
The governor gave tribute not just to the nearly 3,000 people in New York City, the Washington area, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, who died on Sept. 11, 2001, but to the tens of thousands of first responders who sacrificed their own health that day and weeks and months later at Ground Zero in New York City.

Giving tribute to the first responders
“There’s been many that have died in the years since as a result of what they did that day and in the ensuing days,” he said.
“There’s others — first responders — who are still suffering from very significant afflictions as a result of their service on that day. So, all in, you’re looking at way more than 3,000 people as a result of that terrorist attack on 9/11. And I know we’ve got some folks that have since relocated to Florida who are battling different types of illnesses as it relates to that day and their service after, and just know this day is a day to also thank them for what they did and just express sympathy for what they’re still going through, because it’s been very difficult for a lot of people and a lot of families.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 24,000 responders who worked at the site in Lower Manhattan or at the debris-sorting pile on Staten Island have developed cancer, and more than 8,000 responders and survivors have died.
Nearly 3,800 of those who died had cancer, although the C.D.C. does not track whether cancer was the cause of death or the death was caused by 9/11-related illness.
Shortly after the event, the governor’s office announced that in response to a directive from President Trump and in honor of Charlie Kirk’s memory, the flags of the U.S. and the state of Florida will be flown at half-staff at all local and state buildings, installations and grounds throughout the state until sunset this Sunday.

“We're just day-by-day trying to chip away the gaps in these really important wildlife corridors,” the Department of Fish & Wildlife’s land acquisition coordinator said.

As the chestnut-sided warbler flits about the quaking aspen trees under the shadow of Birdseye Mountain in Castleton, Vermonters can hunt, fish, trap, birdwatch and trek in perpetuity along the nearly 5,000 acres of land conserved by the state, thanks to a now-completed conservation plan, state officials say. 
After eight years, the Department of Fish & Wildlife finished drafting last month its long-term plan for the land in Castleton, comprising the Birdseye and Blueberry Hill Wildlife Management Areas, according to the department’s state and private lands biologist Travis Hart. Like a quilt, Hart said, the state aims to stitch together a “patchwork” of different habitats to ensure species diversity and connectivity through permanent conservation efforts. 
The wildlife management areas situated in the Taconic Mountains bring together a unique mixture of plant and animal species and landscape features, providing a “critical link for wildlife and ecological processes across Route 4” to the Green Mountain National Forest, said John Austin, director of wildlife for the department. 
Over the next 20 years, Hart said the department plans to manage 4% of the Castleton land for ephemeral young growth forests while actively promoting the development of old growth forests on 24% of the land. The state lost much of its old growth forest during European settlement and logging for agriculture in the 1800s, and now conservationists are taking varied approaches to grow back the old growth trees, knowing their work will not come to fruition for decades if not generations.
This is one of many conservation milestones in southern Vermont in recent months, guided by Fish & Wildlife’s Vermont Conservation Design, which plans out the landscape for ecological functions, said Robert Zaino, a natural community ecologist with the department.
The areas contribute to the state’s overall conservation goal outlined in Act 59, a 2023 law that aims to permanently conserve 30% of land in Vermont by 2030, said Rebecca Washburn, director of lands administration and recreation for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
The state had already conserved 27% of land as of last year, Washburn said. Looking to fill the 3% gap in the next five years, Washburn said that departments within the Agency of Natural Resources, alongside conservation groups and land acquisition partners, are looking to invest in tracts of land that promote species connectivity, biodiversity and ecological community resilience.

Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, the main sponsor of Act 59, said the legislative intent was to ensure that the range of nine biophysical regions in the state are all addressed through different conservation models, including improving biodiversity, engaging sustainable forestry and resource management and allowing some lands to grow wild without human interference. 
For Sheldon, Act 59 — the Community Resilience and Biodiversity Protection Act — was born out of a recognition that “we need to turn the ship in order to make sure we don’t miss opportunities to conserve all of our natural communities before it’s too late.”
Through Vermont Conservation Design’s statewide mapping tool, BioFinder, Zaino said the state identifies which forest blocks serve as the highest priority “stepping stones” that help species move across the regional landscape between the Berkshires in Massachusetts, the Adirondacks in New York, the White Mountains in New Hampshire and the Gaspé Peninsula across the national border in Quebec.
Vermont’s southern region has relatively little permanently conserved land other than the federal Green Mountain National Forest, Zaino said. The state’s work with conservation partners to acquire high-priority tracts for permanent conservation is an effort to “safeguarding places that we know have this very high ecological value into the future.”

Partners acquiring land for ‘connectivity pathways’  
One such effort the state and the Conservation Fund completed this summer focused on a patchwork of land in the Chateauguay Forest. 
In June, the state was awarded $2.9 million in federal Forest Legacy Program funds to purchase and manage five parcels, said Kate Sudhoff, land conservation program manager for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
This includes nearly 900 acres on Sable Mountain in Stockbridge, which will be added to the Les Newell Wildlife Management Area, and the Long Hill and Chase Corners parcels in Reading totalling nearly 800 acres that will be added to the Calvin Coolidge State Forest. Sudhoff said the state is still working to purchase two more conservation easement parcels in Bridgewater and Killington with the federal funding.
The three plots are situated within the state’s oldest regional conservation initiative, the Chateauguay No Town Conservation Project.

Will Duane, land acquisition coordinator for Fish & Wildlife, said the Sable Mountain, Long Hill and Chase Corners parcels are higher elevation areas that lead to a menagerie of biodiversity on the landscape. The three plots are also critical “puzzle pieces” to build out protected natural areas for species movement as the state manages the land for public recreation, wildlife habitat and as a working landscape, Duane said.  
“We’re creating these connectivity pathways and these corridors for species to move back and forth, and the Sable Mountain piece is in a huge critical core habitat block in Stockbridge right there in the heart of the Green Mountains,” Duane said.  
Sally Manikian, the New Hampshire and Vermont director of The Conservation Fund, said the “organizing force” behind permanently conserved tracts of land was expanding public access to outdoor recreation along the skinny and vulnerable corridor of the Appalachian Trail connecting the Green Mountain National Forest to the White Mountains.
Another state partner, the Trust for Public Land, has also made strides toward the state’s goals, permanently conserving 500 acres at the gateway of the Robert T. Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area near the Appalachian Trail in Wallingford in March.

Shelby Semmes, the Vermont and New Hampshire state director of the trust, said the group is in the early stages of acquiring three parcels totaling over 300 acres in Dorset, which is a part of a partnership with the Vermont Huts & Trails to create a long-distance mountain biking “Velomont” trail. 
The project on the Dorset ridgeline is particularly valuable, Semmes said, because half the land is located across the Rich Northern Harwood Forest and it will conserve habitat around the northeast’s largest cave and bat hibernation site — the Dorset Bat Cave. 
In the small rural town of Jamaica, the Northeast Wilderness Trust is taking a different approach to permanent land conservation. 
In August, the trust acquired an easement on 600 acres of land for the College Hill Wilderness Sanctuary near Stratton Mountain and the Green Mountain National Forest in Windham County, which will remain permanently conserved as a “forever wild,” Northeast Wilderness Trust President Jon Leibowitz said. 
“Forever-wild conservation is a commitment that people make to a particular piece of land where we allow nature to have the freedom to evolve in a way that it directs the ebb and flow of life rather than people managing or manipulating a forest,” Leibowitz said. 
Duane said that fragmentation across the landscape makes it more difficult for species to move about, so the work of the state and conservation groups is to strategically create throughways for wildlife. 
“We’re just day-by-day trying to chip away the gaps in these really important wildlife corridors,” Duane said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 18:25:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Homelessness rises in CT as federal funding remains in flux,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/ct-homelessness-point-in-time-count/,"There were 3,735 people living in shelters or outside in CT in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. That’s nearly a 10% increase.","A new report shows that Connecticut’s homeless population grew for the fourth year in a row from 2024 to 2025.
The state’s latest point-in-time count, which is an annual census of the homeless population, showed that there were 3,735 people living in shelters or outside in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. That’s nearly a 10% increase, which is a smaller rate increase than last year’s report.
“The overall trend from this year’s count shows that the inflow of people into the homeless response system is more than providers of shelter and services can keep up with,” said Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.
On Thursday, the National Alliance to End Homelessness and Women’s Development Corporation filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over restrictions on federal housing grants. 
HUD’s new funding allocation rules consider whether shelters are in jurisdictions with sanctuary protections for undocumented people and whether shelters provide services around harm reduction for drug use, and they take into account policies around serving transgender people. The rules have left some providers uncertain about whether they’d get the money they need to continue operations.
The lawsuit asks for a temporary restraining order on the rules, and the organizations said in a press release that the rules are “unconstitutional and unlawful.”
Connecticut gets about $95 million annually from the federal government for homelessness and housing stability.
“It’s a very fluid situation, but these are the dollars that keep people housed year after year across the state, and they’re critical. We’re watching it, and then we’re trying to figure out the best steps forward as a state,” Fox said of the HUD policies.
Late last month, HUD ordered all public housing authorities to conduct audits to determine the legal status of their residents, and in February, HUD Secretary Scott Turner ceased enforcement of the Equal Access Rule, which required HUD-funded programs and shelters to determine eligibility based on a person’s self-identified gender.
“It’s time to get rid of all the far-left gender ideology and get government out of the way of what the Lord established from the beginning when he created man in his own image — male and female,” Turner said during the announcement. He also said there was “more to come” to ensure taxpayer dollars were being spent appropriately.
The point-in-time report shows that Connecticut has a small population of unhoused people who identified as transgender or gender nonconforming — about 20. Research shows that the LGBTQ population is more likely to experience homelessness.
Most of the increase in the homeless population came from people who are living outside, in their cars or in places not meant for human habitation. That number jumped by 45% to more than 800 people.
The largest population was adults without children, and some of the notable increases were among the older population. There was a 20% increase in people ages 55-64 and a 33% increase in those 64 and older, according to the report.
Providers have said for months that they’ve seen an increasing population of seniors who are losing their housing because of rising rents.
“There’s been a massive spike in the amount of dollars that the agencies have to put in” to house people, said Jim Bombaci, vice president of operations at Nutmeg Consulting, the agency that created the report. “Every dollar more that they put to keep a person in a unit is a dollar less they have to house a new person.”
It’s also hard for people experiencing homelessness to find a place to live because of the lack of affordable housing in Connecticut, experts said, which means that people are staying in shelters longer.
As the number of people experiencing homelessness and the lengths of stays have risen, homelessness has become a point of more political focus in the past couple of years, with lawmakers and advocates asking for more money for homelessness services in the budget and the formation of the bipartisan Homelessness Caucus.
Just over 800 people who were in some type of shelter, living outside or in a supportive housing program, in 2025 were also in the system in 2024, showing that it can be difficult for people to obtain housing and to stay housed once they find a place, Bombaci said.
“We can start to identify these people and figure out who they are, why do they keep getting recounted in the same environment from one year to the next, what interventions are failing, what interventions are working?” Bombaci said.
The report notes that even though the number of shelter beds in the state has increased, there are still not enough to meet the need.
After concerted efforts from the state’s Department of Housing and the homelessness service provider system, the number of children without a place to live has dropped significantly, according to the report.
There were about 590 children experiencing homelessness in January, compared to about 680 in 2024, according to the report.
In the past year, the Department of Housing launched a Head Start on Housing program that pairs rental aid with access to early care and education. Fox said the program had helped cut down on the number of kids without a place to live.
“I think what this reflects is when investments are made, they work,” said Jessica Kubicki, chief initiative officer at the Housing Collective in Fairfield County. “The challenge is, these investments have to be made to scale to actually what the inflow is.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0202_SR_Unhoused_115-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

Read this story in English.
El mapa de el “gancho de langosta” del 5º Distrito sobrevive en un mapa recomendado por un perito judicial, adoptado por la Corte Suprema tras el Censo de 2020.
Estados Unidos asiste a una inusual carrera de redistribución de distritos, instigada a mediados de la década por un presidente ansioso por preservar la frágil mayoría de su partido en la Cámara de Representantes de EE. UU., en las elecciones intermedias del próximo año.
Texas rediseñó su mapa del Congreso con el objetivo declarado de elegir a cinco Republicanos más para el Congreso el próximo año. California está respondiendo con un esfuerzo para hacer lo mismo a favor de los Demócratas. Ahora, Missouri se está uniendo al Partido Republicano.
¿Dónde terminará esto?
Bueno, no en Connecticut.
Los Demócratas controlan dos tercios de los escaños en la Asamblea General y la oficina del Gobernador, pero no pueden dibujar unilateralmente mapas más favorables ni en los distritos congresionales, ni en los legislativos estatales. E incluso si pudieran, los Demócratas ya controlan los cinco escaños del Congreso.
Un efecto secundario de que Texas le entregará al presidente Donald J. Trump un mapa del Congreso a medida es un revuelo —bueno, más bien desinformación— en redes sociales sobre si el mapa Demócrata de Connecticut es producto de la misma política agresiva que vemos en Texas, California y Missouri.
Así funciona realmente la redistribución de distritos en Connecticut, cómo la delegación del Congreso pasó de 60% Republicano a 80% Demócrata en las elecciones intermedias de 2006, y por qué algunos creen ver un “gancho de langosta” en el mapa del Congreso.
¿Es la ausencia de Republicanos de Connecticut en el Congreso una prueba de manipulación de distritos electorales?
No, aunque el mapa del Congreso actual presenta fallas, si se compara con los principios de la redistribución de distritos, como hacer que un distrito sea lo más compacto posible. Y tiene poco sentido hoy en día, a menos que se entiendan sus orígenes y cómo se elaboró.
Pero no fue una manipulación de distritos electorales Demócrata. De hecho, inicialmente favoreció a los Republicanos.
La base del mapa actual son los cambios radicales impuestos por el Censo del 2000, cuando Connecticut perdió uno de sus seis escaños en la Cámara de Representantes de EE. UU. Desde entonces, solo ha sufrido ligeros ajustes tras los resultados de los censos de 2010 y 2020.
El Demócrata James Maloney de Danbury, quien representó al 5.º Distrito, y la Republicana Nancy Johnson de New Britain, quien representó al 6.º Distrito, que pronto desaparecería, terminaron en el mismo distrito en 2002.
El nuevo 5º Distrito se diseñó no tanto para servir a los intereses de los votantes sino a los de Maloney y Johnson. El objetivo era establecer una competencia justa, lo que requirió vaciar el otrora compacto 1er Distrito del Gran Hartford.
Johnson ganó en 2002. De hecho, los Republicanos ganaron tres de los cinco escaños en 2002 y 2004. Los Demócratas dieron la vuelta en el 5º y el 2º distrito en 2006, aprovechando la impopularidad de George W. Bush y la guerra en Irak.
Completaron la victoria en 2008, conquistando el 4º distrito en el condado de Fairfield, gracias al éxito de Barack Obama.
Johnson y Maloney hace tiempo que se alejaron de la política activa. La incómoda frontera entre el 1º y el 5º distrito —el gancho de langosta— persiste.
¿Por qué rara vez se dibujan los mapas del Congreso a mediados de la década?
El impulso suele ser igualar la población de los distritos congresionales tras la finalización de un censo en un decenio, y no reaccionar ante la posibilidad de que un partido pierda la Cámara de Representantes en las próximas elecciones.
Asignar escaños en el Congreso según la población es un juego de suma cero. El número de escaños en la Cámara de Representantes se mantiene constante en 435, y los tribunales han dictaminado que cada distrito debe tener aproximadamente la misma población, en la medida de lo posible.
Esto significa que el mayor crecimiento poblacional en los Estados del Sur y del Oeste desplazó el poder político. El Censo del 2000 dio como resultado que Arizona, Florida, Georgia y Texas obtuvieran dos escaños en la Cámara, y California, Colorado, Nevada y Carolina del Norte, uno.
Nueva York y Pensilvania perdieron dos. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Misisipi, Ohio, Oklahoma y Wisconsin perdieron uno.
¿Quién dibuja los mapas en Connecticut?
En algunos Estados, obtener el control de la legislatura significa que un partido se encarga de dibujar el mapa. No es así en Connecticut. La constitución estatal asigna la tarea a un comité legislativo de ocho personas con igual número de Republicanos y Demócratas en la Cámara y el Senado.
Si no llegan a un acuerdo sobre un mapa, los legisladores deben elegir a ocho miembros para una nueva comisión de redistribución de distritos. Esos ocho miembros deben entonces ponerse de acuerdo para elegir a un noveno miembro. Si esto no genera consenso, la tarea de trazar nuevos distritos recae en la Corte Suprema del Estado.
Cada 10 años, los legisladores tienen pocos problemas para negociar nuevos distritos legislativos estatales. Sin embargo, se han estancado en la realización de cambios al mapa del Congreso.
Como resultado, la revisión del mapa del Congreso después de los censos de 2010 y 2020 se delegó en la Corte Suprema y un perito judicial designado por el tribunal, quienes solo han realizado los cambios mínimos necesarios para igualar la población de los cinco distritos.
Justificación del tribunal: El mapa elaborado tras el Censo del 2000 fue imparcial, y corresponde a la Asamblea General realizar cambios más significativos.
Por cierto, el software cartográfico ha facilitado considerablemente el trazado de nuevos distritos.
Un trabajo en curso: Utilizando el software cartográfico Districtr.org, CT Mirror elaboró ​​un mapa del Congreso que conserva el equilibrio político del mapa actual, a la vez que elimina sus límites irregulares. Las cifras no reflejan los distritos actuales. Credit: CTMIRROR.ORG / CT Mirror
Si no son los mapas, ¿cómo se explican los resultados desiguales que favorecen a los Demócratas?
La respuesta son las cifras y las tendencias.
Primero, las cifras. Solo el 21 % de los votantes registrados son Republicanos, en comparación con el 36 % de Demócratas y el 42 % de no afiliados. Los suburbios adinerados que en un día fueron la base del Partido Republicano, especialmente en el condado de Fairfield, se han inclinado hacia el Partido Demócrata, al igual que algunos suburbios obreros se han inclinado hacia el Partido Republicano.
Esta tendencia se aceleró desde la elección de Trump.
Los Republicanos cayeron a su mínimo histórico en 2008, cuando la popularidad de Obama ayudó a los Demócratas a obtener mayorías de 114-37 en la Cámara de Representantes Estatal y de 24-12 en el Senado Estatal. El Partido Republicano fue ganando terreno de forma constante, quedándose a las puertas de la mayoría en la Cámara y ganando un empate de 18-18 en el Senado.
De hecho, al Partido Republicano le fue bien con Trump encabezando la votación en 2016, a pesar de que perdió estrepitosamente en el Estado: los Republicanos ganaron un empate de 18-18 en el Senado Estatal y se quedaron a cuatro escaños de la mayoría en la Cámara.
Pero todas las elecciones desde la victoria de Trump han sido un problema para los Republicanos. El mismo mapa legislativo que casi produjo la paridad en 2016 dio a los Demócratas amplias mayorías en 2018 y 2020.
La tendencia continuó con la versión elaborada tras el Censo de 2020.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-3.13.55-PM-1-1024x793.png,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

Currently, the state’s minimum wage is $14.65, but the Maine Department of Labor announced Thursday the 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The “tip wage,” or the minimum wage for service employees, will increase to $7.55 per hour. 
This is a slightly smaller jump than the 50 cent increase the state saw between 2024 and 2025. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, there was a 3.1% increase in the cost-of-living index between August 2024 and last month. 
For the first time, the state’s minimum wage will pertain to agricultural workers since Gov. Janet Mills signed a law in June that now guarantees them the right.
An estimated 35,000 workers in Maine were paid hourly and received less than $15 an hour in 2024, according to the Current Population Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The cities of Portland and Rockland have their own minimum wages, which are typically higher than the state’s. Both cities usually update their minimum wage based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, so their rate for 2025 is $15.50.
However, Portland City Council voted last month to place a question on the November ballot asking residents if they’d like to raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years. If approved, the rate would jump to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027, and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage would keep pace with cost of living increases.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday unanimously voted to consider an Advisory Opinion Request from a state lawmaker concerning candidate bank accounts. 
In a written request from Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, dated Sept. 9, the lawmaker asked the Commission to clarify a rule regarding bank accounts for candidate contribution holdings. The current rule, as he said he understands it, requires a candidate or officeholder to close their current bank account, open a new one and transfer carry-over funds with each new election cycle, even when running for reelection of the same office. 
“I have found the action to be cumbersome, be confusing, and possibly lead to the unintended consequence of observers being misled by the transfer of funds,” Strom wrote. 
The commission is expected to hear public feedback on a preliminary, written opinion at its Nov. 13 meeting. A draft of the opinion must be issued at least five days prior to the public hearing. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said several lawmakers have pointed to this rule as a point of confusion. 
Many officeholders seek reelection and run for office multiple election cycles in a row, she said. The question is can candidates have one bank account stay open, rather than open a new account and transfer campaign funds every election cycle, Bruce Boone said. 
“We definitely want to keep things transparent and accountable, but we also don’t want to miss the forest for the trees and make things so difficult, either,” she said.

The decision prompted swift rebuke from New Mexico’s congressional delegation and Attorney General Raúl Torrez, who noted in a statement that the New Mexico Constitution protects people from “racial profiling by state, county and municipal law enforcement.” A few days later, Source New Mexico sat down with Zoe Bowman, the managing attorney of the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center’s asylum and detention team, to talk about the recent decision and other issues facing immigrants in the state.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: How do you anticipate the SCOTUS ruling on racial profiling will impact New Mexico? 
Bowman: The ruling allows [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to use factors like the color of someone’s skin, the language they’re speaking, their accent, where they are working or just where they are in the community as a reason to arrest or to detain someone. It really emboldens ICE to be able to arrest and detain a lot more people.
We appreciate when our elected officials [take] a stance against collaboration with ICE, especially in cases where it’s unlawful under the New Mexico Constitution.
A new report from the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on Sept. 8 recommended DHS close all three of the state’s detention centers. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham left immigration detention off of the special session agenda, saying lawmakers wanted more time in the interim to address it in the January 2026 session. What’s your response?
We recognize this is an urgent issue, but we’re ready to move forward in January [and support] the Immigrant Safety Act [which passed the state Legislature’s House of Representatives in the most recent session].
We know that more and more New Mexico residents are being caught up in the web of ICE enforcement and detention. This issue is only getting more urgent, more important, as ICE continues to threaten the safety and well being of New Mexico communities. That pressure is going to translate for lawmakers in New Mexico and in the upcoming legislative session in January, and we’re feeling hopeful we can pass it this year.
What does NMILC consider an emerging threat in immigration and detention in New Mexico?
New Mexico has a majority of people of color. This Supreme Court decision not only threatens the rights and the safety of people who are undocumented, but is really expansive and opens up more people to ICE enforcement actions. We’re very concerned about that and believe that justice shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the language that you speak.
This decision weakens a core constitutional protection in the Fourth Amendment, that protects everyone from unreasonable searches and detentions. It weakens protection, not just for folks who are undocumented, but for all of us.

Raphael Warnock, pictured at a May town hall, is proposing a system of commissary coupons to help junior enlisted servicemembers access healthy meals more easily as part of Congress' annual defense bill. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderService members could have easier access to healthy meals under a bipartisan proposal introduced Thursday by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock.
The Commissary Healthy Options and servicemember Wellness Act – or the CHOW Act – introduced by Warnock and Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, creates a limited year-long pilot program to give junior enlisted servicemembers a monthly credit to use at on-base commissaries. The senators are hoping to incorporate it into the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which is expected to make its way through the Senate next week.
“For too long, service members have not had their dollars stretch far enough, and have lacked access to good, quality, nutritious food, which is basic,” Warnock said in a phone interview. “Our service members are the best among us. They shouldn’t be struggling with anything that resembles food insecurity. We need them to be ready and healthy and not have to resort to unhealthy alternatives.”
As proposed, the amendment directs the Department of Defense to administer the program starting at two bases, to be selected by the department. The bill instructs the department to choose the bases based on factors including low satisfaction with dining halls, large numbers of enlisted members living in barracks with access to kitchens and commissaries that are “experimenting with or expanding their selection of nutritious and minimally processed ready-made and easy-to-make food options.”
The amount of the coupons and other details will also be managed by the DOD.
Warnock said he’s hopeful the pilot will be a success and Congress will expand the program nationwide.
The effort comes after Warnock led an inquiry into the military’s spending on food and nutrition quality.
Commissaries are grocery stores on military installations that offer fresh food and packaged meals at a discount to service members and their families. Often, whether for convenience or cost, service members turn to fast food or snacks instead of more wholesome meals.
“Very often their allowance doesn’t go far enough,” Warnock said. “And let’s face it, we’re all witnessing this with the inflation that we are seeing, things cost more. Service members don’t live in a world that’s detached from the world that the rest of us live in. They live in that same world.”
A 2023 report by the American Security Project, a military think tank, found that about 70% of all active-duty service members are overweight, and 21% are obese, according to the Military Times.
Warnock said he hopes the new food benefit will boost morale and help increase readiness by ensuring troops are healthy and fit.
“How you eat impacts how you feel,” he said. “All of us have had those days – maybe not for lack of resources, it could simply be that you’re busy – when you’re not eating well, you’re just dragging through the day, and it’s because your nutrition is out of order. And we can ill afford to have that be the case for our service members.”
The U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the defense bill Wednesday with only 17 Democrats voting for it.

John Diehl, a former speaker of the Missouri House who was forced to resign in disgrace in 2015 when it was revealed he’d been sending sexually inappropriate text messages to an intern, pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal wire fraud charge. 
Diehl, a Republican from Town and Country, was released on his own recognizance Thursday pending a Dec. 19 sentencing hearing.
Federal prosecutors say Diehl admitted to applying for a loan through a federal program designed to help struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and using the money to make payments on a Tesla, an Audi and a Jeep, along with pool maintenance, country-club dues, mortgage bills and college tuition for a family member. 
All total, Diehl admitted to defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration out of $379,900.
Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine or both.  Diehl’s attorney said Thursday that his client has repaid the loan proceeds to the United States Treasury.
Diehl was arguably the state’s most powerful politician in 2015 when the Kansas City Star revealed he’d been sending sexually inappropriate messages to a 19-year-old House intern. While he initially refused to step down, he eventually resigned when it became clear he’d lost the support of key members of his party.
After his political career ended, he laid low for years before reemerging in 2018 to advocate for a company he co-owned that was hoping to mine cobalt in the Bootheel.
He later became embroiled in controversy in Independence, when the FBI began scrutinizing a contract to demolish the power plant in Missouri City owned by Independence Power & Light. Diehl was attorney for the company that won the contract despite bidding twice as much as the other company seeking the job.
A federal grand jury issued subpoenas to Independence to obtain a number of records related to the two utility deals, including minutes to private meetings held by the Independence City Council where the transactions were discussed. Additionally, numerous city officials were interviewed by federal law enforcement.
A Kansas City businessman named Joseph Campbell who was connected to the utility contract testified under oath that the FBI questioned him about Diehl, whom he accused of trying to create a fake attorney-client relationship in order to keep from having to hand over certain documents the government had requested through a subpoena.
Through an attorney, Diehl denied the accusation at the time. No criminal charges have been filed in connection to the Independence contracts.
In 2023, Diehl was fined $47,000 by the Missouri Ethics Commission for allegedly misusing campaign funds.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diehl-and-gavel-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-11 17:56:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,"‘A really good guess’: Jackson city officials, lacking confidence in the numbers, pass $337 million budget",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/11/a-really-good-guess-jackson-city-officials-lacking-confidence-in-the-numbers-pass-337-million-budget/,Jackson officials passed a level budget Wednesday while expressing uncertainty in the financial figures due to the city’s failure to maintain annual audits — something many cities and towns across Mississippi struggle to execute.,"A half hour into Jackson’s final budget meeting Wednesday, Councilmember Vernon Hartley wanted to know if — out of the hundreds of millions of dollars the city council was poised to pass in the annual budget — the city could allocate $2.5 million to blight control equipment. 
Pieter Teeuwissen, the chief administrative officer, leaned down from the dais to speak with one of his employees before offering a counter: That would work if Hartley dropped the number by a million. 
“No sir,” Hartley said.
Then Teeuwissen explained his hesitation: Like many officials in the council chambers, he lacked confidence in the accuracy of the city’s proposed budget book. 
“All this is numbers that none of us are willing to build our own financial houses on,” he said. “So I don’t want you allocating money beyond what my finance people say they are comfortable with.”
The uncertainty stems from the city’s failure to keep up with its audited financial statements — something many cities and towns across Mississippi struggle to execute. This concern led Mayor John Horhn’s administration to recommend the Jackson City Council adopt a generally flat budget this year. 
On Wednesday, the council passed the roughly $337 million budget, up from $325 million last year, Teeuwissen said, a difference that is due to the infusion of one-time funds, not substantial growth in the city’s general fund.

Hartley ended up dropping his proposal by a million as Teeuwissen asked. Other changes the council made to Horhn’s proposed budget included amendments from Councilman Kenneth Stokes to give a discretionary raise for the lowest-paid city employees and add an additional $1 million to the police and fire departments after the city completes the back-due audits. One proposal that failed would have forced the administration to pay the zoo’s water bills.
“We need to show some money in this budget that’s just not fluff, not just some money in the sky that ain’t there,” Stokes said. 
Council President Brian Grizzell said after the meeting that due to the late audits, the council does not know how much money the city has in its fund balance. He described his level of confidence in the budget he had just passed as “moderate” and added he hoped to have more time to look at the numbers next year. 
“We haven’t passed an audit since I’ve been in office,” Grizzell said. “It’s always just been a really good guess.” 
To remedy that, Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today the mayor also hopes to consolidate some of the city’s 11 departments starting Oct. 1, when the new budget takes effect. 
The administration said the mergers, which will include reducing the number of city employees, will help in the event that the budget changes once the city’s audited financial statements are complete. 
“The main thing Jacksonians need to know is that — I’m trying to choose my words carefully — the city, the administration has proposed to the council a flat budget in light of the lack of audited financial data,” Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today. “It is also likely that the city budget will have to decrease during the fiscal year as audited numbers are received now.” 
To complicate matters, the audited financial statements will not answer every question facing the city’s budget, Teeuwissen said.
Take, for instance, longrunning concerns about the impact Jackson’s dwindling population will have on its tax base. Officials do not know the extent to which Jackson is missing out on revenue due to potentially low property tax collection rates, even as the city property tax revenues grew by $2 million to $68 million this year, according to Fidelis Malembeka, the chief financial officer. 
“You might lose population, but somebody’s property values still increase,” Malembeka said after the meeting. 
Overall, the city’s revenues fell by about $8 million from last year to $316 million, Malembeka said, mainly due to a decline in one-time funding. Revenue generally includes permits and fees, sales tax, grants and non-recurring funding such as the Siemens settlement.
If the administration truly lacked confidence in the city’s budget figures, they would have taken more drastic action than proposing a level budget, said Tina Clay, a council member who represents northwest Jackson.
“If that was the case you need to freeze everything until you get the audit,” she told Mississippi Today.

Teeuwissen said the administration will be focusing on sensibly organizing city government, such as reinstituting monthly meetings with department-level fiscal officers, reviewing the finance department’s recordkeeping methods and moving services so they fall within the same department. 
“Right now, we do grass-cutting by contract, grass-cutting by community improvement and grass-cutting by Parks and Rec, and we’re supposed to have right-of-way maintenance by Public Works,” he said. “Three different departments and contractors all supposedly doing some version of the same thing but we really don’t have the left hand knowing what the right hand is doing.” 
The council on Tuesday passed a resolution supporting the mayor’s goal of consolidating and merging departments. Another way the city is attempting to coordinate efforts around infrastructure projects is an agreement approved Tuesday to share resources between the city and county, Clarion Ledger reported.
Parkinson told Mississippi Today he was relieved to know that the budget is not the end-all, be-all of the city’s spending power, as it can receive more revenue throughout the year in one-time payments, such as a $1 million grant the council accepted Tuesday from Jackson State University for beautification.

“I think there’s many people, myself being one of them, that says as much as we want to re-examine everything from the ground up, I don’t know if we can start with a blank sheet of paper in a couple of months and meet the deadline that we have legally,” Parkinson said. 
The city’s budget needed to be finalized before Sept. 15. Over the past week, council members heard budget requests from individual city departments. Some of the needs included helping the community improvement division tackle blight, such as streetlights that are out across the city, improving police technology and purchasing new patrol vehicles, and reopening the Sykes Community Center. 
But moves like that depend on coordination across the system — which, an exchange toward the end of the council meeting illustrated, is lacking in Jackson. 
In an effort to help the legal department, which was considering moving buildings due to HVAC issues, Foote proposed the city put an additional $1 million into the fund for the care and maintenance of public buildings. 
Then Foote learned from Sharon Thames, the deputy chief financial officer, that Jackson already has $710,000 for HVAC repairs set aside in a different fund, one that’s for the “repair and replacement” of city infrastructure. 
Thames explained the monies weren’t listed in the budget book where Foote had looked.
“I mean, this is crazy, people are packing up and getting ready to move when we have money in our budget,” Foote responded. “We’re not communicating well across the system if the money is there, and then we’re being told by the legal department they have to move out because the money to fix their HVAC isn’t there?”
“I mean, to kind of answer your question on the legal (department), that building belongs to JRA (Jackson Redevelopment Authority), not to the city of Jackson,” Thames said. 
“JRA belongs to the city of Jackson,” Foote shot back. Clay shook her head and other council members laughed. 
“Well, yeah, but they don’t like to share their money,” Thames quipped.
(JRA Director Christopher Pike told Mississippi Today Thursday that his agency, a partner to the city, deploys its funding on programming and building maintenance — it’s not as much a matter of not sharing as it is having limited resources — and that it stands ready to assist with these concerns).
Teeuwissen chimed in. 
“As a practical matter I’m with you,” he said to Foote. “If that money was available, that should have been clear so y’all could decide how to address the problem or how to proceed.”
“Somebody in the chain of command needs to know there’s $750,000,” Foote said. 
“Councilman Foote, there’s been no chain of command,” Teeuwissen responded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/26171057/Vernon-Hartley-Ward-5.jpg,,,2025-09-11 13:58:05.375406

,DC,2025-09-11 17:48:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump Education Department to divert grants from colleges serving students of color,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-education-department-divert-grants-colleges-serving-students-color,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education announced it will withhold $350 million of congressionally approved funds to minority-serving colleges and universities and divert the funds elsewhere, saying that the institutions’ admissions quotas are discriminatory.  The move eliminated fiscal 2025 discretionary funding for institutions that serve students who are Asian, Black, Indigenous and Hispanic, as well as a program for students of color pursuing careers in science and engineering. It’s consistent with President Donald Trump’s longstanding objective to eliminate programs that center on diversity, equity and inclusion.“To further our commitment to ending discrimination in all forms across federally supported programs, the Department will no longer award Minority-Serving Institution grants that discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.McMahon cited a July opinion from the U.S. Justice Department that it was unconstitutional for federal funds to go to Hispanic-serving institutions based on the student body makeup.That opinion reversed a decades-long record of the federal government setting aside funding for higher education institutions that have a significant portion of students from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds. The schools affected by Wednesday’s announcement are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; Black institutions; Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions; Native American-serving nontribal institutions; and institutions receiving Minority Science and Engineering Improvement grants. The announcement was vague about where the money would go instead, saying only it would be diverted “into programs that do not include discriminatory racial and ethnic quotas and that advance Administration priorities.”Up to 800 schools affectedDemocrats swiftly condemned the move, which is likely to face legal challenges.Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the ranking member on the U.S. House Education and Workforce Committee, said in a statement that the move undercut efforts to help students of color reach financial stability.“These institutions are effective engines of economic mobility because they meet students where they are and are dedicated to educating the whole person,” Scott said in a statement.Roughly 5 million students are enrolled in the more than 800 minority-serving institutions across the country. The schools aim to help students of color and students from low-income backgrounds pursue higher education. Most of the minority-serving schools receive funding based on racial quotas, except for Black institutions and tribal colleges, whose designations are based on their historical missions to educate Black or Native American students.The Department of Education will also reprogram funds from a program to develop Hispanic-serving institutions and from a program promoting postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans.McMahon argued that because most minority-serving institutions require that a percentage of the student body reflect the racial background the institutions serve, it violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protections. Administration cites equal protectionsMcMahon pointed to the Justice Department’s July memo saying it would not defend a suit brought by the state of Tennessee against Hispanic-serving institutions. The Supreme Court has explained that ‘[o]utright racial balancing’ is ‘patently unconstitutional,’” U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson. “And its precedents make clear that the government lacks any legitimate interest in differentiating among universities based on whether ‘a specified number of seats in each class’ are occupied by ‘individuals from the preferred ethnic groups,’” Sauer wrote.The U.S. Supreme Court case that Sauer cited in his letter to Johnson is the 2023 decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions that found two prominent universities’ consideration of race in acceptances violated the U.S. Constitution.Most minority-serving institutions, about 70%, are Hispanic-serving institutions, according to Rutgers University’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions.David Mendez, the head of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, an advocacy group, said in a statement that the loss in funding is “an attack on equity in higher education.”“Cutting this funding strips away critical investments in under-resourced and first-generation students and will destabilize colleges in 29 states,” Mendez said. “The funds granted to HSIs have never supported only Latino students. These funds strengthen entire campuses, creating opportunities and resources that benefit all students, especially those pursuing (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, as well as enhancing the communities where these colleges and universities are located.”",,,,2025-09-11 13:58:05.375406

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Energy overcharged state agencies by $2 million on 2024 energy bills — more than double initial estimates —  according to a new state audit published on Sept. 5. 
The 13-page report by Andrew Manca, chief of internal audits with the Rhode Island Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity comes as state utility regulators deepen their own review of potentially more widespread billing errors by Rhode Island Energy.
“At this point, one of my concerns is that we don’t fully understand what the problem was, or how many people it affects,” Todd Bianco, chief economic and policy analyst for the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC), said in an interview Thursday. 
Flooded by customer complaints alleging artificially high winter energy bills, including from state government administrators, the PUC in May ordered Rhode Island Energy to  hire a consultant to probe for evidence of billing inaccuracies. Last week, the PUC authorized a contract with Virginia-based professional services firm Guidehouse, Inc.  — one of three firms to respond to Rhode Island Energy’s request for proposals. An initial kickoff meeting between parties was held Wednesday, Bianco said.
The cost of the Guidehouse contract has not been made public.
Under state regulators’ directives, Guidehouse has until Nov. 15 to report results of its own audit into Rhode Island Energy’s billing practices. Manca’s report, which exclusively covers the 2,250 Rhode Island Energy electric and gas accounts held by the state government, will be incorporated into Guidehouse’s review of other commercial and residential customers.
And if the state review is any indicator, the problem may be more pervasive than anticipated. In July, state auditors identified overcharges of roughly $1 million. The deeper dive revealed state agencies were actually overbilled by over $2 million, according to the audit report.
The primary cause identified by the state was the transition from a legacy billing system inherited when PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, bought the state’s electric and gas operations from National Grid in 2022. 
During the transition to a new billing software, bills from August through October 2024 failed to credit the state for excess renewable electricity it generated. Under the typical net metering bill practice, customers with solar panels, wind turbines or other renewable energy systems receive future bill credits for any energy they produce beyond what they personally use, and return to the electric grid. 
Overcharges to Rhode Island state government have been mostly rectified, with the state using the credits toward its regular, monthly bills.  Payments on gas and electric bills resumed in June and August, respectively, according to Manca’s report.
A single state gas account remains outstanding, having not been identified for overcharges in the data initially provided by Rhode Island Energy, Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, confirmed via email Thursday.
‘Most unique customer’
Rhode Island Energy did not dispute the findings.
“Rhode Island Energy has been transparent and cooperative throughout the State’s audit process,” Michael Dalo, a spokesperson, said in a statement Thursday. “The State of Rhode Island is our largest and most unique customer, with over 2,000 bills from separate state entities consolidated into one. The timing issues identified through this audit were primarily the result of system changes during our transition from National Grid’s legacy platforms. We have addressed these issues, implemented corrective actions, and continue to strengthen our billing systems and processes. We remain committed to accuracy, accountability, and working closely with state partners to ensure reliable service.”
But the state audit doesn’t offer much reassurance that future errors won’t occur, or will be easily detected if they do. Manca highlighted the lack of automation and account mislabeling as systemic problems.
“The State of Rhode Island bears the burden of ensuring billing accuracy,” he concluded. These manual corrections introduce inefficiencies, increase administrative workload, and increase the potential for errors during invoicing.”
Bianco acknowledged that the state is a more complex customer than a typical household or business, with multiple buildings and accounts, along with separate, third-party suppliers for some of its energy. He was unsure whether the problems identified were isolated to the state, to large commercial accounts, or perhaps to net metering customers.
“There’s concern that the billing system did not perform, and other customers might have been impacted,” Bianco said.

The renewable energy wind project Revolution Wind was 80% complete when Trump halted its construction. 
On August 22, 2025, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order, citing national security concerns, although it did not identify any legal violation or threat to safety. At the time, all offshore foundations had been completed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines were installed.
The project began construction in Rhode Island in 2023 and was expected to start commercial operations next year, delivering enough electricity to power 350,000 homes in New England, according to Connecticut’s Department of Environmental Protection.
A DEEP preliminary analysis estimates a loss of the project could increase the cost of electricity for businesses and residents across New England by 5% to 7%.
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the development companies have sued the Trump administration over the wind farm stop-work order.

Kirk, a conservative activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed Wednesday while speaking at a university event in Orem, Utah. The search is still underway for the shooter.
During a floor session Thursday, the Wisconsin State Assembly held a moment of silence for Kirk as well as one to honor the 24th anniversary of 9/11.
“Mr. Kirk’s family are in our thoughts today,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. “We are still sad about the assassination of Representative Melissa Horton in Minnesota. Political violence and violence is never the answer — whether it’s the arson attack on Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home, the attempt on President Trump’s life or the university and college shootings that are happening all across our nation. Violence is never the answer.”
Hesselbein also acknowledged the shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado that happened Wednesday afternoon.
“This was another senseless act of political violence unfortunately against Charlie Kirk, and I want to express my deepest condolences to his loved ones,” Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said. “We all condemn political violence in the strongest possible terms. No one should fear for their lives because of their jobs.”
Security and safety concerns have been at the forefront of lawmakers’ minds this year, especially after the assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The names of several Wisconsin politicians were found on a list of targets belonging to the Minnesota shooting suspect.
“Given the recent rise in political violence, of course, this is top of mind for many of our colleagues, and of course, the staff who work in the Capitol as well as the press, the guests, the children that come through this building on Capitol visits,” Neubauer said. “It’s an ongoing conversation, and we hope to continue that with our Republican colleagues, who of course control the safety in our chambers, as well as the other entities in the Capitol.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said he is “very confident” in the Capitol police force and noted that many of the incidents that have occurred were not located in Capitol buildings. 
“When you look at Minnesota, it was in their homes. If you look at what happened yesterday to Charlie Kirk, it was in a public venue on campus, so the idea that we’re somehow going to fortify a single building to make people feel safer when the reality is that most of the violence that has occurred has not been inside of the buildings, but outside of people’s home.
In a video Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump condemned the assassination and listed acts of violence that have occurred against right-leaning figures, including the attempt on his own life last year, but neglected to mention the murder of the Hortmans. He blamed the incidents on “radical left political violence.” 
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” Trump said. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence.”
Asked about Trump only recognizing violence against conservatives, Vos said he didn’t see the comments. But Vos said he knows that in Trump’s “heart” he believes that “assassination is 100% of the time wrong.”
“When Melissa Hortman, who was clearly a liberal Democrat, I didn’t hear anybody on the right celebrating the fact that she was assassinated. It was awful, and that’s what it should be,” Vos said, adding that he condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death.
During the moment of silence, Vos said Kirk was a man “who represented free speech” and “was silenced in the most horrific way possible.” He said that the country is “rapidly deteriorating” as “many see the other party as their mortal enemies out to destroy the country, not just good-hearted political rivals that we should be.”
Wisconsin’s congressional delegation and other state leaders also condemned political violence on Wednesday, though one Republican has taken the route of blaming others for the violence. 
Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said that “there is no two ways about this: political violence has no place in America. I am keeping Charlie and his family in my thoughts in this truly horrifying moment.”
U.S. Rep. Tony Wied called Kirk “a true American Patriot” and said “his legacy will live on for generations to come.” 
“There is absolutely zero place for political violence in our country,” Wied said. 
“Violence against anyone because of their political beliefs is wrong. Violence against others is wrong.  Violence is never the answer for resolving our differences or disagreements,” Gov. Tony Evers said. “Wisconsin joins in praying for Charlie Kirk and the Utah Valley community and first responders.”
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, has been posting consistently since news broke about the assassination, blaming reporters and Democrats for the violence. 
“The left and their policies are leading America into a civil war. And they want it,” Van Orden wrote in one post. In another, he said reporters and Democrats were “directly culpable.” 
Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker said in a statement that Van Orden was encouraging violence. 
“His terrifying statements, which are inviting civil war and encouraging violence against Democrats and the media, are being completely ignored by Republicans in Wisconsin and in D.C.. They have a responsibility to tell Derrick Van Orden to stop pouring gasoline on an open flame, and I implore them to do so immediately,” Remiker said.
Remiker had already condemned the violence in a statement Wednesday, saying, “this sort of violence will continue until all of us, regardless of party, condemn these sorts of heinous actions.”

(Justin Haag/Nebraskaland Magazine, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN – John Ricks, the state tourism director who deployed the edgy and controversial marketing pitch “Nebraska. Honestly, it’s not for everyone,” has resigned.
Ricks, who was paid $133,838-a-year, could not immediately be reached for comment. His resignation was accepted Thursday by the State Tourism Commission, which has since appointed Deputy Director Heather Hogue as interim executive director, as was reported first by the Nebraska Rural Radio Network.
While Ricks got mixed reviews on the tourism pitch, an official with the Nebraska Travel Association said he played a key role in helping increase tourism in the state, citing a 26.4% growth rate in state lodging taxes from 2019-2022 compared to only 2.5% nationally.

“Ricks is to be commended for putting Nebraska on the tourism map,” said Kerri Rempp, president of the state travel association.
Hired in 2016 by then Gov. Pete Ricketts, Ricks had worked as an associate director in Colorado’s state tourism office before taking the Nebraska job. His hiring was touted as bringing a fresh perspective to a state that had been rated by one group as the “least likely” for tourists to visit.
That led to the new “Nebraska: Honestly, it’s not for everyone” marketing pitch, which included advertising emphasizing off-beat adventures in Nebraska, from floating down a river in a horse tank to hop-scotching across Badlands-like formations in Toadstool Park.
The self-deprecating pitch grabbed national attention, and, in 2022, won a national award for best integrated marketing and messaging. According to the State Tourism Commission, it also raised Nebraska’s tourism profile from last to 45th.
But some state leaders, including Gov. Jim Pillen and then Nebraska Department of Economic Development Director Tony Goins, disliked the motto, which was coined by a marketing firm from Colorado. Goins said it “made a mockery” of the DED’s pitchline for new residents: “The Good Life is Calling.”
By 2024, the “not for everyone” tagline was dropped by the Tourism Commission and state legislators passed a bill seeking to better coordinate marketing pitches between the independent commission, also known as “Visit Nebraska” and state economic development officials.
The Nebraska Travel Association, in a press release this week, urged the State Tourism Commission to “act swiftly” to replace Ricks.
The tourism agency is funded by lodging taxes paid on motel and hotel bills. Its budget this year is $10.1 million to promote an industry that generates $4.5 billion in spending annually and supports over 41,000 jobs throughout Nebraska.

Jim Lucas's switch to a ""HELL YES"" prompted a social media scuffle with a fellow Indiana House Republican lawmaker.","Rep. Jim Lucas visited the White House on Aug. 26, taking this selfie with a portrait of President Donald Trump at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally after an attempted assassination on the campaign trail. (Photo from Lucas' Facebook)One of Indiana’s first Republican lawmakers to declare opposition to mid-cycle redistricting is “now a rock solid HELL YES.”
Seymour Rep. Jim Lucas announced his reversal on Facebook and X just two weeks after he and his colleagues met with President Donald Trump’s administration on redistricting — and within hours of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Rep. Heath VanNatter, R-Kokomo. (From Indiana House Republicans)
Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census.
Lucas’ endorsement prompted criticism from Kokomo Rep. Heath VanNatter, a fellow member of the Indiana House’s GOP caucus.
“I knew you would fold,” VanNatter wrote. “Maybe you should keep your powder dry next time.”
Lucas replied that he “made a damn good case” against redistricting and “stand(s) by” his position at the time. He previously called the idea “highly unusual and politically optically horrible,” and pushed for electoral wins “the old-fashioned way.”
But after the D.C. trip and Kirk’s death, Lucas explained, “I have ZERO problem to publicly come out and explain my changed position.”
VanNatter responded by quoting Lucas’ own words — “hard no” and “dangerous precedent” — back at him, adding, “I assumed that meant that you opposed (mid-cycle redistricting) but I guess I don’t know what those words mean.”
He mocked Lucas’ phrasing and called the change “a real weird and quick flip flop.”
VanNatter hasn’t made his own position explicit, however.
Lucas didn’t respond. Instead, on Thursday morning, he posted a lengthy explanation of his reasoning to Facebook.
It wasn’t the killings of Kirk in Utah or a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, he wrote. Instead, it was his own back surgery.
Republican senators silent after closed-door redistricting caucus

Lucas lauded the Indiana Spine Hospital for being physician-owned and patient-focused at lower prices: “THIS is the way healthcare should be.”
If Democrats take control of the House, he wrote, “places like this might go under” and the rest of Trump’s reforms “will be dead in the water.”
“We owe it to ourselves and future generations to give Trump this reform possibility, because the status quo from both parties is destroying America,” Lucas concluded. “THAT is why I’m a hell yes on redistricting.”
Hoosier House Republicans met to discuss mid-cycle redistricting in mid-August and are set to meet again virtually on Friday. Their Senate counterparts caucused Wednesday.
Pro-redistricting texts sent by the conservative-leaning Forward America started going out again this week, even as a coalition of voting-rights advocates delivered a stack of nearly 9,000 signatures from anti-redistricting Hoosiers.
Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Braun has pointed out blue states with gerrymandered maps but has refused to take a firm stance on the topic. He is waiting for legislative leadership to indicate if a special session should be called.

(Image courtesy of the Environmental Protection Agency)While the state legislature passes laws on underground carbon sequestration, researchers are analyzing how lessons learned from wastewater injection-induced earthquakes could inform the growing carbon storage industry.


Researchers and companies in the U.S. are investigating ways to store huge amounts of carbon dioxide underground. The greenhouse gas contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, prompting some to develop technology to capture it and inject it into the earth.
A new article analyzing cases of induced seismicity in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and New Mexico, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, said carbon storage is critical to limiting the effects of climate change.
“But if it’s associated with induced seismicity, then I think it will really undermine public support for those activities,” said study author and Stanford University Professor Emeritus Mark Zoback.
The risk of triggering earthquakes by injecting carbon underground in certain geological formations has been known for decades, researchers say. Areas with hard and brittle rocks are more likely to be unsuitable for injection.
Zoback said he and co-author Peter Hennings, a research professor at the University of Texas, used wastewater injection as an analogy to explain what could happen with large-scale carbon storage. Captured carbon is converted into a supercritical fluid, which is similar to a liquid, for underground storage.
The paper analyzed some of Oklahoma’s series of earthquakes from the 2010s that were confirmed to be caused by oil and gas operations. Zoback said the affected area isn’t suitable for high amounts of carbon storage.
“ In north-central Oklahoma, one should not be doing large-scale carbon storage in the Arbuckle formation because we’ve done that experiment, we know what happens,” he said. “Now, that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to store CO2, for example, in depleted oil and gas reservoirs.”
At least two companies have submitted applications to store carbon underground in Oklahoma as of late August. CapturePoint withdrew its bid to operate carbon wells in Osage County in January after the Environmental Protection Agency indicated it needed more information about the site’s geology and potential for seismicity, a spokesperson for the company said.
Another company, NexGen Carbon Solutions, applied this summer to operate 10 carbon wells in Osage County. In an announcement, it said it planned to store 72 million tons of carbon over 20 years in the wells. The EPA application is currently in a technical review.
To welcome carbon companies, the state legislature passed a bill laying out rules for local regulation of carbon storage wells, known as Class VI under the EPA. At the time of passage, the state planned to ask the federal government for primacy to oversee and regulate its commercial wells.
“This is probably the most important piece of legislation you’ll see this year for future economic development in the state of Oklahoma,” bill co-author Rep. Ken Luttrell (R-Ponca City) said during a May 1 House floor session. “These companies are willing to come to Oklahoma and invest millions of dollars in our economy with these Class VI wells.”
Zoback and Hennings wrote that they want the research paper to serve as a guide for the public to understand the body of information on carbon storage and the risk of earthquakes. Zoback said public perception of underground carbon injection is key to putting away millions of tons of the greenhouse gas.
“ The biggest threat in many cases will not be the shaking of the ground, but will be undermining public confidence that it can go forward safely,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of NBC 12)Less than a month after opening for the new school year, two Virginia HBCUs —  Virginia State and Hampton Universities  — closed on Thursday after receiving threats to their campuses.
Though neither school has released details on what the threats entail, attention on campus safety has been heightened nationwide after the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.
In the past few years, Virginia’s institutions including Virginia State (VSU) and Hampton Universities have navigated multiple threats, some of which ended in no activity or followed after gun violence while others were found to be unsubstantiated.
“The safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors remain our highest priority,” Hampton University said in a statement Thursday morning, adding that further updates will be provided by the end of the day.
Hampton said in a statement that it received notice of a “potential threat” and has ceased all non-essential activities, effective immediately. All campus activities and classes would also be closed through Friday including athletic events and activities. 
Virginia State advised the school’s community to continue checking VSU emails for updates.
Last July, Hampton locked down the school to investigate a bomb threat targeting The William R. Harvey Library and the University Dining Hall, according to WAVY News. Officials determined there was no threat.
Then, a month later in Petersburg, Virginia State locked down its school after four people, none of whom were enrolled students, were shot on Boisseau Street outside Daniel Gymnasium on the university’s campus, 8News reported. The media outlet reported that all four people were then taken to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.
As of 12:30 p.m., no other institute in Virginia has announced any similar closure.
This is a developing story that will be updated.

Bob Menendez's wife Nadine was ordered to prison for 54 months for taking nearly $1 million in bribes for his political power.,"Sen. Bob Menendez takes a selfie with his wife, Nadine, and businessman Wael Hana. The three were co-defendants in an 18-count federal corruption indictment. (Courtesy of U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)Nadine Menendez was sentenced to four and a half years behind bars Thursday for her role in a yearslong international bribery scheme that landed her husband, former Sen. Bob Menendez, in a federal prison in June.
She cried as she told U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein during her sentencing hearing at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan federal courthouse in Manhattan that she blames her husband for her criminal troubles.
“I was wrong about my husband,” Menendez said in court, according to the New York Daily News. “I now know, he’s not my savior. He’s not the man I thought he was. I should have asked more questions. I should have known better.”
Prosecutors have portrayed Nadine Menendez, 58, as the greedy go-between in a global scheme in which she accepted bribes of cash, gold bars, a luxury car, and more from three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for her husband’s political influence. The plot began within weeks after the couple met in 2018 and continued until FBI agents raided their Englewood Cliffs home in 2022, prosecutors said.
“They were partners in crime, partners in corruption, and partners in greed,” prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said during the trial’s opening statements in March. “She did the dirty work.”
Stein agreed Nadine Menendez was not “an innocent observer” and sentenced her to 54 months of incarceration, offering some leniency because of the breast cancer that drove him last year to order separate trials for the couple.
She faced decades in prison after a jury convicted her in April of 15 crimes, including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, and conspiracy. Prosecutors wanted her incarcerated for at least seven years, while her defense attorneys sought a sentence of just one year, citing her cancer care and her traumatic childhood as a refugee whose family fled a civil war in Lebanon.
The former senator’s attorneys also played the blame-the-spouse game during his trial, when they portrayed him as an unwitting victim in a scheme orchestrated by his wife. He tried to backtrack that attack in a letter to the judge last month, when he said he “didn’t fully preview” his attorneys’ comments at trial.
“To suggest that Nadine was money hungry or in financial need, and therefore would solicit others for help, is simply wrong,” he wrote.
He implored Stein for leniency for his wife.
“Your Honor, you gave me a tough sentence that surely serves the deterrent value you said was needed,” he wrote. “To imprison Nadine, would not recognize the trauma she has suffered, how it has affected her and her judgment, and I would respectfully say would not have any greater deterrent effect.”
Bob Menendez was chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he was indicted in 2023. He became the first sitting senator ever convicted of acting as a foreign agent after a jury found him guilty in July 2024.
During his nine-week trial, prosecutors presented thousands of pages of documents, text messages, and photographs, and questioned dozens of witnesses to show how he acted to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar and worked to derail several criminal cases against the businessmen, in exchange for the bribes. During both trials, they offered as evidence text messages, voicemails, and other communications between the couple in which they discussed the scheme and riches.
Bob Menendez has appealed his conviction and remains incarcerated at the federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. A Democratic member of Congress for more than 30 years, he has unsuccessfully sought a pardon from President Donald Trump. He was sentenced to 11 years behind bars.
Two of the businessmen involved in the bribery scheme, halal meat exporter Wael Hana and real estate developer Fred Daibes, were also convicted and sent to prison for just over eight years and seven years, respectively.
Sentencing for the third businessman, Jose Uribe, is set for Oct. 9. He testified against his co-defendants in a cooperation deal with prosecutors.

A number of other gatherings are scheduled across Indian Country to commemorate the Day of Remembrance with vigils, prayers, and other events in museums, churches and local communities.
September is an important month on both sides of the U.S. border. September 30 is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada, known as Orange Shirt Day, in memory of the residential school students and the harsh conditions they endured. It became a national holiday after more than 1,000 unmarked graves were found at residential schools, including at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.
In the U.S., where thousands of Native children died in boarding schools, the National Day of Remembrance provides an opportunity for tribal leaders, survivors, descendants of survivors as well as congressional members and the public to come together to honor and recognize children who never returned home from the schools.
This year, the event coincides with the National Congress of American Indians Tribal Unity Impact Days, Sept. 16-18, also in Washington, D.C.
During the Impact Days,  NCAI organizes sessions in which tribal leaders can meet with members of Congress and federal agency officials in order to advocate for priorities such as fiscal year 2026 appropriations, public safety, economic development, housing, self-determination and other issues.
The Day of Remembrance also coincides with the fall session of the U.S. Congress, which convened on Sept. 2, giving lawmakers another opportunity to consider passing the Truth and Healing Commission on the Indian Boarding School Policies  Act (S.761). The act would establish a commission to investigate, document and report on the histories of Indian boarding schools, develop recommendations for federal efforts based on those findings and promote healing for survivors and descendants.
Although the bill passed  the Senate with a unanimous vote in December 2024, the House of Representatives did not bring the bill up for a vote before the legislative session ended.
In March, 2025, U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, and Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, reintroduced the bill. It is now awaiting further consideration and a full vote in the Senate.
At the event in Washington, a light reception and candlelight vigil will be held, and will include remarks from Deb Parker, the chief executive officer of NABS and a citizen of the Tulalip Tribe and descendant of the Yaqui and Apache tribes.

(File photo Maryland Matters)State Highway Administration officials “knowingly charged” nearly $360 million in unauthorized expenses to federal fund projects in an attempt to hide a deficit in the state’s Transportation Trust Fund, according to a new state audit.
The expenditures for more than 500 projects with $50,000 or more in expenses may not be recoverable. To cover the gap, the state may have to tap a $400 million Transportation Trust Fund balance or state general funds, according to the audit from the Office of Legislative Audits that was released to the public Thursday.
“More concerning is that the amount of unauthorized spending increased by 3,523 percent, including an additional $163.5 million between June 2024 and August 2025,” Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen wrote in his report.
Auditors reported a sharp increase of expenses carried as billable to the federal government, even though they had not yet been authorized.
“SHA also was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $449 million (which would include the aforementioned unauthorized expenses) or the subsequent recovery of the funds,” Tanen wrote. “To the extent that the federal funds are not available, Transportation Trust funds or State general funds, may be needed to cover any related deficits.”
Key Bridge deconstruction continues as officials eye initial effort for a new span

The audit looked at a four-year period between Nov. 1, 2020, and Oct. 31, 2024. Auditors said they looked at the period based on a complaint to the office’s fraud, waste and abuse hotline reporting a recent “rapid increase in the federal funds receivable balance.”
The findings supported the allegation in the complaint but “did not identify any matters that warranted” referral to the Office of the Attorney General for a criminal investigation.
Auditors reported a sharp increase of expenses carried as billable to the federal government even though they had not yet been authorized.
Between 2017 and 2020, the amount of unauthorized expenses  ranged between $7.7 million and about $10 million. But by June 2024, the amount had grown to more than $195 million. And in August 2025, the amount approached $360 million.
In one example, auditors found that the highway administration had fully spent $2.7 million in federal funds on an approved, unnamed project by September 2023. Even so, the agency charged an additional $3.1 million to the same project through August 2025.
Auditors noted that while the projects were authorized by the federal government, the amounts charged to them by SHA exceeded authorized federal aid.
Those additional charges, the auditors noted, “may not be recoverable.”
“According to agency management, SHA knowingly charged these costs as federal funds on the State’s accounting records to minimize the Transportation Trust Fund deficit,” auditors wrote. “Specifically, SHA management advised that they have sought additional federal funding when expenditures exceeded the federal grant and have attempted to find federal funds to cover more projects (including smaller projects that were traditionally funded through the Transportation Trust Fund).
“However … the federal granting agency has not authorized additional funding for these projects which will need to be funded with Transportation Trust Funds … or state funds,” the audit said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In their response, state transportation officials said it was “not factually accurate to say that projects were not authorized, but it is accurate that in some cases, expenses charged exceeded the initial authorized amounts.”
The agency said it works to determine if additional costs warrant modifications to its request for federal reimbursement.
“If the expenditure is deemed federally ineligible for reimbursement, it would be expensed to state funds,” the agency wrote in its response.
Auditors said they also found that in some cases, the highways administration “purposefully recorded” some “unbillable expenditures” as a federal receivable “without disclosing the unbillable nature of these funds.”
Transportation officials agreed with the findings and said it was working to “quantify any unrecoverable amounts and adjust account balances.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/highway-work-newsletter-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 12:57:56.888024

To accept what happened to Charlie Kirk as par for the course is to say that, in America, bullets are more important than ideas. Don’t take the bait, Rod Miller and Clair McFarland write.
The post Dying for speech can’t be the new normal appeared first on WyoFile .","Charlie Kirk was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at a college in Utah. There will be many details forthcoming, as the investigation into Kirk’s murder progresses. But make no mistake, Charlie Kirk was killed for speaking his mind.

Opinion

The footage circulating online shows Kirk uttering the words “gang violence” and then suffering what looks like a gunshot to the neck. 
Kirk’s style of engaging with young people is widely known and recognizable. Not quite a trademark, but he did it more actively than anyone else: the back-and-forth, the conversation, the debate. 
Sometimes that devolved into “the own.”
In America, we risk getting “owned” by a conservative (or liberal) influencer once in a while, when we teeter onto the beam of free speech. 
A little blushing, a little back-pedaling, and we’re on our way: embarrassed, but free to be embarrassed in the crossfire of ideas. 
It is this free exchange of ideas that flows from the First Amendment to our Constitution. Our national discourse has room for all points of view, even if those ideas are odious to some. Our guarantee to say what is on our mind makes each of us uniquely American, and to thwart that freedom with violence in the marketplace of ideas diminishes us all.
To accept what happened to Charlie Kirk as somehow par for the course is to say that, in America, violence is more powerful than words, that bullets are more important than ideas.
To say Kirk deserved to be shot for his point of view is reprehensible. 
But even as we recognize how reprehensible that notion is and feel it pucker places the Constitution doesn’t address, we can’t take the bait.
We can’t meet violence with violence. 
Let words be your sword. Let ideas be your honing stone. 
And if you can’t enter the debate because your ideas suck and you stumble over your words, just listen for a while. 
Consider the painstaking thought that formed our Constitution and its declarations of rights. Consider the forge that produced them. 
A convention. A meeting. 
A bunch of young bucks and their token old guy — Benjamin Franklin, the titan of outspokenness and the press’s true patron saint — swapping ideas. Not crossing swords. 
They made an America where words are mighty. 
We are both journalists. That means we belong to the only occupation whose freedom to operate is enshrined in the same First Amendment that guaranteed Charlie Kirk’s freedom of speech. The national cacophony of rhetoric erupting in reaction to Kirk’s murder is also protected by the First Amendment, even if some of it might make your skin crawl. 
But as journalists, our loyalties must lie with the Constitution and the freedoms that it guarantees, not with one side or another in this acrimonious debate. 
We fumble as a nation for something to help us rise above the murky political resentment and tribalism that grip our country and poison our thinking. 
For us, that something is our liberty as citizens of the United States to express ourselves freely. When anyone, for any reason, tries to negate that freedom through violence, we must speak up. 
And we must bridge our lesser differences to do so.

As Vermont faces deepening challenges, the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity (CVOEO) remains committed to its mission: ending poverty and building a future where everyone can thrive. In a year marked by uncertainty, community support has never mattered more.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  In crisis, community leads: CVOEO stands strong as ‘[...]","Federal policy changes are putting pressure on Vermont’s most vulnerable residents—and the nonprofits working to support them. At risk are the programs that form the backbone of survival for thousands of families, older adults, and people with disabilities.

“The proposed cuts don’t trim the fat off the budget—they sever the arteries of rural America,” said Paul Dragon, CVOEO Executive Director.

Among the most alarming developments:

The FY25 Budget Reconciliation Bill includes cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—stripping health coverage and food assistance from those who need it most.
The proposed FY26 Budget threatens to eliminate the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), along with other vital programs CVOEO administers.

For CVOEO, this means the potential loss of $1.2 million in CSBG funding, which directly supports hunger relief, housing and shelter, emergency assistance, and more across the Champlain Valley and beyond. These funds are not abstract line items—they are a lifeline.
“The proposed cuts don’t trim the fat off the budget—they sever the arteries of rural America,” said Paul Dragon, CVOEO Executive Director. “When CSBG and programs like LIHEAP and weatherization are eliminated, rural communities like ours are hit the hardest. These services are essential for older Vermonters, children, veterans, and people with disabilities.”
If passed, these cuts will gut vital community health, nutrition, fuel, and utility assistance programs—pushing millions into food insecurity, worsening health outcomes, and leaving homes cold during the winter months.
Despite these looming threats, CVOEO is not backing down. The organization is adapting, working harder, and digging deeper to continue meeting basic needs and empowering individuals to break the cycle of poverty.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, who is running as a Democrat in 2026 to lead the Michigan Department of State, this week surpassed 50 endorsements from a diverse coalition of community leaders, organizations and democracy advocates across the state.
A statement from his campaign for secretary of state said the support emphasized Edevbie’s credentials as he seeks to replace his boss, term-limited Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is seeking the Democratic Party nomination for governor.
It also shows the urgent need for a Benson successor with strong leadership and experience to maintain democratic values in Michigan, the campaign said.
“I am thrilled to have the support of over 50 leaders from across our state. The support we’ve earned shows our party and our state is ready to embrace fresh leadership from a black man with a different name,” Edevbie said in a statement. “As I travel around Michigan and meet with people from all walks of life, I hear a consistent message: people are alarmed by the current state of our democracy under the Trump administration, and they want a Secretary of State who knows how to fight for our democracy on day one. They want a leader who is ready to meet this moment. And I am prepared to do just that.”
On Tuesday, Edevbie added to his growing list of endorsements, which now includes state Rep. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) and state Rep. Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti).
Secretary of state candidates are nominated by their respective parties at conventions in the spring of each election year. Edevbie faces Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and former state Sen. Adam Hollier in the race for the nomination.

(Jon King/Michigan Advance)Corewell Health on Wednesday announced that it would no longer prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy for patients under 18, citing a “serious risk of legal and regulatory action,” as President Donald Trump’s administration works to limit access to gender affirming care for minors.
The decision by Corewell follows the hospital system’s decision to limit gender affirming care for minors earlier this year. It also now joins the University of Michigan as the second health system in the state to cease providing gender affirming care for minors.
“Like many health care systems across the country, we made this decision to protect both our health care providers and our patients,” the health system wrote in a letter obtained by the Michigan Advance. “We will continue to compassionately address the health needs of our patients who are in transition, or wish to transition, including providing mental health support.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Endocrine Society and other medical organizations have concluded that age-appropriate gender-affirming care is based on evidence and medically necessary.
Several studies have found access to gender affirming care – such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers – are associated with reduced cases of depression, anxiety, suicidality and overall improvements in mental health among trans youth.
Corewell Health said its gender care clinic would continue to see patients, and that they would continue to provide behavioral health, social affirmation and psychosocial support services. The hospital system advised parents who notice any emotional or behavioral changes in their child to contact their mental health provider or primary care provider to schedule an urgent appointment.
As another health system bows to pressure from the Trump administration, Erin Knott, the executive director of Equality Michigan said it was “devastating to see yet another healthcare giant turn its back on transgender youth and their families.”
“Corewell’s decision underscores a disturbing pattern,” Knott said in a statement. “Institutions that should be at the forefront of providing compassionate, evidence-based care are instead retreating under political pressure, leaving vulnerable young people to shoulder the harm. This is not just a matter of policy, it’s a matter of lives.”
Knott emphasized that gender affirming care for minors remains legal in the state, and that Equality Michigan would not stop fighting to expand access. 
At the end of August, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel reissued an open letter and renewed guidance to health care providers emphasizing Michiganders’ right to seek and receive healthcare services without discrimination.

WILMINGTON — The Urban Artist Exchange (UAE) Outdoor Amphitheater has been named a recipient of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Delaware Design Awards Program. 
The program highlights the transformative impact of architectural design while celebrating the projects and people that contribute to Delaware’s vibrancy. 
The UAE project transformed long-abandoned Wilmington Police Department horse stables into a multi-disciplinary arts campus. 
“The Tina Betz Urban Artist Exchange demonstrates the power of the arts in bringing people together,” said Mayor John Carney. “Thank you to Director Betz and everyone who worked for years to create a creative and educational space for the community.”
Led by Wilmington Director of Cultural Affairs Tina Betz, the project officially opened with the launch of the Arts Work Summer Youth Apprenticeship Program. The renovation work was completed by apprentices and masters with the Challenge Program in the city’s East Side Historic District.
The amphitheater was designed by Architectural Alliance and constructed by EDiS, opening for its first performance in May 2023. In May 2025, the campus was renamed The Tina Betz Urban Artist Exchange in recognition of Betz’s leadership.

“Recognizing this project with a design award is a testament to our city’s persistence, creativity, and most importantly, our vibrant arts community,” said Director Tina Betz. “The UAE was fifteen years in the making and worth every minute of the journey. Thank you to Architectural Alliance, EDiS, and the entire project team for helping bring this vision to life, and to the AIA team for being there every step of the way.”
Awards were selected by a five-member jury of architects from AIA Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. In their comments, the jury stated:
“The plan demonstrates a thoughtful and strategic orientation, effectively responding to the site, function, and surrounding roadway network. While the design introduces a departure from the existing vernacular through its form, it maintains cohesion through a consistent material palette. Notably, the careful attention given to the rear façade is commendable, recognizing its prominence as the most frequently viewed elevation.”
The amphitheater and UAE team will be formally recognized at an awards ceremony later this month.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-5.png,,,2025-09-11 11:57:00.013469

(Photo by Sean D. Elliot/Getty Images)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday endorsed the potential state purchase of a share of the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun as a savvy investment, not a subsidy of a franchise currently in play for a possible sale and relocation.
“Ask Mohegan Sun whether it was a good investment they made 20 years ago,” Lamont said.
The Mohegan Tribal Nation, the owner of the Mohegan Sun casino, purchased the team in 2003 and relocated it the arena in its casino complex. The tribe paid $10 million and currently is entertaining offers exceeding $300 million.
Lamont and Treasurer Erick Russell discussed the WNBA as a viable investment for a pension fund at a press conference announcing that the state pension funds are outperforming peers, with an annual return exceeding 10%.
“It’s been a very hot area,” Russell said. “This has been a big topic all around the country. We’ve seen other public pension plans that have invested in the space, particularly in women’s basketball.”
Industry newsletters and publications have been noting the interest in sports franchises as an investment over the past year, as one sports law web site reported in July.
“From Undervalued to Unstoppable: The Rise of Women’s Sports as a Prime Investment Asset,” was the headline of a story saying women’s sports are attractive for their lower entry price and high ceiling for growth in value.
‘A very risky proposition’
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, criticized Lamont for endorsing what Candelora called “a very high-risk investment with our pension market.”
“In general, investing in a sports team is a very risky proposition,” Candelora said, adding that Connecticut, situated between larger media markets in New York and Boston, has a checkered past when it comes to enticing top-level sports franchises to relocate or remain here.
Nuccio praised Russell’s pension performance but argued that the pension investment should go to safer places.
“We still have a massive amount of pension debt,” she said.
Flirtations with the New England Patriots ended poorly, and the NHL’s Hartford Whalers decamped for North Carolina in 1997 after a quarter-century in Hartford.
But Lamont and Russell said the value of the investment in Connecticut Sun is tied to the steady appreciation of equity positions in franchise ownerships, regardless of their balance sheet or whether they ultimately relocate.
“We’ve got private investors in alongside of us. In fact, junior to us. They like the nature of this investment. They think it’s a really good, solid, long term return for him and for our investors,” Lamont said.
Lamont acknowledged, however, the state’s interest was motivated by a desire to keep the team in Connecticut, either at the Mohegan Sun or the recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena in downtown Hartford. Formerly known as the XL Center, it is undergoing renovations.
The WNBA would have to approve a move to Hartford, but the state and Mohegan tribe have discussed keeping the team at Mohegan Sun, with a portion of the games played in Hartford. Whoever owns the team faces a significant capital cost: The construction of a practice facility.
“I’m trying to keep the Sun in Connecticut,” Lamont said. Noting the role UConn played in the popularization of the women’s college game, he said, “I think they belong in Connecticut, which is a birthplace of women’s basketball.”
A group led by former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, a billionaire who grew up in West Hartford, has made an offer for the team with the intent of keeping it in Connecticut. A Boston group previously made a bid with hopes of relocating it to Boston.
The WNBA, which sees Boston as a future expansion city, reacted cooly to a possible transfer of the Connecticut Sun. Sources say an expansion team in Boston would yield the league a $250 million expansion fee, while a transfer fee was much lower.
The Mohegan tribe is not committed to a sale. Sources say its current negotiating posture is a sale, taking on an equity partner, or retaining a minority equity position while selling a majority interest.
Similarly, Lamont said the state’s approach is flexible.
“We got a proposal out where we would buy the team. We have a proposal out where we buy a portion of the team and leave Mohegan Sun in there [as a partner]. So it depends on where the negotiations go, but we’re still in the game,” Lamont said.
If the state invests, it would insist on being the senior partner, meaning its share would be paid off first in any sale, Lamont said.
Russell said he is not directly involved in negotiations; his role would be to structure any investment to protect the pension fund. He currently has $63 billion in pension assets under the management of his office.
“What we would be looking at is something, if this is where we landed, that would be in the benefit of pensioners,” Russell said. “That is my priority as treasurer, as you see from the returns that we have demonstrated over the last few years.”

The Housing Development Authority Board’s approval this week of a $2.1 million loan to rebuild the water lines at the now-vacant Deadwood Ridge Apartments marks the first time the group has voted to pay for infrastructure money on a building that’s already built.
Lawmakers created the $200 million pool of funding in 2023 to address a statewide shortage in workforce housing. Half took the form of low-interest loans. The other $100 million — half federal dollars, half state dollars — was earmarked for grants.
The money was meant to cover up to a third of a developer’s cost on things like roads, water and sewer lines, and sidewalks through loans, grants or a combination of the two.
It’s been two years since the fund began to disburse money across South Dakota. Thus far, the program’s aided 78 projects in 41 cities. The initial pool of $100 million in grant funding is gone, but the program still has $65 million available for loans.

The fund earned $5 million in interest this year, and is meant to be rebuilt as projects repay their debt.
Fourteen projects have been completed, according to Amy Eldridge, director of rental housing development for the authority. Several others “are done, but they’re working on completing the documentation” to certify as much. 
Another 64 projects are being built now, Eldridge told the board. 
Tuesday decisions 
All the loans and grants must first be approved by the state’s Housing Development Authority Board. When that board met Tuesday in Sioux Falls, its members approved an $814,000 loan to help cover the infrastructure for a $2.4 million, 94-rental unit project in Spearfish and an $846,000 loan to help a $2.6 million, 68-lot development for single family homes in Crooks.
The third ask for infrastructure funding was more expensive and complicated. 
The Deadwood Ridge Apartments in Deadwood are already built, at a cost of $11 million. The initial project didn’t ask for or use any infrastructure funding, and was meant to open its doors to tenants in 2024 but didn’t. The initial developers and engineers failed to submit their drinking water and wastewater plans to the state’s Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources before the building began. When the time came to open, the unreviewed project failed to pass regulatory muster.

As a result, the infrastructure needed to be redesigned and rebuilt. Fixing the error and putting the apartments onto the market in the historic West River tourist community will cost another $6.5 million.
On Tuesday, the housing board reviewed owner Daniel Henderson’s request for help covering that cost. He asked the state to waive an infrastructure program rule that limits how much loan money can be used to cover labor costs, which in this case included fees for a new engineer.
Henderson’s request, for a $2.1 million loan, was $1.5 million more than the board would typically allow for labor costs on a project of its size.
Board member Mark Roby, of Watertown, wanted to know what would happen if the board said no. 
“There would be a building that sits in Deadwood that doesn’t get leased out,” Eldridge said.
Chas Olson, the authority’s director, said there’s enough funding to offer the loan, and the apartments “are really badly needed” in Deadwood.
The board first approved the waiver, then the project application, after assurances that the complex owner was in a strong position to repay the loan. Both votes were unanimous.
Remaining funds
After the meeting, Olson told South Dakota Searchlight that loan applications have slowed down in part because major builders are working on approved projects. Developers are also likely waiting to gauge how those projects will impact demand for housing in their respective areas.
The fund was launched to address what a legislative summer study concluded was a 10,000-home shortage in workforce housing across the state. 
So far, the infrastructure program has distributed or committed funds for more than 7,000 single-family home lots and more than 5,000 multi-family units.

NEWARK– Christ the Teacher Catholic School (CTTCS) has introduced a new House System for its 6th through 8th grade students, aiming to build community, encourage leadership, and boost both academics and school spirit.
The initiative is modeled after traditions used in schools worldwide and is designed to create what the school calls a “school family within a school family.” Students are placed into mixed-grade Houses where they will learn, collaborate, and compete throughout the academic year.

“Our goal is to foster deeper connections, leadership skills, and positive character development while celebrating school pride,” said Kelly Lanza, Principal of Christ the Teacher. “The House System gives students a chance to shine in new ways—academically, socially, and spiritually.”
How the House System Works

All middle school students have been assigned to one of seven Houses: Catherine, Mercy, Dublin, Carlow, Callaghan, Doyle, or McAuley.
Each House is led by a faculty mentor: Miss Donahue (Catherine), Mrs. Jones (Mercy), Mrs. Shea (Dublin), Mrs. Murray (Carlow), Ms. Phillips (Callaghan), Mr. Walton (Doyle), and Mrs. Glaviano (McAuley).
Students can earn points for their Houses through positive behavior, academics, teamwork, and service.
Houses will gather every other week for activities, competitions, and service projects.
At the end of the school year, the House with the most points will win a final prize to be chosen by the students.

The program began with a special kickoff event where students learned about their House history, met their teammates, and participated in games to start earning points.
“This is more than just a competition,” said Mrs. Lanza. “It’s about creating memories, forming bonds across grade levels, and empowering students to lead with faith and integrity.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8783.jpg,,,2025-09-11 10:56:47.917773

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The morning after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, Department of Public Safety and FBI officials said the manhunt for his killer continues while investigators recovered what they believe to be the killer’s weapon. 
“It’s a high-powered, bolt-action rifle,” FBI Special Agent In Charge Robert Bohls said. “That rifle was recovered in a wooded area where the shooter had fled. The FBI laboratory will be analyzing this weapon.” 
Investigators are also analyzing “footwear impressions, a palm print and forearm imprints for analysis,” he said. 
Bohls and Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said their investigation is ongoing, and they declined to release more information about the suspected shooter — other than saying overnight investigators tracked his movement through video camera footage. 
“We are confident in our abilities to track that individual,” Mason said. “If we are unsuccessful in identifying them immediately, we will reach out for the public’s help and the media’s help in pushing those photos.”
Starting at 11:52 a.m. on Wednesday, the shooter was spotted heading toward UVU’s campus.

“We have tracked his movements onto the campus, through the stairwells, up to the roof, across the roof to a shooting location,” Mason said. “After the shooting we were able to track his movements as he moved to the other side of the building, jumped off of the building, and fled off of the campus and into a neighborhood.” 
Investigators have contacted neighbors, “anybody they can with doorbell cameras, witnesses and have thoroughly worked through those communities trying to identify any leads,” Mason said. 
“We do have good video footage of this individual,” he said, but “we’re not going to release that at this time. We are working through some technologies and some ways to identify this individual.” 
If they’re unable to identify the suspect, then Mason said they’ll provide more information to the media to ask the public for help, “but we are confident in our abilities right now and would like to move forward in a manner that keeps everyone safe and moves this process appropriately.” 
Bohls said FBI agents have been working “around the clock” in partnership with Utah law enforcement to find Kirk’s killer. 
“We are and will continue to work nonstop until we find the person that has committed this heinous crime and find out why they did it,” Bohls said.

All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent sewer overflows, but as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress.
The post Western Mass. cities working to prevent sewer overflows amid funding challenges and intensifying rain  appeared first on Commo[...]","REPORTS OF TOILET PAPER, raw sewage, and other discarded items flowing through the Connecticut River in Suffield and Enfield went viral in recent weeks as Connecticut State Rep. Tami Zawistowski pointed the finger at Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee.  
“They all have issues that have emerged in recent years,” Zawistowski told WTNH News 8, claiming Holyoke alone “dumped” seven million gallons of sewage into the river in one day. “It’s time for Massachusetts to step up.” 
Officials in the cities that have been singled out say the “issues” that have emerged are intensifying rain events due to climate change.  
The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.  
Cities like Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee have historically combined sewer systems where both wastewater and stormwater come through shared pipes. During heavy rains, the excess flow bypasses the treatment plants where it is supposed to be cleaned and is instead discharged into local bodies of water to prevent backups in people’s homes.  
All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent overflows and have reached the final stages of separating their stormwater and sewer systems, significantly reducing their annual discharges. But as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress. 
Funding the expensive projects required to update the sewer systems is a daunting task, and the three Gateway Cities often lack the taxpayer base to pay for it.  
“By no means would I say that Chicopee, Holyoke, and Springfield have done nothing,” Springfield Water and Sewer Commission Executive Director Josh Schimmel said. “If we could wave a wand and make them go away tomorrow, we would, but we serve a disadvantaged population that pays for it.” 
Mary Monahan, interim director of Holyoke Public Works, said the city has already eliminated 70 percent of the overflows outlined in their legally binding performance improvement plan established with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Justice Department. Previous CSOs in Holyoke violated federal and state wastewater discharge permits, according to the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office. 
“On a normal day, we’re only using half the capacity of the plant,” Monahan said. “It’s only this rainfall that overwhelms it. Climate change is definitely exacerbating this issue.” 
Two projects amounting to $22.5 million are in the works now. River Terrace Phase A and B will continue the city’s efforts to separate the two systems and mitigate CSO events. Holyoke generally secures funding for CSO projects through the EPA’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which offers no interest loans.  
Last year, the city applied for a $19 million grant through the EPA’s Community Change Grants Program, a Biden-era initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that provides funding to disadvantaged communities for environmental projects. While waiting in the queue to be funded, the program was cancelled in May by the EPA under the Trump administration.  
The grant was going to help fund a new centrifuge in Holyoke’s treatment plant, which removes liquid from the waste sludge and lowers disposal costs. It is expected to cost between $3 million and $4 million.  
“For a city like Holyoke, it really is a financial burden,” Monahan said. “Our ratepayers are paying almost $2 million a year in debt service, and River Terrace Phase B is going to add more.”  
The city is required to report the volume of discharge associated with CSOs each time there is a rain event. While Zawistowski was correct in claiming that seven million gallons had been discharged into the river in one day, Monahan estimates that nearly five million of that had already been treated in their plant. She says the city is working on revising how they report CSO volumes.  
“Ninety-nine percent of the overflow could be rainwater, which is technically clean, and 1 percent of it could be the sewage that was in the pipe,” Chicopee Water Pollution Control project supervisor Quinn Lonczak said. “It’s hard to know what is actually going out.”  
Monahan and Lonczak, along with city officials from Springfield, say they want to see the Connecticut River clean as much as anyone else does.  
“If it’s a regional rain event and all of the other plants are overflowing, sure, there’s going to be water quality issues and everything coming downstream,” Monahan said. “We’re really easy to pick on.”

In Chicopee, between 80 and 85 percent of the city’s average annual discharge has been eliminated, according to Lonczak. Between 60 and 65 percent of their long-term CSO control plan projects have been completed. Since 2000, the city has spent close to $250 million on CSO-related projects. 
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not a cheap fix. And it’s not something that we ignore,” Lonczak said. “We’ve done a lot of projects here, spent a lot of money, and nearly all of that money is local. Our ratepayers here are paying for those projects.”  
While making considerable progress, Lonczak anticipates that completing the targeted projects will cost another $100 million before inflation. Some parts of the system are still combined, but don’t discharge a significant amount. He said the challenge is that now the city is left with project areas that will cost a lot but will ultimately remove only a small amount of overflow.  
A Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection report released in May showed that 543 million gallons of wastewater overflowed into the Connecticut River last year across 12 days with weather events, compared to nearly one billion gallons in 2023.  
“There’s a plan, and it may not be going as fast as the state of Connecticut wants, unless somebody starts writing some checks,” Lonczak said. “If you wanted to eliminate CSOs in Chicopee in five years … is it possible? Anything’s possible, it’s just the dollar amount.” 
Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995, according to the EPA.  
“We can handle regular rain. We’re going to get an inch and a half of rain over 12 hours? That’s no problem. We’re designed for that,” Lonczak said. “It’s short-duration, high-intensity events.”  
Springfield is less concerned with separating their sewer systems, according to Schimmel. Their CSO elimination projects involve a mix of separation in some areas, increased treatment plant capacity, and creating in-system storage. He says complete separation could solve one problem while creating another.  
“You can eliminate 100 percent of CSOs, and storm water alone is going to violate water quality standards every time it rains,” Schimmel said. “Although storm water is more dilute pollution by volume, it’s every bit as harmful as CSO. Separation reduces your combined sewer overflow, but it increases your stormwater.”  
Springfield has spent approximately $300 million on CSO projects, according to Schimmel, which have eliminated more than 50 percent of its CSOs in the last two decades.  
In the years following the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act, the construction of wastewater treatment plants was largely paid for by the federal government through grants. Local entities paid a small portion of the cost. Municipalities must now pick up most of the cost, while state and federal agencies finance small, if any portions of their projects, Schimmel added. 
“There’s never been free money since the 70s and early 80s for any of us to do CSO work,” he said. “The pendulum has swung completely to the other side. It needs to come back to the middle to some degree.”  
He takes issue with river alliance and environmental advocacy groups referring to the city as “polluters.”  
“How about you put all of that effort into advocating your state legislators to get us money to fix the problem?” Schimmel said.

(Photo by Dana Edwards/CT Mirror)Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.
Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.
The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.
Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.
While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.
“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”
According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.
In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.
Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.
Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.
The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.
In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.
Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.
But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.










This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island. It's actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region. 


– Connecticut DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes


Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.
“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”
In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.
While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.
“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.
One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.
“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”
In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.
Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.
However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.
“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate
Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.
Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)
“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”
Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.
Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.
Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.
Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.
A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.
Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.
“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.
At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.
State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.
Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.
“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”
Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.
While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.
“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”
Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”

 The Delaware Restaurant Foundation (DRF), the nonprofit arm of the Delaware Restaurant Association, was highlighted last week at the 2025 Hospitality Pathways Conference in Washington, D.C., for its leadership in workforce training and community collaboration.
The conference, hosted by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, brought together more than 200 workforce development leaders and industry partners to share best practices for building career pathways in hospitality. Delaware’s work with Hospitality Opportunities for People (Re)Entering Society (HOPES) and Restaurant Ready was recognized as a national model.
Expanding opportunities in Delaware
As a pilot state for HOPES, the DRF has played a key role in creating opportunities for justice-involved individuals, those reentering the workforce, and others facing employment barriers. Earlier this year, the foundation received new grants from the NRAEF and the U.S. Department of Labor to expand its work.
The HOPES Growth Opportunities 5 (GO5) program is designed for justice-involved youth, while HOPES Pathways Home 6 (PH 6) supports adults with industry training, national credentials, and employment support.
“We are proud that Delaware was among the first states to pilot programs like HOPES and Restaurant Ready, and to showcase what’s possible when industry, government, and community partners come together,” said Carrie Leishman, President & CEO of the Delaware Restaurant Association & Foundation.

“These initiatives are changing lives right here in Delaware—equipping people of all backgrounds with the tools to build meaningful careers in hospitality—and we’re proud to be a national leader in creating a stronger, future-ready restaurant workforce,” she said. 
National Recognition and Local Leadership
The conference focused on public-private partnerships that are helping transform lives nationwide. Delaware’s initiatives were featured as examples of effective collaboration across industry, government, and community organizations.
DRF Workforce Development Director Ruthann Messick led two sessions on program implementation and community partnerships. Her workshops shared strategies to improve outcomes for participants across the country.
“The restaurant industry in Delaware employs more than 53,000 people—one in 11 Delawareans—and our workforce programs are designed to ensure every person has access to opportunity,” said DRF Workforce Director Ruthann Messick. 
“We are proud to continue this work with our national partners, expanding pathways for individuals who are ready to take their first step or their next step in hospitality.”
Community Impact
For Delaware, HOPES and Restaurant Ready have become essential tools in meeting workforce needs while also expanding equitable opportunities. The programs provide mentorship, workshops, apprenticeships, certifications, and industry-specific training to connect participants with employers.
“What makes HOPES unique is that it’s community-based and community-focused,” said Kenna Mask, a HOPES participant from Delaware. “It goes into the trenches. It’s aware of where the need is.”
Mask was awarded a Dontavious Drake Hospitality Pathways Grant, a new scholarship honoring the late Dontavious Drake, a member of the Restaurant Ready and HOPES team. The grant supported Mask’s travel to the Hospitality Pathways Conference, ensuring program participants could share their experiences at the national level.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pathways-Coference2-e1757598848619-1024x815.jpg,,,2025-09-11 10:56:47.917773

New Mexico State University officials say the school is working to educate students to fill the gaps.
The Legislative Health and Human Services Committee met in Las Cruces this week on the NMSU main campus. Committee members were joined Wednesday by NMSU School of Nursing Director Alexa Doig and College of Health, Education and Social Transformation Dean Rick Marlatt. They provided an update on how the School of Nursing is preparing students to meet the health care needs of New Mexicans, especially people living in rural areas of the state.
According to a 2024 report by advocacy organization Think New Mexico, New Mexico needs about 5,700 registered nurses and clinical nurse specialists and about 230 certified nurse practitioners to meet current national benchmarks. The report also notes that the state has some of the oldest physician workforce in the country and nearly 40% of doctors 60 years and older are expected to retire by 2030.
“We want to make sure that [students] understand what’s waiting for them out in the professional field, and the sooner we can get those hands-on experiences, the better,” Marlatt said during the meeting.
Doig highlighted the school’s postgraduate Advanced Practice Registered Nursing certificates, which offer specialized training for nurse practitioner students in several areas, including psychiatric and mental health. “This is really the primary program that is educating and training mental health practitioners who have independent scope of practice within New Mexico,” she said. The program is offered through “distance education,” Doig said, to allow students from all over the state to participate from their location in rural areas or other.
Students studying family practice are also able to complete a second certification program in psychiatric and mental health. The overall program took a hit in enrollment and graduation during the COVID-19 pandemic, Doig said. And while it is still a smaller program, more than 50 students currently participate and numbers continue to improve. She also said about half of the participating students are from New Mexico. 
“I think post-COVID, people really saw, especially nurses, a real need for mental health care providers and they recognize that they can fill that gap,” Doig said. She also pointed to the school’s efforts to integrate primary health care training with behavioral health so all students are equipped to address their patients’ mix of physical and mental health needs. All nursing students take a course on integrated care for diverse populations, which Doig explained “blends and helps amplify the connection between physical health and mental health, and then how to deliver this more integrative care approach.”
Doig stressed the value of having dual certification, but told lawmakers that certified nurse practitioners in New Mexico face the barrier of health care organizations requiring them to choose only one area of practice, rather than integrated care. She told lawmakers she would like to work with them to change policies so practitioners are better prepared to help patients with their various needs, particularly in rural settings or areas with larger health care worker shortages.
“We are in a provider shortage, and we have been for a long time and for the foreseeable future,” Doig said. “There are many jobs available, especially for a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. There is such a severe shortage, our students are often getting job offers before they graduate…Our employment rate data is usually between 90% and 100%.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NMSU-nursing2-1024x715.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

The Dunleavy administration repealed the rule in 2024, saying it was counterproductive and argued it contributed to higher health care costs. Medical providers say that isn’t true and that repealing the rule will cause some clinicians to close down. 
In 2023, a group of medical providers sued the state, alleging problems with the process used to repeal the rule. On Aug. 27, following a four-day bench trial in February, Judge Yvonne Lamoureaux ruled in favor of the state. 
In her findings of fact and conclusions of law, Lamoureaux concluded that the repeal was not “unreasonable or arbitrary,” and the state did not conduct an improper procedure.
An appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court is possible.
When in place, the rule required that insurance companies reimburse out-of-network medical providers at a rate equal to the 80th percentile of charges for the given service.
If five clinics provide a given procedure, the required payment would be what the second-most-expensive clinic charges.
The rule was intended to prevent Alaskans from being left with large medical bills after visiting out-of-network clinics. The state and Alaska’s largest health insurance company, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, contend that it required insurance companies to pay more for services than was warranted, contributing to higher insurance costs.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Former Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Syl James said he was convinced “CAVE people” were the greatest obstacle to solid leadership in municipal government.
James, a Democrat who led the city from 2011 to 2019, said Wednesday at the Dole Institute of Politics that successful leaders needed vision, discipline, data and community backing. The most challenging piece of the puzzle was that some people evaluated city projects based on how they might benefit personally as opposed to the city as a whole, he said.
“They’re called CAVE people — C-A-V-E. It stands for Citizens Against Virtually Everything,” James said. “Dealing with skeptics and CAVE people was always difficult.”
He said coalition building was integral to advancing initiatives in Kansas City, including a commitment to demolish the old Kansas City International Airport’s three-terminal complex and build a single-terminal airport. The same could be said for developing a streetcar line or launching North America’s first technology-enabled “Smart City.”
“You want kids to come back home? You got to be willing to give them some stuff to come home to,” James said. “More technology. A little bit more open. It’s a little bit more edge.”
James, 73, works in consulting with Joni Wickham, a former chief of staff in the mayor’s office. She moderated the conversation with James at the nonpartisan Dole Institute on the University of Kansas campus.
 
Two-Scotch rule
James said he appreciated the value of social media as a vehicle for sharing information when he joined City Hall. He learned to abide by a self-imposed rule for posting to X, which was known as Twitter.
“I was banned from tweeting after two Scotches,” James said. “Media has a place, and the problem is that that place is being abused. Frankly, it just becomes mob thinking. It’s totally out of control.”
James said people who withdrew from the chaos of American politics ran the risk of empowering people “who think it’s not messy enough.”
He urged anyone drawn to electoral politics to first seek public office at a local level. That’s the place to learn how problems created at the federal and state levels flow to local government, he said.
“When you get to the upper levels, it all becomes whether you’re Democrat or Republican,” he said. “That’s not what public service is. We have a lot of politicians acting in the service of themselves and their party.”
In terms of public safety, James said he wouldn’t have welcomed a U.S. president’s deployment of National Guard troops to Kansas City without clearly articulated conditions put down in writing.
National Guard units that were assigned crimefighting roles would need to be supervised by local law enforcement officers who understood state laws and municipal ordinances, he said. Anyone who federal troops placed in a city jail wouldn’t have been eligible for transfer without legal due process, he said.
President Donald Trump dispatched National Guard personnel to Washington, D.C., in a purported effort to cut crime, but some of those soldiers were observed picking up trash and doing landscaping work.
“This is a publicity stunt. It’s a high-profile distraction. It’s also a way to infiltrate ICE into your community in a way that you can’t really avoid so they can do whatever nasty crap they want to,” James said.
 
Playing ball
James said he understood the argument for possibly drawing on tax dollars for new stadiums for the Kansas City Royals or Kansas City Chiefs. He said Arrowhead Stadium could be renovated, but problems with Kauffman Stadium argued for replacement.
He said there wouldn’t be much debate about taxpayer-supported stadiums if Kansas City was still trying to attract NFL and MLB franchises.
“I grew up in this city when there was no baseball or football,” James said. “It was dead.”
There were highs and lows during eight years as mayor, he said. He regretted a 2019 public vote rejecting a sales tax to finance universal pre-K instruction. And he said there was nothing worse than standing in a crowd of people as a mother disintegrated when told her child had been shot.
The opposite end of the spectrum came in 2017 when voters approved of a $1.5 billion single-terminal Kansas City International Airport.
“Regardless of whether this is good or bad, the work isn’t done. It all works together, so, ‘This is great, but let’s get back to work. This really sucks, like, let’s get back to work.’ If you don’t do that, then you’ll just be bouncing around like a ping-pong ball. And, after four years of that, you’ll be ready for a loony bin,” James said.
 
‘No negativity’
James said his first campaign for mayor of Kansas City came down to a runoff with fellow attorney Mike Burke. He said they had respect for each other and had comparable ideas for moving the city forward.
“There would be no negativity,” James said. “We didn’t run to beat each other. We ran in order to serve our city. And, when you don’t run to try to beat somebody, you don’t have to be a jerk.”
He said part of his mission at City Hall was to convince the public that positive things were possible. He needed that sentiment to restore public interest in investing in economic, educational and social change.
“At that time, Kansas City was a city that never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity,” he said.
He drew from childhood experiences and a career as an attorney and mediator to find consensus in the community.
“I grew up in an all-Black neighborhood. I went to an all-white high school. Every day I was in two different worlds,” he said. “If you can look at the same situation and see both sides of arguments, then you might be able to see a middle point in there where those arguments come together, and you can resolve the issue.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sly-James-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 09:56:28.037134

The stalled budget talks between the House and Senate have left  Michigan schools in uncertain territory with the threat of closures on the horizon.
On Wednesday, members of the Michigan Association of Superintendents and Administrators and the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity met in Lansing to highlight how the continued lack of a budget is harming Michigan schools, forcing them to pursue loans and dig into their savings in the absence of state funding.
Just as members of the Legislature are legally required to complete the state budget by July 1 each year, Michigan school districts must also complete their budgets by July. 
Without a budget from the Legislature, school districts are forced to formulate their budgets based on guesswork, said Tina Kerr, executive director of the Michigan Association of Superintendents and Administrators.
“Lawmakers have obviously missed that deadline. They violated state law, they’ve broken trust with our schools, and most importantly, they’ve put Michigan students in jeopardy,” Kerr said. “Every day that passes without a budget districts are forced into further contingency planning. Instead of focusing on what we should be right now, which is student success, these superintendents and their entire teams are spending time and resources again, trying to guess what the funding will look like.”

Schools cannot operate indefinitely without stable funding, and district leaders are already preparing for the possibility of closures if a budget is not put into place, Kerr said. She urged prompt action from the Legislature and the governor to pass a budget.
Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, warned that students who need the most help are the first to lose out, with literacy coaches, bilingual teachers, after school programs and mental health services often serving as the first item on the chopping block when budgets are late.
He pointed to survey data from Michigan School Business Officials, a statewide leadership and management group, which found 11% of districts among those surveyed have laid off teachers, while 15% have laid off non-classroom staff and 42% have made cuts through attrition.
Although wealthier districts can patch the holes left without a budget, low income and rural schools do not have a safety net, Spadafore said.
“Political gridlock cannot be allowed to rob students of stability and opportunity,” Spadafore said. “Every single day the Legislature fails to act is a day children are forced to learn in uncertainty, and that’s unacceptable to me and everyone in this room.”
John VanWagoner, the superintendent of Traverse City Area Public Schools, told reporters that the K-12 budgets presented by the House and Senate are so different, superintendents cannot project what funding they will eventually get.
While Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) previously told schools to hold fast as they work to broker a deal with the Democratic-led Senate, school leaders argue it’s not that simple, given the distance between the two chamber’s proposals and the time it takes to distribute funds to schools, and to secure a loan. 
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

“We’re talking to our newer superintendents saying if you don’t have the cash flow, you need to be applying for your loans now. So even if the money comes as we’re hearing, they still have to have that contingency plan in place,” Kerr said. 
If schools have not taken their contingency plans seriously and payments from the school aid budget do not arrive as expected on Oct. 20, those districts could face closures, Kerr said.
Senate appropriations leader: K-12 funding could be made whole if moved to roads, higher education
In a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday, state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) was asked about letters sent to parents of students at Lansing schools, calling on them to contact their legislators and urge them to protect K-12 funding.
A similar letter was sent to parents in Allegan area schools on Monday.
Like Kerr, the districts warned of late school aid payments in October.
Another sticking point in the state budget negotiations is whether to use some K-12 funding for other priorities, much like roads or higher education funding.
Anthony was asked if she could commit to not using those dollars for anything other than K-12 funding.
In response, Anthony said she’s heard from multiple school superintendents on the issue.
“I’ve made it very clear to all of them that I always believed that school aid dollars should compensate education,” Anthony said. “That’s what I believe taxpayers have committed to. That’s what they expect. Does that include higher education? All of that is a part of these negotiations.”
Anthony added that she has been a huge proponent of increasing higher education funding.
“What I can commit to you is that, what we’ve heard from our colleagues in the Senate, is that we want to make sure there are adequate backfills,” she said.
When asked what she meant by backfill, and if that meant some type of revenue to replace school aid funding taken to fund another priority, Anthony said yes.

Glenn Youngkin in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin called federal legislation to allow parents to donate tax-free towards their kids’ schooling — including private schools — a “landmark” moment for education on Wednesday afternoon.
However, public school advocates have opposed the measure, citing concerns about funding diversion, inequity, lack of oversight, and constitutional risks. 
The legislation, known as the Educational Choice for Children Act, makes it easier for parents to send their children to private schools or other non-public options by allowing individuals or businesses to donate money tax-free to organizations that provide scholarships to families. 
Virginia has a similar program known as the Education Improvement Scholarships Tax Credits Program, which provides state tax credits for donations made to approved scholarship foundations. 
According to the Virginia Department of Education, the foundations provide scholarships to eligible students attending certain private schools and non-public pre-kindergarten programs. Approved scholarship foundations make payments directly to eligible schools selected by qualifying parents or legal guardians.
“First of all, this was a landmark moment where a tax incentivized choice program that works incredibly well in the commonwealth of Virginia, and we have a very successful one, translated into a national policy moment,” said Youngkin on Wednesday afternoon at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.
States may choose whether or not to participate in the program. Youngkin, whose term ends soon, said the next governor will need to wait for further guidance to come out before committing Virginia to the initiative. However, he said he would like to see the commonwealth opt in first, saying it is a “hugely” important step.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

Opponents, including the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have argued that the “the majority of taxpayers do not support the use of public monies for private education” and that the tax credits could divert essential funding from public schools to private institutions.
During his tenure, Youngkin has tried to provide alternative educational opportunities for Virginia’s K-12 students, including an unsuccessful plan to offer scholarships for students to attend private schools and cover other educational expenses. He also struggled to meet the goal of starting 20 charter schools, with the state constitution requiring state and local approvals. Virginia has a total of seven charter schools.
However, his administration did celebrate the establishment of the state’s 15th lab school — the Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore — during his tenure. 
In 2010, the General Assembly and Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell passed legislation establishing laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools. The schools are developed and operated in partnership with colleges and universities and designed to offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology.
For over a decade, no lab schools were established due to a lack of funding and interest. But in 2022, Youngkin and the General Assembly allocated $100 million to fund their development, with Virginia Commonwealth University opening the first in 2024. Institutions can receive up to $200,000 for one-time costs to design and, if successful, can earn a $1 million start-up grant. 
On the new scholarship tax credits program, Youngkin reiterated Wednesday, “I will not leave office without making sure that Virginia has already agreed to do whatever is necessary for us to fully participate.” 
There is no timetable for when the federal government will provide guidance to states on implementing the legislation but it is likely an issue the state’s next governor will need to address. Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, who was Youngkin’s running mate and is the current lieutenant governor, has been a strong supporter of education options beyond public schools. Her opponent, Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger, wants to keep as much public funding in Virginia’s schools as possible.

WILMINGTON — The Saint Mark’s Spartans started their journey to a second consecutive flag football championship with a 19-6 win over Ursuline Academy Wednesday evening.
The Spartans started the scoring with under ten minutes to play in the first half. Sophomore quarterback Madelyn Fausnaugh pitched the ball right to her running back Tanai Tippens just a few yards out of the endzone. Tippens flew down the right sideline evading every defender in her path to put the Spartans ahead.
St. Mark’s added to its lead on its first possession of the second half and scored once more on its ensuing drive with a pair of rushing touchdowns. Ursuline got itself on the scoreboard with a passing touchdown late in the second half.\
Ursuline and St. Mark’s were two of the four inaugural programs (Padua and Delaware Military Academy) to offer girls flag football as a school sport. Last season, the four teams played a three game regular season culminating in a championship game between Padua and St. Mark’s. The Spartans won the game by a three-point margin.
This season the girls will play a seven game regular season. Concord High School, Cape Henlopen High School, William Penn High School and Newark Charter are all fielding teams this fall adding to the first four.
The eight-team pool will battle it out during the regular season for a spot in the semifinals and championship games scheduled for late October.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4181-002.jpg,,,2025-09-11 09:56:28.037134

“The Dixon Awards celebrate the vital work of citizens across New Mexico who make sure open and transparent government is more than just lip service,” Dixon Awards Committee Chair Daniel Russel said in a statement. “Those being honored are among the best at turning that principle into reality — by exercising the rights we all have — and ensuring everyone has access to their government.”
The Dixon Freedom Award winners in the government category are City of Santa Fe IPRA Manager Katherine Garcia-Gallegos and state Rep. Sarah Silva (D-Las Cruces). The media category winners are Cibola Citizen Editor Diego Lopez and Santa Fe New Mexican columnist Milan Simonich.
NMFOG said Garcia-Gallegos in November 2024 “ushered in a new era” at the city’s Records Department by putting all police-recorded crash reports online, easing the department’s workload and giving the public greater access.
Garcia-Gallegos told Source NM that IPRA requests for accident reports accounted for nearly 55% of the city’s total requests in 2024, and over the last few years her team noticed they were receiving multiple requests for the same report.
NMFOG praised Lopez’s dedication to transparency, investigative reporting and ability to explain complex constitutional issues in a December 2024 series about the Cibola County Commission.

The group said Simonich has for decades held politicians in Santa Fe and across New Mexico accountable, spotlighted free speech issues and covered open meetings law.
NMFOG noted Silva, as a freshman lawmaker, passed legislation that would have required lobbyists to disclose bills they were paid to influence and who was paying them, though Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ultimately vetoed the bill. NMFOG also pointed to Silva’s recent effort to protect journalists from being forced to reveal anonymous sources or unpublished information that stalled after passing through two House committees.
Silva is married to journalist Heath Haussamen.
“Knowing who influences our elected officials, having access to public documents and expressing our opinions to shape public life for us and our families: These things are critical in a healthy democracy,” Silva told Source NM via text message.

California Democrats and Republicans alike offered their condolences following the news that Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist and supporter of President Donald Trump, died Wednesday after being shot at a university event in Utah.
Gov. Gavin Newsom — who spoke with Kirk in March on the first episode of his “This is Gavin Newsom” podcast — postponed an event to tout his ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional districts in response to the shooting. In a statement on social media, Newsom said he admired Kirk’s “passion and commitment to debate.”

Newsom: “His senseless murder is a reminder of how important it is for all of us, across the political spectrum, to foster genuine discourse on issues that deeply affect us all without resorting to political violence.”

The Democratic-led Assembly held a moment of silence in honor of Kirk before gaveling in Wednesday, while other Democratic officials — including California’s attorney general, legislative leaders and U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi — condemned the shooting. 
Both GOP leaders in the Legislature also acknowledged Kirk’s work within the party, with Assemblymember James Gallagher of Chico saying that “no one did more to lead the conservative youth movement,” in the 21st century than Kirk.
As the founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk led the “largest and fastest growing conservative youth activist organization in the country,” according to the nonprofit. A firebrand figure in the country’s culture wars, Kirk drew the ire of Democrats over his views on the COVID-19 pandemic, his staunch support for gun rights and his endorsement of Christian nationalism.
Kirk and his organization often toured college campuses, which were sometimes met with protests from students. In 2023, demonstrators objecting to his appearance at UC Davis clashed with police, though a UC Berkeley event the year before took place without incident.
Kirk’s appearance on Newsom’s podcast surprised many, particularly after the governor broke with the Democratic party by agreeing with Kirk that trangender athletes participating in girls’ sports was “deeply unfair.” 
Newsom underscored his complicated relationship with Kirk in his tribute, adding that the best way to honor Kirk’s memory was to engage in “spirited discourse” rather than violence.

Other Stories You Should Know


Will this bill dent police transparency laws?

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu:
California lawmakers are close to rolling back public access to police misconduct records — just years after expanding it. 
Records of use of force, sexual assault and other misconduct — once difficult to obtain — are now required to be disclosed upon request under laws California adopted in 2018 and 2021. Carve-outs in the state law allows agencies to only redact information that would endanger police officers. 
But under Assembly Bill 1178, authored by Democratic Assemblymember Blanca Pacheco of Downey, when deciding whether to redact records, courts would also have to consider if the officer is working undercover and deserves anonymity because of their duties. 
Supporters argue existing law threatens the safety of undercover agents. But transparency advocates slammed the bill, arguing it risks confusing courts and would allow records to remain hidden simply because of an officer’s role. 

George Parampathu, of ACLU: “This vague notion that an officer’s duty may demand some level of anonymity … doesn’t absolve them of the responsibility over the harm they cause with their misconduct.”

Lawmakers have until Saturday to vote on the measure.



TLDR: Late deals in the Capitol

With the last day of session nearing, let’s dive into some legislative news:

Deal on environmental and energy bills: Through closed-door negotiations, lawmakers struck a multi-pronged deal Wednesday that would extend California’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction program for the next decade; boost in-state crude oil production; replenish the state’s wildfire fund; and advance a handful of bills further regulating utility companies. Read more from CalMatters’ reporters.


Right to unionize: A deal made with ride-hailing companies has sent a bill to Newsom’s desk that would allow Lyft and Uber drivers to unionize. But it also means another measure to enable those companies to pay less in insurance coverage for their drivers would likely advance. Read more from CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.


A YIMBY exception?: Pro-housing advocates notched a win earlier this year after lawmakers approved a measure exempting most urban apartment developments from the state’s landmark environmental review law. But a proposal, introduced Monday night, would make a peculiar exemption from that new policy if passed. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.


Delta tunnel: The Legislature has punted a proposal, backed by Newsom, to speed up the contentious Delta Conveyance Project. The massive $20 billion state water project aims to reroute more water from Northern California southward. Lawmakers representing Delta communities say they are relieved that the proposal is dead for now, but experts say Newsom would likely revisit the idea. Read more from CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.




And lastly: A breather for immigrant kids

A U.S. district court judge handed Trump a loss Wednesday, issuing a preliminary injunction that allows states, including California, to continue providing federally-funded public services to immigrants without legal status. The services include benefits such as free preschool for low-income children and shelter for unhoused people. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.

Sept. 10 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceA Macomb County lawmaker has gathered support from both sides of the aisle for her plan to protect people from raw sewage in waterways through a proposed system warning about high levels of E. coli.
Rep. Alicia St. Germaine’s (R-Harrison Township), told the House Natural Resources and Tourism Committee that House Bill 4427 would require counties to issue a “brown alert” if dangerous levels of sewage or E. coli are detected in their waters. 
St. Germaine explained that the bill was prompted by the release of more than a million gallons of raw sewage into the Red Run Drain, a small river which was converted into a drain in the 1920s and 1960s. The drain flows into the Clinton River and out into Lake St. Clair. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Needless to say, it’s a lot of raw sewage, and the residents that live along those waterways never knew,” St. Germain said.
E. coli is a type of bacteria found in human and animal intestines, which the state uses as an indicator of water quality. E. coli in waterways can indicate that water is contaminated with feces. 
While E. coli itself can cause illness including stomach pain and vomiting, the bacteria is also used as an indicator for other types of harmful organisms which cause diarrhea, giardia, hepatitis or cholera.

The county’s drain commissioner, public works commissioner, water resources commissioner or their designee would be responsible for determining if dangerous levels of contamination are detected, and would be required to inform the county’s health department of the hazard as soon as practical, and within 12 hours of their determination.
Under a substitute version of the bill adopted by the committee, the County’s health department would also be responsible for issuing an alert to residents as soon as possible, with requirements to issue the alert within 12 hours.
The alert would be sent directly to residents’ phones and would list the location of the contamination and the health risks of exposure. 
The bill was also crafted with input from Macomb County Public Works Commissioner and former GOP state Rep. Candice Miller, St. Germaine told committee members. 
The committee did not take a vote to refer the bill to the House floor for further action, however, committee chair David Martin (R-Davison) said work was being done to refine the policy, and that there was more to come.

,California,2025-09-11 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Google wasn’t against this privacy bill, officially. Behind the scenes, it orchestrated opposition",Khari Johnson and Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/google-lobbying/,Google organized business owners against California legislation to force its Chrome web browser to safeguard personal data.,"In summary
Google organized business owners against California legislation to force its Chrome web browser to safeguard personal data.


In April, Rhode Island resident Navah Hopkins received a plea for her help to defeat  legislation thousands of miles away in California.
The ask came from Google, maker of the world’s most used web browser, Chrome. The tech giant sent a message to an email list that Hopkins and other small business owners were subscribed to. Google’s request: To sign a petition opposing Assembly Bill 566, which would require browsers to provide users with a way to automatically tell websites not to share their personal information with third parties. The measure is sponsored by the California Privacy Protection Agency, which enforces state regulations on such sharing.
In its email to Hopkins, Google claimed that the legislation would “hurt your ability to use online ads to reach customers.” 
“It was intentionally misleading people that by this bill passing, they were going to lose out on all of these tools within Google (to advertise),” she told CalMatters. 
The outreach was particularly noteworthy because Google had not itself taken a public position on the bill. The tech giant was so quiet about its opposition that Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal, the author of AB 566, did not know about Google’s email push until a CalMatters reporter asked. Lowenthal also said his office did not receive small business owners’ signatures or outreach.
Google’s name wasn’t on the petition either; instead, the document was officially from the “Connected Commerce Council,” which the tech giant backs financially.
The largely behind-the-scenes campaign offers a glimpse into how the tech giant is working to preserve its grip on the online advertising market and how it attempts, without being seen, to shape policies in a state with one of the nation’s strictest privacy protection laws.
Recruiting small businesses to represent the policy interests of a tech giant isn’t new. Last year, Google successfully blocked a similar bill — ultimately vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom — by adopting the same tactic, reaching out to small businesses via email lists, according to a message obtained by CalMatters.
There’s no telling how effective Google’s lobbying on the measure has been this year, or how many people it successfully mobilized. Experts warn that the strategy could backfire if the people it reaches out to, like the small business owners, aren’t buying what the company is selling. 
But before the browser bill reached its final floor vote, Lowenthal amended it to delay the effective date until 2027 and to add liability protections for browser companies like Google. 
When asked who advocated for that language, Lowenthal said he’d taken input from “colleagues and stakeholders” to shape up the “strongest possible bill.” 
“With any bill that’s been vetoed before, it takes some give-and-take to get it across the finish line,” he said.
Google did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Google ranked among the most active lobbyists in California last year, spending more to influence the opinions of elected officials than it had in the previous 20 years combined. The lobbying was aimed at battling AI regulation, local news funding requirements, and a prior version of the browser bill. 
This year, it has disclosed pouring nearly $700,000 into lobbying state leaders on bills including AB 566. Google has also increased lobbying spending in many other statehouses, according to the Open Markets Institute. With inaction in Congress, states have led the way in tech regulation in recent years.

But it’s hard to trace Google’s full influence when the company does not publicly share its position on bills like AB 566, instead paying groups like the California Chamber of Commerce and Connected Commerce Council to influence legislators on its behalf.
Google registered to lobby 17 bills this year that sought to do things like place warning labels on social media or protect people from algorithms that make health care decisions, but the company only publicly stated its position on one bill that sought to require online age verification, according to state filings and Digital Democracy.
Google’s lobbying tactics, while not illegal, demonstrate the sway money has over policies, said Sean McMorris, the transparency, ethics, and accountability program manager at California Common Cause.
“This type of activity … exemplifies the skewed playing field that we have to play on,” he said. “It’s important to report on and to point out these strategies and loopholes that money can afford you the privilege to engage in, and the public has every right to scrutinize whether that is just or not.”
If Google really believes this bill shouldn’t become a law, its lobbyists should show up to testify at a public hearing, not behave in shadowy ways that undercut democracy, said Brandon Forester, an organizer for MediaJustice, a nonprofit that has been critical of the influence of of Big Tech companies and internet service providers.
“None of us wants to enter a surveillance marketplace every time that we go on the internet,” he said. “​Part of the reason they need to do the shadow lobbying is because the things that they want to do to achieve their infinite growth model is not good for the public.”
AB 566 is not the only threat Google faces to its grip on how people surf the web. A judge ruled last month that the company may no longer enter into exclusive distribution deals for Chrome or Google search. And Chrome faces new competition from a number of AI-powered browsers entering the market, reportedly to soon include one from ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
Onerous mandate or consumer convenience?
Under a 2018 state law, California businesses must provide customers with a way to forbid the sharing or sale of their personal information to businesses. AB 566 seeks to streamline that process. 
Browsers such as DuckDuckGo, Brave, and Firefox already have privacy features that, once enabled, automatically send an opt-out signal to each website the user goes to. 
The California Chamber of Commerce opposes AB 566, arguing it represents an onerous mandate. The measure lacks clarity, regulates browsers that aren’t “consumer-facing” and is hard to implement, the trade association argued in a letter to lawmakers.
“Browsers and devices already compete to offer clear, effective privacy controls,” Ronak Dalami, a lobbyist for the chamber, told lawmakers in July. 
A similar bill the Legislature passed last year would have required both web browsers and mobile operating systems to offer ways to automatically prohibit the sharing of a user’s personal information, but Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill because no major mobile operating system includes such an option.
“To ensure the ongoing usability of mobile devices, it’s best if design questions are first addressed by developers, rather than by regulators,” Newsom said in a veto message.
Bianca Blomquist, California director of nonprofit Small Business Majority, which represents 85,000 small businesses nationwide, was among the business owners who received an email last year from Google, on a mailing list of businesses that participated in the company’s training program, Grow with Google. The letter argued that allowing people to easily stop companies from sharing their personal information would make it more expensive for small businesses to sell their products. 
But Blomquist was skeptical. And while Newsom’s veto message spoke of design risks, she said that most people she talks to “are more concerned about their data being shared than they are too many buttons flashing on a screen.” 
To Blomquist, the email is clear evidence that Google was “leveraging” the data it collected from partners for advocacy. 
“What we find is that small business owners … and partner organizations oftentimes sign on to support or oppose legislation without having an understanding of what it does.”
Connected Commerce Council
The petition Google circulated this year was authored by Connected Commerce Council, or 3C, a lobbying group that in 2022 claimed to represent 15,000 small businesses but lists Google and Amazon as funders and partners. In 2022, Google and Amazon mobilized their users to fight anti-trust bills in Congress by encouraging them to sign a model online petition the council drafted. That year, the nonprofit published and later removed a membership directory of 5,000 small businesses, many of which told Politico they were not members of the organization. 
This spring, the group sent a letter to California state lawmakers, arguing that the requirements proposed in AB 566 would cause small businesses to lose out on customer data and make their websites more expensive to operate. 
“Implementing a sweeping experiment that would jeopardize small businesses’ success, limit Californians’ access to relevant products and services, and potentially disrupt access to free web content, is not a sensible way forward,” wrote Rob Retzlaff, executive director of the group.
In a virtual press conference last month, the organization put forward two California online business owners who oppose the legislation. The owners argued that the browser feature mandated in the bill could inadvertently drive away customers, would block them from sending targeted ads to users who opt out of having their personal information shared, and would make it impossible for customers who opted out to opt back in.
“If they opt out of one thing — maybe they just didn’t want … my weekly emails about moms connecting, but they want to have discounts — how are we going to segment that?” said Michelle Mak, owner of baby product store Mewl Baby.
Google did not report paying the commerce council any money to lobby on its behalf to the California secretary of state. But Google reported paying the California Chamber of Commerce, the face of its opposition, almost $100,000 to lobby this year. It also reported paying TechNet, which also registered its opposition, $2,500. 
Connected Commerce Council spokesperson Jennifer Hodgkins declined to answer a list of questions from CalMatters, instead providing a statement pointing to the organization’s letters to the Legislature, press releases and statements from small business owners featured in its press conference.
“Small business owners are deeply concerned about the impact AB 566 will have on their ability to advertise online, find new customers, and grow,” Hodgkins said. 
John Myers, a spokesperson for the California Chamber of Commerce, declined to answer a CalMatters question about the payments it received from Google.
But McMorris of Common Cause said Google’s payments to the chamber for lobbying should be “closely scrutinized.” 
“If it’s not for (AB566), then what was it for?” he said. “That’s where the law gets murky, and you have these wink and nod relationships where both sides know how to play the game without explicitly saying, ‘This is how we are going to play the game.’”
Mobilizing users a unique tactic
It tracks that Google turned to small business owners to protect the company’s business model, said Jeremy Mack, director of the Phoenix Project, a group that tries to draw attention to San Francisco Bay Area front organizations secretly funded by tech billionaires.
Mack said the practice is reminiscent of how Uber and Lyft mobilized people who use ride-hailing apps to fight Proposition 22 and keep gig workers from being defined as employees instead of contractors, and tactics embraced by apartment landlords and realtor groups.
“It’s not surprising that Google would do this, but it’s definitely good to be able to flag this for people and put it on their radar,” he said.
Unlike other industries seeking to influence policy, tech companies can mobilize users through their online platforms, said Austin Ahlman, a researcher who tracks Google lobbying efforts in state capitals for the Open Markets Institute. It’s part of a long pattern of tech companies using small businesses that rely on their platforms to preempt regulation.
Meta also has a history of recruiting small businesses to represent its interests, and Google and Meta threatened or prevented people in Australia, Canada, and California from seeing the news to oppose a demand that the companies pay to link to news websites. An earlier, prominent instance of tech companies using their platforms to influence legislation came around the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act when major companies, including Google, organized to shut down their websites for a day in September 2012 to oppose those laws.
“Frankly, it mostly works.”Jeremy Mack, director, Phoenix Project, on tech companies mobilizing their users against regulation
Mack thinks mobilizing users has been devastatingly effective, but companies probably do it sparingly because if they do it too often people will be more aware of how much  control large tech companies have over people’s information.
“I’d call it anti-democratic, but I wouldn’t call it desperate, because, frankly, it mostly works,” he said.
Powerful companies typically combine traditional lobbying and strategies used by civil society organizations when regulatory pressures threaten their core business model, according to a 2023 research paper about corporate lobbying campaigns. Those tactics were  historically associated with the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, but tech companies have innovated on and rejuvenated the lobbying form. They can do so more effectively because they can tap into user data and their platforms give them unmediated communication with customers.
Companies typically recruit users to advance their policy initiatives when they sense a threat to their business and no longer believe conventional lobbying will be sufficient, said UCLA sociology professor Edward Walker, who studies how companies mobilize customers to speak out about legislation.
But it only works if users are motivated to speak out, such as when video game players fought efforts to regulate in-game violence, or when for-profit college students opposed a push by the Obama administration to keep them from receiving federal student aid.
“It’s important to know that these kinds of grassroots lobbying strategies, or user mobilization strategies, are a double-edged sword. It’s not a given that they’re always going to work in your favor,” he said. “If you do this in a scattershot way, you really increase the risk it’s going to backfire on you.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s yearslong redistricting lawsuit is back before the Utah Supreme Court as the Utah Legislature’s attorneys continue to fight a lower court ruling that tossed out the state’s 2021 congressional boundaries. 
Legislative attorneys argue the tight timeline the court has laid out to select a new map before Nov. 10, in time for the 2026 election, has only heightened “the separation-of-powers harms to the Legislature” and doesn’t wholly abide by the 2018, anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that the judge has now deemed law. 
The lawsuit’s plaintiffs — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and several Salt Lake County voters — had a fiery response to those arguments in their rebuttal submitted to the Utah Supreme Court late Tuesday. 
Utah Supreme Court will consider lawmakers’ appeal against drawing new congressional map

“It is difficult to avoid the jarring irony running throughout Legislative Defendants’ petition — that now, more than five years after defying the will of the voters and gutting every meaningful part of Proposition 4, it is the Legislature that wants to be its newfound champion, claiming Utah voters must abide yet another election cycle under an unlawful map because there just isn’t enough time to pay adequate fidelity to Proposition 4,” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. 
They argued that the Legislature claims it now needs to be rescued “from an ‘emergency’ that is self-created at best and wholly illusory at worst.” 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson, they argued, has “put in place an orderly process, similar to what courts across the country have used in analogous circumstances.” 
“That process will (finally) result in a legal and constitutional map being in place for the 2026 election cycle,” they wrote. “There is no ‘emergency’ simply because the Legislature does not want to do the work voters demanded and that it should have done five years ago. The petition, which is heavy on rhetoric and light on analysis, should be denied.”

Gibson ruled on Aug. 25 that the 2021 map was the product of an unconstitutional process after the Utah Legislature repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative, Proposition 4, which created an independent redistricting commission. By passing SB200, the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature turned that commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore — which is what they did when they drew the 2021 congressional map that anti-gerrymandering groups have called “blatant gerrymandering.” 
Legislative attorneys are now appealing to the same court that handed them a major blow last summer, when all five justices on the Utah Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion that Gibson — who had previously dismissed the claim that the Legislature violated the Utah Constitution when it repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative — had erred. 
On Saturday, the Utah Supreme Court granted Utah lawmakers’ emergency request for an expedited review of their petition to block Gibson’s ruling, which asked the court to grant or deny their motion no later than Sept. 15 given the tight timeline the Utah Legislature now faces to draw a new map by Sept. 25. 
Gibson amends ruling, says she ‘overstepped’ by ordering lawmakers to draw a new map
As the case rapidly winds through the Utah Supreme Court, Gibson also filed an amendment Saturday clarifying her Aug. 25 ruling while also officially adopting the timeline parties previously agreed to setting deadlines for the new map-drawing process. 
While Gibson’s ruling continues to block Utah’s 2021 congressional map, Gibson amended it to “remove the ‘order’ requiring the Legislature to ‘design and enact’ a new congressional plan in the next 30 days.”
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

“That ‘order’ failed to recognize the separation of powers between our courts and our legislature and unintentionally failed to respect the Legislature’s authority to determine how to address the Court’s order enjoining H.B. 2004,” Gibson wrote. “This Court overstepped its authority by ordering the Legislature to enact a new congressional plan.”
However, that doesn’t change the timeline that has been set to remedy the tossed-out 2021 congressional map, which Gibson deemed a product of an unconstitutional process. 
While her ruling allows the Legislature to decide whether to submit a map or not, the court still retains jurisdiction over selecting a new map to be used in the 2026 election — whether it’s submitted by lawmakers or by the lawsuit’s plaintiffs. 
Here’s the schedule attorneys for the Utah Legislature and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs have agreed to abide to and Gibson’s latest order has affirmed:

Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary.

The goal of a bill proposed by Assembly Democrat Buffy Wicks is to seed solar farms on fallowed fields.,"In summary
The state’s farmers are divided over a bill that would loosen rules protecting agricultural land. The goal of a bill proposed by Assembly Democrat Buffy Wicks is to seed solar farms on fallowed fields.



Ross Franson stood on the road between two fields, where nothing grows under the Fresno County sun. 
As a teen, Franson hauled a water tank to spray down the dust on roads like this — rolling past rows of almond and pistachio trees, the CD on his Discman skipping with every bump. 
A quarter of a century later, with water supplies squeezed by climate change and regulation, the dust has spread beyond the sunbaked track to barren fields. Now, on one side of the road, a field sits empty — fallowed, tire-tracked and dry. On the other stands a new crop: solar panels, in glassy black rows behind a chain-link fence. 
“We’re farmers. We’d rather farm,” Franson said. Still, he added, “This is the only way I think people are going to survive out here, if they’re able to find out other uses for some of the ground like this.” 
The valley that was once a refuge for people fleeing the Dust Bowl is facing its own reckoning with dust and water scarcity. And it has prompted scientists and policy experts to wonder what to do with land left behind. Why not solar? they ask.
It’s an existential question for the most agriculturally productive state in the nation. Now, California lawmakers are wading in, with a bill that aims to clear away a financial hurdle for energy developers and landowners eager to plant solar farms with battery storage on fallowed fields. 
Authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland, the bill tackles the Williamson Act, 60-year-old law designed to fend off the creep of suburbia. 
Under the law, farmers and ranchers can enter into 10- or 20-year agreements with local governments to keep their land in farming. In exchange, they receive cuts in their property tax assessments that can range from 20% to 75%. But cancelling the contract before the term ends incurs fees that can reach millions of dollars. 
Wicks’ bill would allow farmers and ranchers to suspend their Williamson Act contracts if they plant solar and storage on water-stressed farmland. Property taxes would go back up, but they would avoid the cancellation fees. 
“In general, I think that this is probably a good way to help grease the wheels for more solar development,” said Andrew Ayres, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno and an author of a 2022 report on solar and groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley. 
But there are so many opposing forces pushing and pulling at efforts to develop renewable energy, Ayres said, “All of these things do come along with caveats and tradeoffs.”
Fallow fields, energy opportunities
California’s ambitious climate laws call for the state’s grid to run entirely on renewable energy by 2045. 
Hitting that target will require hundreds of thousands of acres of new solar generation near communities that need it, with enough transmission and battery storage that the electricity doesn’t go to waste. 
The question is where to put the panels. Solar farms on public lands with valuable wildlife habitats and ecosystems are deeply controversial. 
“‘Put it on agriculture!’ is one of the solutions to that,” said Dustin Mulvaney, a Professor of Environmental Studies at San José State University. “California needs a lot more solar, and it needs solar closer to its population centers.” 
The Central Valley — California’s agricultural heartland — is in a prime location, Mulvaney said. 
Already, about half of the almost 100,000 acres of large-scale solar developed in California is in the San Joaquin Valley, California Energy Commission staff told CalMatters based on their analysis of a federal database. 
The San Joaquin Valley is also at the heart of California’s water crises. The state’s landmark groundwater law, enacted more than 10 years ago after thousands of wells in the valley went dry during drought, is now tightening its grip on growers pumping from some of California’s most critically overdrawn aquifers. 
With no new water supplies, up to 900,000 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley could go out of production over the next 15 years, according to estimates from the Public Policy Institute of California. 
“An uncomfortable truth California must reckon with is that we are facing a significant lack of access to water across many of our rural counties,” Wicks said at a Senate hearing in July. “Whether this bill passes or not, up to one million acres of farmland is soon going to be fallowed.” Wicks’ office did not respond to a request for an interview.

About half of California’s 30 million acres of farm and ranchland is covered by Williamson Act contracts. Renewable advocates say it’s a no-brainer to seed solar farms onto fallowed ground, and the proposal has precedent. 
In 2011, California lawmakers enabled landowners to cancel Williamson Act agreements in order to use their land for solar energy projects, as long as the soil was already in poor condition. 
Wicks’ bill would expand this little-used provision to allow landowners to suspend Williamson Act contracts on land facing water scarcity, and to include solar energy storage and other related facilities as well. 
“I can’t find a downside here, and that’s why it’s always fascinating to me when I hear people saying, ‘Well, solar is going to cause a loss of farmland.’ It’s mind boggling,” said Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-Scale Solar Association. “If folks are concerned about solar occupying those fallowed lands, what are they saying they’d prefer?” 
Even if Williamson Act penalties are cleared away, other roadblocks remain, Ayres said. 
There are permitting lags and supply chain slowdowns and bottlenecks in transmission that can stop solar energy from reaching population centers. The Trump administration has upended tax credits for renewable energy projects. And the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant Fire is stoking local concerns about building battery storage facilities near homes. 
For some projects, the Williamson Act “could be a very significant impediment,” Ayres said. “For other projects, it could be minimal.” 
Farmers, divided
Whether to further loosen state policies protecting open farmland is a question dividing the farming industry. 
By the end of August, big-spending labor interests had aligned with solar companies, the Kern County Farm Bureau, the Almond Alliance, wine grape growers and others in support. They say that if farmers can’t readily plant solar panels, all they’ll grow is dust. 
Franson’s company, Woolf Farming and Processing, farms 20,000 acres near the Fresno County town of Huron. Water shortages, he said, have forced the company to fallow about a quarter of that land — sometimes more.

Leasing some to a solar developer helps offset the costs of holding onto it, and allowed him to consolidate limited water supplies for fields still growing crops.  
“I got three little kids that I would hope would want to be involved in the family business of farming,” Franson said. “This is basically the only way they’re going to have any kind of chance of that.” 
On the other side are the California Farm Bureau, organic and family farm organizations, and other farmland conservation groups listed in opposition at the end of August. They are far outgunned and outspent by supporters, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy. 
Opponents warn that pulling at the threads of the Williamson Act’s protections could fray the fabric of farming regions, unraveling the economies of scale that help agriculture to operate efficiently. They want to see the definition of water-stressed farmland narrowed, and the bill scaled back to only the driest parts of the state.  
“If you start taking …  agriculture out of an area, you don’t have to remove all of it for agriculture in that place to die,” said Peter Ansel, the California Farm Bureau’s director of policy advocacy. “The trucks that come to pick up produce from fields, the contract laborers that come to bring people to the fields — all of that requires your neighbors still farming.” 
He points to Imperial County, which does not have an active Williamson Act program, as a glimpse of the future. In July, the powerful Imperial Irrigation District board condemned siting solar farms on active farmland, which they said have already consumed 13,000 acres — “providing little to no benefit for local communities.” 
Ryan Jacobsen, chief executive of the Fresno County Farm Bureau, said undermining the Williamson Actis a slippery slope. 
“You’re doing it for solar — why aren’t you doing it for affordable housing?” Jacobsen asked. “You’re doing it for housing; why aren’t you doing it for a racetrack facility? I mean, it just goes (on). Where do you stop?”
Leaping ahead, or leaving farm towns behind 
Whether Wicks’ bill passes or fails, it exposes fears about losing farmland in regions long dependent on agriculture to drive employment and local economies. And it raises concerns that farmworker communities already burdened by poverty and pollution will face new threats from whatever industry takes its place. 
María Dolores Díaz, a widowed grandmother who lives in the tiny town of Cantua Creek, once worked in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley — even while pregnant, even with her children beside her. She can still picture her son’s little hands covered in tape, to protect them while he picked garlic. 
In Spanish, she remembered how she’d warn him. “‘Well, this is how things will go if you don’t study,’” she would say. “But thanks to God, my kids studied. That’s the dream one has, that they have a better job than we do.”
Her son went on to become an engineer, Díaz said proudly, and moved away from Cantua Creek. Still, she wonders what a future with fewer agricultural jobs holds for tiny towns like hers, that are woven into the fabric of farm country.

Even as the Trump administration’s immigration raids and an aging population constrict the agricultural workforce, economists project that land fallowing from water shortages could cost up to 50,000 agricultural jobs in the San Joaquin Valley. 
Gretchen Newsom, a spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Ninth District, said that the union offers apprenticeship programs to help train future electrical workers — including a pilot Spanish language program in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
But Federico Castillo, a project scientist with UC Berkeley’s Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, said even with training opportunities, it’s an open question whether there will be enough jobs to fill gaps left by lost agriculture. 
“There is no reason to believe that farmworkers displaced by solar farms have, in any way, shape, or form, the ability — even when trained — to get into the jobs,” he said. 
Wicks’ bill would require renewable energy developers to make community benefits agreements with local governments. Such agreements could include job creation and training programs and funding to benefit workers displaced by water scarcity. 
Environmental justice organizations that work with Díaz’s town and others like it have not taken an official position on the bill, but say they want to see enforceable benefits such as reduced electricity bills that are tailored to the local communities. 
“There is going to need to be some oversight to make sure that happens,” said Michael Claiborne, an attorney with the environmental justice group Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability. “We shouldn’t just leave existing communities that have long histories behind them with no legitimate future.” 
Stuart Woolf, chair of Western Growers — and Ross Franson’s uncle — told CalMatters he’s concerned that piling too many requirements on solar developers undermines bill’s power to help landowners put water-stressed farmland to use. As of the end of August, the association was not listed as supporting the bill, and did not respond to CalMatters’ inquiries. 
“I, for one, am a little anxious that if you try to squeeze too much out of these things, then it’s not really going to accomplish the benefit for the grower that wants to do it,” Woolf said in August.

But Díaz said communities like hers will bear the risk. She worries about battery fires near a town with no fire station. And she fears that the landscape where she owns a home and raised her family will never be the same, not if neighboring landowners decide to participate in massive solar and storage projects planned nearby. 
For her, the orchards around Cantua Creek are part of her town. They’re where she takes walks, and sees her neighbors and their children biking and playing outside.  
“It’s a beautiful thing to be able to walk between the trees. It’s like a garden. We live in an area where there are no parks,” Díaz said. “Where will we walk, what shade will we have, with all the solar panels? … Maybe we’ll have to walk on the edge of the road.”

(File)The Joint Legislative Contract Review Committee last week approved $600,000 in legal services contracts to defend corrections officers accused of excessive force in three separate lawsuits.
The first two went to Wallace, Jordan, Ratliff & Brandt, LLC out of Birmingham for $200,000 each.
“The first one is a continuation of representation,” said Clay Crenshaw of the contracts awarded to the first law firm, chief deputy with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, on Thursday.

“And then, over on page 91, we have a conflict situation,” Crenshaw said pertaining to the second contract. “He represents the only defendant in that particular case.”
The third was given to Cappell & Howard, PC in Montgomery, for $200,000. The AG’s Office is representing several corrections officers in that case but sought to contract with a legal firm for the other defendants, citing the experience W. Allen Sheehan, an attorney with the firm, has with the cases.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

Committee members approved the contract awards one month after Sen. Tom Butler, R-Madison, requested that a legal contract that totaled $200,000 for Butler Snow LLP be held after Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, expressed concerns about giving a legal contract to William Lunsford, an attorney with the firm who has gotten millions of dollars in DOC contracts over the years. Lunsford was removed from a civil lawsuit after one of his co-counsel, Matthew Reeves, acknowledged using artificial intelligence to create legal filings that were found to contain false citations or citations to nonexistent cases.
England sought information from the Alabama Attorney General’s Office concerning the number of civil lawsuits filed against the ADOC that stems from alleged wrongdoing by corrections officers, the status of the cases and how much money the state has paid to law firms to represent the defendants in those cases.
He wanted to gauge if it would be more cost effective to settle the cases instead of continuing to pay outside counsel to represent the state as the cases continue.
The status of the delayed contract was not clear as of Wednesday afternoon.
The first of the two contracts awarded to Wallace, Jordan, Ratliff & Brandt involves a civil lawsuit filed by the father of Michael Smith, who died in November 2019 while incarcerated at Ventress Correctional Facility located in Clayton.
The lawsuit alleges that Smith was taken by corrections officers to a hallway in the facility after getting into an altercation with another individual over a pack of coffee. According to the complaint, corrections officers struck and beat Williams, who lost consciousness while bleeding from his head, nose and ears. He was eventually transported to a nearby  hospital where he later died.
The second contract is to represent corrections officers and state officials in a lawsuit brought by McArthur Lynch, incarcerated at Ventress, who alleges that a corrections officer had injured someone.
The Cappell Howard contract is to defend DOC in a civil rights lawsuit brought by the mother of Rubyn Murray, who died in Elmore Correctional Facility in July 2023.
The lawsuit alleges that Murray got into an argument with a corrections officer while in a breakfast line. According to the complaint, Murray was pepper-sprayed by the officer, beaten and placed in isolation, where he was beaten further and left in his cell for several hours. Murray was later found unresponsive in the cell and transported to a hospital, where he later died.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Correctional-officer-1024x648.jpg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904
,California,2025-09-11 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Political change is coming to San Francisco Bay Area, a Democratic stronghold",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/democrats-san-francisco-bay-area/,"Two mayors, San Francisco’s Daniel Lurie and San Jose’s Matt Mahan, personify the rising influence of centrists among Bay Area Democratic leaders.","California is one of the nation’s bluest states, and its bluest region is the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.
In San Francisco itself, there are eight times as many registered Democrats as there are Republicans and while Democratic margins in other Bay Area counties are not as lopsided, 4-to-1 or even 5-to-1 ratios are standard.
Last year’s presidential election saw similar overwhelming majorities in the region for Vice President Kamala Harris — a product of Bay Area politics — over Donald Trump.
Accordingly, 100% of the Bay Area’s congressional and legislative seats are held by Democrats, and the party utterly dominates county boards of supervisors, city councils and the governing boards of school districts and other units of local government.
John Burton, a long-serving congressman and state legislator who died recently at age 92, personified the Bay Area’s history of Democratic hegemony.
The political organization he, his late brother, Phil Burton, and former Assembly Speaker and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown founded in the 1950s remains — at least as long as the 91-year-old Brown remains alive — a very potent player in regional, state and even national politics.
However, Democrats didn’t always dominate Bay Area politics. Until the 1960s, the region had many Republican officeholders and a few remained into the 1980s, particularly in the suburbs.
The Bay Area is not going to change its partisan stripes anytime soon, and probably never. However, an interesting phenomenon is developing in the region — the rise of Democratic political figures who hew to the middle, much to the chagrin of those on the party’s left wing.
Two Democratic mayors, San Francisco’s Daniel Lurie and San Jose’s Matt Mahan, personify the drift, and an atmospheric change in San Francisco’s governing Board of Supervisors, long a bastion of progressive politics, is another indication.
Lurie, elected last year, comes from personal wealth and philanthropic engagement and shuns ideological conflicts while promoting fiscal responsibility and reform of his city’s notoriously restrictive regulatory processes.
His most recent effort is what he calls PermitSF, a package of  “six ordinances with common-sense changes for those living, building housing, or operating a business in San Francisco.”
“Today, we are getting rid of the nonsense and focusing on common sense, with a new set of reforms that will make it easier for San Franciscans to live, grow, and invest in this city,” Lurie said as he revealed the package.
Progressives on the city’s governing board may resist Lurie’s actions but, as a recent  San Francisco analysis of voting records points out, “For the first time since 2019, the city’s left-leaning supervisors are outnumbered by a more centrist group that not only has more seats but also consistently votes together.”
Meanwhile, Mahan, who had careers in philanthropy and high technology before running for mayor in 2022, is also a non-doctrinaire Democrat. He broke with the party by endorsing Proposition 36, a 2024 ballot measure to crack down on crime, and recently published an article sharply criticizing Newsom for ignoring the state’s bad business climate.
Mahan said “the governor, and every elected official and leader, also need to own up to the truth. And the truth is that California has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 5.5%, and nearly half the nation’s unsheltered homeless people. We have the highest energy and housing costs in the continental United States, and, largely because of these high costs, the highest effective poverty rate in the nation.”
When one political party becomes dominant, it often fragments into factions defined by geography, culture, personality or ideology. What’s happening in the Bay Area exemplifies that pattern.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/101821-San-Francisco-Painted-Ladies-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

Susie Lee, says he is guided by science, a notion that could put him at odds with President Donald Trump’s White House, where some fear science is taking a back […]","Republican congressional candidate and physician Aury Nagy says scientific inquiry reveals the gender “that's hardwired into your brain can be different than the gender that's expressed externally. That's just biology, and I think most people aren't aware of that.” (Nagy campaign video screengrab).Dr. Aury Nagy, a Las Vegas neurosurgeon who is running in the Republican primary for Congressional District 3, a seat currently held by Democrat Rep. Susie Lee, says he is guided by science, a notion that could put him at odds with President Donald Trump’s White House, where some fear science is taking a back seat to politics.
Trump, for instance, rejects the notion of gender ideology. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order recognizing two sexes – male and female – and eliminated  
federal funding for gender-related programs.  “Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself,” the order says. 
Nagy says scientific inquiry reveals the gender “that’s hardwired into your brain can be different than the gender that’s expressed externally. That’s just biology, and I think most people aren’t aware of that.”
Another concern for Nagy is the COVID messenger RNA vaccine deployed during Trump’s first term. Nagy, who served as president of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, asked Gov. Joe Lombardo to ban the vaccine, which he says may be dangerous. 
Trump, on the other hand, is mentioned as a potential Nobel Prize winner for Project Warp Speed, the initiative that delivered the vaccine in record time. 
Philosophical differences aside, Nagy is eager to join Trump in Washington. 
“For at least another two years, we have somebody in the presidency willing to burn down the institutions that have been failing Americans and replace them with something that works,” he said during an interview Tuesday. 
Nagy says CEOs of for-profit health care companies are incentivized to charge as much as possible while delivering minimum care. 
As a legislative observer, he says “it seemed there were lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry and the hospitals, the insurance companies, the hedge funds and the personal injury attorneys practicing medicine, but there was almost nobody representing the patients or the people who take care of them.”  
Last year, he formed the White Coat Party, a group of health care professionals who share his concerns. The group wants “laws that severely punish companies that repeatedly put profits over patients.” 
Under Trump, health care and pharmaceutical corporations are enjoying tax breaks and greater profits. 
‘The way God made them’
Nagy says he has long been aware of research indicating biological differences between heterosexual and homosexual individuals can be identified by examining the nucleus of the hypothalamus that corresponds to gender identity. 
He says he once was concerned insurance companies would discriminate against gay people, based on their brain scans. He became more willing to discuss it, he says, when a young man confided that as a teenager “he thought that God hated him because he was gay, and that really impacted me.” 
People, he says, should understand “this is just the way they were born — the way God made them. That is what we have learned through science.” The information, if taught in sex education classes, “could be valuable to the understanding of sexuality.” 
Nagy says he’s enlisted two Southern Nevada hospitals – Sunrise and Mountain View – to assist in “creating a protocol to measure the size of the nucleus, and so we’re hoping by this time next year we can start a study to actively pursue that.”
Gender reassignment therapy should not be allowed until imaging demonstrates the area of the brain associated with gender identity “corresponds to the gender preference expressed by the minor,” says the White Coat Party’s legislative agenda. “Imaging results are not valid until 4 years of age, at which time the size of the nucleus in the brain involved in sexual identity has reached maximum size.”
If elected, he’s hoping to cut through the “racism and bigotry” displayed in Trump’s anti-gay agenda and enlighten the Religious Right, which he suggests may have co-opted Trump, who he notes was previously more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.  
Warp Speed? Not so fast.
Nagy, in the White Coat Party’s legislative agenda, cites research that found fragments of DNA in the Covid vaccines. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the double-helix shaped molecule that carries genetic data that informs the development and reproduction of living things, including viruses. 
“There’s a chance that DNA can jump into your own genome,” Nagy told the Current. A “misfolded” protein, he says, could cause an autoimmune reaction, while a protein that malfunctions could make it more difficult to suppress cancers. 
Nagy says he wrote to Lombardo, “telling him we need to ban the use of this vaccine until we get these questions answered,” but has not heard back. The governor did not respond to a request for comment. 
Nagy’s warning is a reprise of Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo’s earlier call for a ban of the vaccine nationwide. The theory cited by Lapado and repeated by Nagy has been discredited by a variety of authorities as faulty science.  
Nagy says he is unaware of Ladapo’s recent announcement that Florida will end mandates for childhood vaccines. 
“I thought it was just for Covid,” he said, adding he would look into it. 
He supports revisiting the schedule at which childhood vaccines are administered, and says he appreciates Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.’s willingness to disrupt the status quo, even though Kennedy’s words and acts have “raised some red flags. I don’t think he’s been 100% accurate on everything he said, but I do appreciate the focus that he’s drawn to these issues. I think he’s going to fund science that’s going to help us to find out the truth on these issues.”
Last week, House Republicans rejected Trump’s effort to slash funding for the National Institutes of Health by 40% and voted to keep funding flat. 
Among other initiatives supported by Nagy, some of which place him at odds with Trump’s, are: 

Requiring nurse-to-patient ratios that support patient health and the well-being of nurses. In June, Lombardo vetoed a measure supported by nurse unions that would have imposed ratios; 
Implementing a 2% room tax to help pay for Medicaid, which is expected to be cut under Trump; and
Removing barriers to parents providing healthy meals by marshaling the resources of the hospitality and sports industries, as well as local growers via the Nevada Nutrition Coalition, which Nagy formed in the interest of improving mental and physical health. Meanwhile, Trump cut grants that provide locally grown foods to schools and food banks, and will require states to fund SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).

Governor Lombardo and Nevada’s legislative leaders need to take action now to ensure our state is able to continue to fund this critical program.
Beginning October 1, 2026, states will be required to shoulder 75 percent of SNAP’s administrative costs, up from the 50 percent they have historically covered. According to Nevada’s Division of Social Services, this change alone requires $19 million in additional state funding between October 2026 and June 2027. Beyond that window, Nevada must plan for $25 million in recurring annual costs. These are not estimates; they are direct obligations tied to federal law that Nevada will have to meet.
This new mandate arrives at a difficult time. As many as 130,000 Nevadans could lose benefits due to the new eligibility rules included in H.R. 1. That means fewer households receiving SNAP, even as the state assumes greater financial responsibility for administering the program. This paradox puts Nevada in the position of investing more resources into a system that will serve fewer families, underscoring the need for careful fiscal planning and strong administrative oversight.
The impact on Nevada households cannot be overstated. SNAP has long served as a safeguard against hunger for families who may otherwise face food insecurity. Without timely state action, the risk grows that administrative challenges could slow or complicate benefit delivery, leaving families vulnerable during moments of need. A gap in SNAP funding could create cascading consequences, forcing parents to make impossible choices between rent, utilities, and groceries. Such instability does not simply affect individual households—it erodes confidence in public programs and leaves communities less resilient in the face of economic shifts.
That is why budgeting for SNAP’s new administrative costs cannot be delayed or treated as a secondary issue. The Legislature will undoubtedly face many competing priorities in any special session, but this one cannot wait. Ensuring SNAP is properly funded must be on the agenda, and the $19 million needed this biennium must be set aside. Other issues can be debated later—SNAP administration funding is both urgent and unavoidable.
Nevada has always prided itself on prudent budgeting and forward-looking planning. Meeting this new obligation requires the same approach. Lawmakers must commit to funding SNAP administration in any special session, even if other priorities are deferred. Beyond this biennium, Nevada will face $25 million in ongoing annual costs, which means the state must begin long-term planning now to prevent future shortfalls.
For families, the issue is about food security and stability at home. For the state, it is about meeting legal obligations and ensuring government remains responsive and reliable. The mandate is clear: plan now, fund the program, and protect Nevada’s most vulnerable residents.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2230334598-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

(Screenshot, ACCS YouTube)The state’s community college system plans to launch a task force with a goal of improving outcomes for incarcerated people in the system’s educational programs. 
The task force, involving several different government agencies, will focus on working with imprisoned individuals to build skills so they can enter the workforce upon release, Alabama Community College System (ACCS) Chancellor Jimmy Baker said Wednesday, as well work on strategies to reduce recidivism.  
“What we’re trying to do is create a system where all the agencies that in any way impact incarceration or the release [of prisoners] so that when someone has gone to prison, they’ve had some understanding how to improve themselves, but they also have all the skills,” Baker told the ACCS Board of Trustees.

ACCS runs J.F. Ingram Technical College, the state’s only correctional education provider. The college, which  provides training in 19 career fields, as well as GED preparation, adult education and soft skills training for entering the work force, had 3,000 students enrolled in 2023. 
Baker told the board the task force has piqued the interest of legislators and the goal is to help formerly incarcerated people find jobs.
“Our mission, to the extent that it possibly can be, is that if a student or a person is incarcerated, and we know that they are at some point going to be out of confinement, start a process to determine what we can do to provide a training program so they, upon completing their sentence, can have a skill and know that there’s a job,” Baker said to the board.
The chancellor said the focus on cutting recidivism would be “a major coordination of all the efforts between convictions, mental health, Department of Human Resources and education,” he said. 
“Just trying to improve what we’re doing so we can reduce the number of people that return back into the [prisons],” he said.
Baker said in an interview Monday that the task force isn’t focusing on particular facilities or skills, but in the future it will.
“We’ll get to a point where we will probably will and it will be timed with knowing the jobs that are available and the companies who will hire someone who is [formerly incarcerated],” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.50.29-PM-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

Council members voted unanimously on Tuesday to advance a measure that would allow property owners to build and operate “accessory dwelling units.” Washoe County currently has separate regulations on units. 
The final vote is scheduled for Sept. 24.
Original language approved by the planning commission last month sought to also prohibit units from being rented for less than 28 days, but the council Wednesday removed that language and instead intends to work on a separate short term rental ordinance.
States and cities across the country have passed laws regulating or authorizing the building of accessory dwelling units. Some housing policy advocates have sought reform around ADUs as a way to address the affordable housing shortage. 
Reno attempted to bring forward an ordinance on ADUs in 2018, but it failed. In 2024, they began the process of seeking public input on another ordinance. 
After receiving community feedback, initial drafting of an ordinance began earlier this year, said Grace Mackedon, a senior management analyst with the city. 
State lawmakers then passed Assembly Bill 396 in this year’s legislation session, which required the most populous counties and cities that don’t have an ordinance on ADUs to draft one by July 2026.
The legislation would prevent any city ordinance from requiring more than one additional parking space per ADU. Any ordinance couldn’t prohibit separate kitchens facilities from being included in units. 
“Staff then took all of our feedback through this whole process that received any requirements from AB 396, and with that, we modified the ordinance,” Mackedon said. “We created a second draft, and we went back to the planning commission for a formal recommendation. 
The ordinance approved by the planning commission last month
If passed, ADUs couldn’t be taller than a primary residence, must allot one additional parking space and can only be located on lot size of at least 5,000 square feet.
“Staff believes that this 5,000 square foot minimum is a compromise between those that wanted a smaller or no minimum lot size and those that wanted it to stay at 9,000 or even larger,” Mackedon said. 
In a verbal motion, City Councilwoman Naomi Duerr also attempted to add a provision that required written notice of units be mailed to residences within a 500 feet radius. She later deleted the request. 
The ordinance received a significant amount of public comment, including from former state Assemblywoman Sharron Angle. 
Angle said the state legislation was passed too hastily and urged the council to be cautious when adopting its ordinance warning it could create density and traffic problems.
“I’m not against this and I’m not for this either. I’m neutral,” she said.  “You have an opportunity to allow for growth but smart growth. Things that make sense for neighborhoods … Things that could impact neighborhoods negatively can now be stopped right here.”
The council also discussed how ADUs should, or shouldn’t, be regulated as short-term rentals going forward.
“We allow homes to be rented out as” short term rentals, said Duerr. “We allow rooms in homes to be rented out as STRs. We would be only saying, only this one kind of building structure can you not have STR in. I’m nervous about that. Doesn’t seem very fair.”
Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve said she wanted the ordinance to include some sort of restriction on short term rentals since the city has yet to pass separate regulations. 
Though she voted in favor of the ordinance, she said she was “a little disappointed” it didn’t include the language with the 28 day limit. 
“I don’t love this outcome,” she said. “But we have to move forward for clarity and so that it becomes something where we are moving into the future.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-9-10-25-at-1.04 PM-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

It allows the restaurant to be staffed and prepared for larger-than-usual groups.
Well, FIFA has made a reservation for up to 650,000 visitors to Kansas City for the six World Cup matches played at Arrowhead Stadium in 2026.
As ticket sales begin — including four group-stage matches, one round of 32 match and one quarterfinal match hosted in KC — some restaurant leaders are nervous that the area’s hospitality industry isn’t ready for the flood of guests that the World Cup will bring.
“I fear for Kansas City a year from now,” said Jenn Tosatto, beverage director for Penny’s Restaurant Group. “We’ve worked really hard to show that we aren’t just a flyover city and that we have things to offer in our food and beverage scene. But we’re not at our strongest right now.”
Chef Shanita McAfee-Bryant, founder of The Prospect KC, a hospitality workforce development nonprofit, also is worried. She points to the job listing site Indeed, which currently shows more than 6,000 food service job openings, as a cause for concern.
“We have a shortage of 6,000 jobs,” said McAfee-Bryant with the first World Cup match less than a year away. “So how prepared do you think that is? Not prepared at all.”
According to the Mid-America Regional Council, the area’s food service industry employment never fully recovered from COVID. The area is still roughly 1,100 jobs short of the pre-pandemic employment level. Bureau of Labor Statistics data also shows that the larger hospitality and leisure sector in the KC area has shed thousands of jobs each month this year when compared to 2024.
McAfee-Bryant said those numbers mean that if the World Cup started today, Kansas City would be caught short-staffed.
“I know that the city is going to see a surge in demand for hospitality talent,” said McAfee-Bryant. “So what’s the plan to make sure that Kansas Citians reap the benefit of that surge?”
Despite regional cooperation to address transportation, infrastructure, public safety and small-business readiness ahead of the World Cup, there’s currently no formal citywide or regional plan to address a potential boom in demand for hospitality workers.
“I really worry that we’re not going to put our best face forward when the entire world is watching, and that’s scary,” Tosatto said.
 Scale of the World Cup challenge

The World Cup dwarfs every major event Kansas City has hosted.
The 2026 World Cup is expected to be the largest sporting event in history with an expanded field of 48 countries playing 104 matches in 16 host cities sprinkled across North America. Each match captures Super Bowl-level television ratings worldwide.
The White House said that each of the 16 host cities will see an influx of at least 450,000 visitors and a net potential economic impact of $480 million on average.
A spokesman for KC2026, the regional nonprofit group in charge of area World Cup preparations, said that 650,000 visitors are expected across Kansas and Missouri with a projected economic impact of $650 million.
For comparison, the Big 12 Basketball Tournament brings roughly 100,000 ticketholders to downtown for two weeks and generates $23 million to $33.5 million annually.
Using KC2026’s figures, hosting the World Cup is like having nearly seven Big 12 tournaments at once — and it lasts nearly three times as long.
The closest example in Kansas City is the 2023 NFL Draft, which brought an estimated 302,000 visitors to a concentrated area of the city over three days. The World Cup matches are expected to bring more than twice that amount to the region over the tournament’s 39 days.
 Learning from the past

The 2023 NFL Draft was viewed by some in the local restaurant scene as a dud that failed to live up to expectations for their businesses. Some fear that restaurant owners will hear the World Cup hype and dismiss it, anticipating a repeat of the draft experience.
“We were very — very times a thousand — very, disappointed in our city and how the draft was communicated and marketed to our restaurants,” said Trey Meyers, director of marketing and communications with the Missouri Restaurant Association. “They were lied to, and we were very upset, disappointed, and we raised hell about that.”
He said that restaurants and vendors within the draft’s enclosed physical perimeters and immediate surrounding area saw a substantial boost in sales, but that not all the restaurants in the area saw the increased business that they were promised.
“We’re not going to have that same problem with the World Cup,” said Meyers.
Meyers said his trade group, which represents 12,000 restaurants in the region, has been in communication with City Council members, tourism bureaus and the sports commission. A KC2026 spokesman referred questions around hospitality readiness to the Greater Kansas City Chapter of the Missouri Restaurant Association and Meyers. A spokesman for Kansas City, Missouri, did not respond for comment.
 Rising unemployment 

Meyers said a softening labor market may help resolve the staffing issue heading into the World Cup. He has observed staff reductions and an abundance of applications. Anecdotally, he said that one recently opened restaurant in Olathe, Kansas, saw 92 applications for their staff positions.
“I’d say we aren’t in a hospitality worker shortage,” Meyers said. “I’d say quite the opposite.”
He doesn’t dispute the government statistics or Indeed numbers but offers a different perspective. He said that due to high staff turnover rates in the industry, many employers don’t remove job listings because they are always looking for workers. He also said that the restaurant industry may never fully recover from pandemic job losses. He blames recent staff layoffs on a litany of issues including crime, inflation, third-party delivery charges and other increased operating costs.
“We’ve been having a massive staff overage because of all the layoffs from other industries,”  Meyers said. “Everyone defaults to the hospitality industry just to make ends meet and we’ve always seen ourselves as an industry of opportunity.”
The job market here and across the country is beginning to soften. The Kansas City area unemployment rate, which was just 2.5% in May 2022, crept up to 4% in July 2025. In the same month, the number of job seekers outnumbered job listings nationwide for the first time since April 2021.
Restaurateurs who are worried about the World Cup staffing are fretting about the quality, not just the quantity of workers.
“I am getting a huge percentage of applications coming in from people who have never worked in the industry before at all,” Tosatto said. “We don’t just need to get a body in the building, we need someone with skills, ready to go, that can come in and get going. Those people just really aren’t out there right now.”
 Demand for workers will rise no matter what

Regardless of whether area restaurants are over- or understaffed today,  demand for service industry workers will increase ahead of the World Cup.
Missouri passed legislation allowing businesses to serve alcohol nearly 24/7 during the tournament. Extended hours mean extended staffing needs. Further, Kansas City’s population is 506,032, meaning that if projections are correct, more than a second city full of visitors will swarm the area for more than a month.
Meyers said the exact number of visitors can’t really be estimated until we figure out who’s coming to town when the World Cup draws matchups at random in December.
“It really depends on who’s coming here and who we are catering to,” said Meyers. “If we land a group of major soccer nations like England, Brazil, France and the Netherlands, we’re probably looking at close to a million people here over the 40 days.”
 Opportunity meets economic mobility

McAfee-Bryant said the situation may seem intimidating but it also presents an opportunity. She sees the World Cup as Kansas City’s chance to lift vulnerable residents out of poverty permanently.
“This is an opportunity for Kansas City to intentionally build a more diverse hospitality workforce,” she said. “There’s a lot of people who could really use this uptick in commerce and additional funds in their pocket to get on the path towards economic mobility.”
Her organization, The Prospect KC, runs a 16-week training program combining food service skills with wraparound support services to bring people in the urban core out of chronic poverty and into a more stable hospitality career. The nonprofit operates a community kitchen at 750 The Paseo and a coffee shop in Kansas City’s Central Library that offer on-the-job training.
McAfee-Bryant wants to see community-based recruitment in neighborhoods with high unemployment, taking opportunities directly to residents most affected by unemployment and poverty.
“The city has used the World Cup to attract funding for a lot of other things in the city,” said McAfee-Bryant. “So why can’t we use the same World Cup to attract funding and support to help the city strengthen its workforce development pipeline?”
McAfee-Bryant said her organization has limited space and could only train 100 people at a time. She envisions a group of nonprofits, governments, hotels, restaurants, large employers and hiring managers that come together to coordinate a plan to get at least 1,000 workers trained, ready and secure in a new career.
“It’s not something that one organization could take on all alone,” she said. “Everyone is going to have to come to the table to figure it out.”
While larger hotel and restaurant chains can bring in workers from other cities, McAfee-Bryant and Tosatto would like to see local long-term skilled hospitality workers come out of the World Cup.
Mike Burris, the Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association’s executive director, tends to agree. He acknowledges World Cup staffing concerns but emphasizes quality over quantity of hospitality jobs going forward.
“I want to make sure that when we put people into the industry that we’re not looking for temporary help, but we’re looking for long-term help,” said Burris. “That’s always been an issue in the restaurant business.”
 KC’s reputation at stake

Boosters say the World Cup represents Kansas City’s chance to cement its status as a destination for more international events. The city has invested heavily in preparations like infrastructure and logistics.
But McAfee-Bryant said if the area doesn’t address the supply of hospitality workers, the World Cup in Kansas City will be like a beautiful wedding that has slow service and gross food.
“Poor hospitality is the thing that will ruin this experience for everybody,” McAfee-Bryant said.
The clock is ticking. Kansas City has less than a year to prepare for the biggest food service industry challenge in its history. The reservation for 650,000 is confirmed.
The world will be watching next summer. Visitors to the area will talk about their experience for years. Their reviews could influence Kansas City’s reputation — and its future as a host city — for decades to come.
“What do you think all the people are going to talk about?” McAfee-Bryant asks.

“This has never happened in our country before. We have had periods of voluntary departure, but not self-deportations under pressure like this,” said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
In a June report Chishti wrote for the institute, he said the “self-deportation” strategy by the Trump administration is perhaps an acknowledgement that its goal of 1 million deportations a year “might be impossible through immigration enforcement alone, no matter how muscular.”
Immigration arrests fell in August compared with July and have not been close to a stated administration goal of 3,000 a day.
It’s hard to document how many immigrants might be choosing to leave under pressure from the Trump administration. Thousands have shown a new interest in leaving on social media, in court and through a new government app offering a plane ticket and $1,000 for those without legal immigration status. Trump officials have touted a drop in the immigrant population this year as a sign of success, but researchers say fear of responding to surveys may play a role in the data.

A 22-year-old Oklahoma woman, brought to the U.S. as a child, told Stateline she’s leaving for her native Mexico on a flight this month to start a new life.
Living in Mexico may be hard, but the threat of arrest and detention after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed, giving extra funding for immigration enforcement, was too much for her.
“It’s tough. I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known. I speak Spanish, but not the best. My thoughts are in English. I have to readapt to everything,” she said.
“More than anything, I’m tired of being called a criminal here,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, fearing interference with her flight.
“I was in leadership in high school. I was in the marching band. I have a college degree here. I am not a criminal, and this is not OK, what’s happening now,” said the woman, who said her parents brought her at the age of 6 on a tourist visa.
She didn’t qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, because her family took her on trips back to Mexico, she said, returning on new tourist visas.
“I am 22 years old now and undocumented,” she said, “I can’t speak to my parents’ actions. I know there’s issues with legality in that and they made choices that were not favorable. I was a child.”


I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known.


– A 22-year-old woman brought to the U.S. as a child who’s moving to Mexico


Discussions abound on Reddit, an online chat site, about whether to take a government offer to leave or continue to face the threat of arrest and detention if not deportation.
“After over 20 years of living here illegally (I was brought here as a toddler) I think now is finally the time to throw in the towel. I simply do not belong in the US nor am I wanted here,” one man, who said he was born in Mexico, wrote this month in a chat group for Mexican expatriates.
“I’ve worked in construction a large part of my adult life so I have some money saved up, but no career,” he added. “I just feel tired of not being able to do anything meaningful with my life here. I can’t get a driver’s license. I have no hope of ever retiring when I grow old and I can’t even get a real job.”
The Trump administration is using a “potent combination of carrots and sticks” to encourage immigrants without legal status to leave, according to the Migration Policy Institute report. High-profile arrests at workplaces, homes, court hearings and even citizenship interviews have “generated intense nervousness” while poor conditions in detention centers and the threat of removal to unknown countries create “a palpable fear of arrest,” the report stated.
The Department of Homeland Security has a cellphone app — called CBP Home — that offers a plane ticket and $1,000 to “illegal aliens” wishing to leave. The department told Stateline, in a statement attributed only to a senior official, that “tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app” but did not provide further detail.

Thousands more people have accepted voluntary departure rather than fight immigration court cases and take a chance on arrest and detention. The Pew Research Center found that the overall immigrant population dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million in June, though the change could be due partly to a heightened fear of responding to surveys among immigrants.
In another sign of increased appetite for leaving the country, a social media group helping such people decide has seen soaring membership.
The group, Onward, was started by three DACA recipients who moved abroad during the first Trump administration. It has seen 10,000 join requests this year, more than triple the interest it’s had previously in its four years of existence, said Jason Hong, a founding member. Hong was born in South Korea, brought to the U.S. as a child, grew up in New Jersey, and has opted to live in Spain. There, he is a legal resident and has an opportunity for Spanish citizenship. U.S. citizenship wasn’t an option under DACA.
“If I want to shoot for citizenship here, I can,” Hong said. “For the time being I want to focus on helping others who are making the same decision.”
Another Onward founder, Monsy Hernández, left South Carolina during the first Trump administration in 2017, settling in Germany.
“I was very traumatized with the discrimination I faced in the United States when my mom was put into one of the ICE detention centers. I just wanted to go somewhere where no one knew that I was Mexican,” Hernández said. “I thought, OK, if I’m in Germany, I will be very, very far away from that discrimination.”

Widespread departure of immigrants is almost unprecedented in the U.S. history, Chishti said, though there was a large-scale return of Italian immigrants in the 19th century. They were known in Italy as “ritornati” — a wave of farmers and laborers who arrived here when work was scarce in their home country, then returned home with their savings after a few years, when economic conditions in Italy improved.
More recently, some people from Mexico returned home when work dried up during the 2008 Great Recession.
But the current departures under pressure and threats from the U.S. government seems to be unprecedented, Chishti said. In some cases, parents have been pressured to leave the country or face separation from their children.
Voluntary departure is also an option to settle immigration court cases, and more people are taking that route. In those cases, immigrants must pay their own way and can’t have a conviction for a serious crime. Choosing voluntary departure can get immigrants released from detention and avoid a removal order that could cause them to be permanently barred from returning.
According to federal statistics obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Stateline, 6,118 people were granted voluntary departure between Jan. 20 and July 29, the latest figures available, compared with 2,550 for the same time period last year during the Biden administration. For both years, the majority of cases involved citizens of Mexico returning to Mexico.

Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set the New England region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Zack Porter: America’s roadless areas are under attack. Speak up now..","This commentary is by Zack Porter, of Montpelier. Porter is the executive director of Standing Trees, which works to protect and restore forests on New England’s public lands.


Whether you have enjoyed a hike to a summit in the Green or White mountains, an afternoon fishing on a cold-water trout stream, a postcard-perfect view from a highway overlook or a glass of clean water from your tap, there’s a good chance that a U.S. Forest Service “Inventoried Roadless Area” is to thank. 
On Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green mountain national forests are at risk.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. 
Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green mountain national forests, including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mt. Moosilauke, Mt. Chocorua and the presidential range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were only spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitats and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower 48 states), the agency promoted the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. 
More than 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and wellbeing of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. 
Vermonter Randy Kritkausky, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote, “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”
Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree the state must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the past two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. 
In the Green Mountain National Forest, a single project approved in 2019 is set to cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new White Mountain National Forest project proposes nearly 1,000 acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025, which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
The act is an essential step to stopping President Donald Trump’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule. Take a stand today by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. … The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

(Courtesy Will Berry)I was 11 years old in 1997 when Geoffrey West shot and killed my mother, Margaret Parrish Berry, while robbing the Attalla gas station where she worked. Mr. West was sentenced to death for killing my mother. His execution date is set for September 25. But I do not want the state of Alabama to kill him. That won’t bring my mother back; it will only add to the pain I have lived with since the night she was shot. I believe there is a better way.
My mother was the person I loved most in the world. Her absence, and the senseless way she died, has cast a long shadow over my life. Even so, the weeks since I learned that Gov. Ivey set an execution date for Mr. West have been some of the most unsettling I can recall. My dearest wish is to meet with Mr. West. Yet with only weeks left until his execution date, it’s not clear who has the power to make that happen or how to ask them directly.
I was a child when Mr. West took my mother’s life – old enough to understand what had happened but too young to process it. I had no say at the trial, and I’ve had no say since then. No one from the Alabama attorney general’s office called me in April to say they had requested an execution date. No one from the governor’s office called in July when Gov. Ivey set it. If my wife hadn’t stumbled across an article on Facebook, I’m not sure when I would have learned.
I believe in the teachings of Jesus and in His words on the Mount, “For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins” (Matthew 6:14-15). My faith teaches that every trial we endure brings us closer to salvation. It teaches submission to God’s will.
I believe that in seeking to execute Mr. West, the state of Alabama is playing God. I don’t want anyone to exact revenge in my name, nor in my mother’s. I believe life without the possibility of parole is just punishment. I believe there is an ending to this story where Mr. West and I find comfort in each other and in the healing power of forgiveness.
I want to tell Mr. West that I forgive him. And I want to ask questions, both about what happened that night and about who he is as a man. In some ways, I suppose I just want to be in a room with him. Through his legal team, Mr. West has agreed to my request. Even in what may be the last weeks of his life, he is willing to spend time with me and reckon with the harm he caused. I believe that speaks well of him, despite the deadly mistake he made the night he killed my mother. I know that she forgives him and that she would want me to sit down with him.










The criminal justice system is not built with victims’ needs, wishes, and well-being in mind. I know that as well as anybody, because what is being done in my name is not what I need or want.


The criminal justice system is not built with victims’ needs, wishes, and well-being in mind. I know that as well as anybody, because what is being done in my name is not what I need or want. I know that clemency is a lot to ask for. But having spoken with a restorative justice specialist who is also in communication with Mr. West, I feel hopeful there could be a future where he and I might sit down together. Where we might pray together.
But time is working against us. Whether or not she can see her way to granting clemency, at the very least I hope Gov. Ivey will grant a reprieve, which she has the authority to do. That time would allow Mr. West, his family, and mine to engage in vital healing conversations. I need time to heal.
I have observed the process around other executions in Alabama. I know the attorney general would welcome me at Holman Prison to watch as Mr. West is killed. I know I would be invited to speak at a press conference afterward. But that is not what I want. When I go to Holman, I want to speak with Mr. West heart to heart. I want to tell him I forgive him, that my mother forgives him, and that God loves him.
My life has been very hard. I hope that Gov. Ivey will see her way to granting me this measure of comfort, and I pray that she will find it in herself to spare Mr. West’s life.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Will-and-Margaret-Berry-for-Sept-9-2025-commentary.jpg,,,2025-09-11 07:56:26.638185

Indiana’s chronic absenteeism rate dropped to 16.7% in the most recent 2024-25 school year — marking the third straight year of improvement.

The rate, which measures students missing at least 10% of school days in a single academic year, is down 1.1 percentage points from last year and more than four points since 2022, when it topped 21%.
“The data is clear. Regular student attendance is vital to ensuring more students master foundational literacy and numeracy skills and graduate high school prepared for their next step,” Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said Wednesday. “Statewide chronic absenteeism rates continue to move in the right direction … but we know there is still more to be done.”
The Indiana Code specifically defines chronic absenteeism as missing at least 10% of instructional days in a school year for any reason, regardless of whether it is excused. That’s equal to about 18 absences per school year. Separately, “habitual truancy” is used to define students who miss 10 or more days without any excuse.
Jenner told board members that many chronically absent students are typically absent for more than a month, however.
“It’s not just that they hit the 18 days — it’s much beyond that,” she said.
John Keller, with the Indiana Department of Education, called the attendance numbers “a good sign” but additionally emphasized that “we have more work to do.”
 Broad attendance improvements
Student absences have been on the rise since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indiana and across the nation. Chronic absenteeism surged during the pandemic, nearly doubling to peak at 21.1% in 2022, according to IDOE.
Rates have declined in recent years, though: 21.1% in 2022; 19.2% in 2023; and 17.8% in 2024.
The latest numbers show that during the 2024-25 academic year, chronic absenteeism fell across all grade levels. Nearly 800 schools reported rates under 10% in 2025 — up from fewer than 700 the year before, according to the new data.
But 78 schools still had more than half their students chronically absent, and rates remained highest among high schoolers.
Nearly one in three Indiana seniors — 31.6% — were chronically absent, compared with 23.1% of juniors and 20.6% of sophomores.
Attendance improved across demographics as well. Absenteeism among Black students dropped by 1.6 percentage points, and by 1.2 points among Hispanic students.
The chronic absenteeism rate for students receiving free or reduced-price meals similarly dropped by 1.7 percentage points. The share of English learners considered chronically absent also fell for the third consecutive year, this time down to 17.8%.
“We’re seeing the improvements … crossing all demographics, all types of students,” Keller said.
Story continues below:
2024-2025-Chronic-Absenteeism-Data-1
 
But officials said the academic consequences of ongoing chronic absenteeism remain. Keller warned that for some students, the problem compounds.
“There are some students whose absences can actually be measured in months and years, not just in a single school year, and that becomes a big challenge,” Keller continued.
IDOE’s data showed chronically absent third-graders had a 74% IREAD pass rate in 2025, compared to 89% of their peers who attended more regularly. In English and math proficiency, the gaps were more than 20 points. 
“When you miss a month of school, that’s going to show up somewhere else, and where it’s showing up is in student outcomes,” Keller said. “Outcomes matter and are impacted, at least correlated to attendance.”
Indiana’s attendance laws
A new law, Senate Enrolled Act 482, took effect July 1 to level set attendance definitions in statute and standardize statewide reporting.
Even so, school districts still largely determine where absences fall within three official categories:

Excused absences include illness with a note, funerals, religious observances, college visits, court appearances, and other reasons permitted by district policy. Schools set their own specific policies but must document these absences with appropriate verification, per IDOE guidelines.
Unexcused absences include skipping school, family vacations not approved in advance, or failing to provide documentation for otherwise excusable reasons. These absences count toward truancy thresholds and may trigger attendance interventions.
Exempt absences are those required or protected by state or federal law and do not count against a student’s attendance record. These include jury duty, election service, military obligations, foster care court proceedings, or serving as a legislative page. House Enrolled Act 1660, passed during the 2025 session, further excuses student absences for participation in educational events organized by Future Farmers of America or 4-H.

If a student is expected to miss at least 20 instructional days in a school year due to a medical condition or injury, Indiana law additionally requires the school to provide instruction — but only if a parent submits documentation from a licensed healthcare provider. Schools use that information to develop an educational plan for the student.
What Indiana’s new absenteeism law actually does — and doesn’t do — to attendance policies

If a student has a documented disability, the team responsible for Individualized Education Programs – IEPs — determines how services should be provided during absences.
State statute requires superintendents or attendance officers to report a student who is habitually absent from school to the local prosecuting attorney. Prosecuting attorneys must then notify parents if an affidavit of habitual truancy is filed with their office.
The new law allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken, but they’re not required to do so.
A parent meeting also isn’t required for students with excused absences, and county prosecutors are not notified about a student’s absence if they are excused.
Until July 1, 2026, K-8 students also can’t be expelled “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant.” After that date, however, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.

He credits the format to recurring New York Times feature called “Routine” that asks people how they spend their time. 
I found out I was on lockdown while I was in segregation. I had been expecting to come out of my cell for my hour of rec time, but 10 other prisoners in the segregation wing and I were told that the entire facility was on lockdown and nobody was coming out. We faced a double lockdown because we were already isolated and sectioned off on lockdown status, away from the rest of the population.
I will be off lockdown whenever the administration decides. As of now, they haven’t given us a specific date, and I’m under the impression that this will be a more permanent schedule. 
Family. My family finds out I’m on lockdown when I go more than three days without any communication. They then call the prison and verify my status.
How often. I am usually on lockdown three to five times per month. The lockdowns usually last two to three days. The longest I have been on lockdown (apart from the 2020 COVID-19 year) is three months. This was in 2018 when officer Joseph Gomm died.
Worst part. The worst thing about lockdown is the absence of any opportunity to contact and communicate with my loved ones. I really wish I could call them while I’m locked in my cell.
Entertainment. When I am on lockdown, I like to catch up on my reading, get some extra hours of sleep, and meditate to pass time.
Eating. During lockdown, I get three meals a day. They are almost always cold. A typical meal on lockdown is cold cereal and an English muffin for breakfast; cold pasta salad for lunch; and a halfway thawed-out bologna bag lunch for dinner.
Excercise. If I want to exercise during lockdown, I have to do it in my cell, with the little space that I’m afforded.
Bathing. The only bathing option is to wash up in a small metal sink connected to my toilet.
Emergency. If there were an emergency during lockdown, I would have to hope that a response comes in a timely manner. But more than likely, I would probably write my last words and a will.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbed-wire.jpg,,,2025-09-11 07:56:26.638185

In Chittenden County, the median sale price of a primary home reached $500,000 last year.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Vermont’s Covid-era home-buying frenzy — marked by an extremely tight supply of available homes and sight-unseen offers — has now eased somewhat.
“I think that the balancing of the marketplace is kind of starting to occur,” said Peter Tucker, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Realtors.
An uptick in real estate listings and home sales show that the market has loosened. Fierce bidding wars are less common than they were just a few years ago, realtors say, and for-sale signs are a more common sight in many neighborhoods. Yet home prices continue to rise.
In 2024, the statewide median sale price for a primary home was about $353,000 — a 9% jump from the prior year. That’s according to state property transfer tax records collected by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, which weeds out seasonal or occasional-use homes.
Preliminary data for the first half of 2025 shows that prices have continued to escalate this year. The median sale price had risen to about $370,000 as of June, according to Maura Collins, VHFA’s executive director.
That metric varies widely across the state. In 2024, the median sale price for a primary home in the state’s poorest and most rural county — Essex — was $200,000. In Chittenden County, Vermont’s population and job center, the median sale price reached $500,000 last year.
During the hot market of the pandemic years, home prices shot up while the number of homes sold plummeted. The rate of home sales now appears to have reversed course. In 2024, 9% more homes were sold than during the year prior, according to the state tax data.
The volume of sales appears to be stabilizing thus far in 2025, though different data sources paint slightly different pictures of the market. The state tax data shows a modest drop in the number of primary home sales during the first half of 2025 versus the first half of 2024. Slightly more current data on all single family home and condo sales collected by the Realtors’ association shows a 2.2% rise in homes sold as of August compared to the same period last year. The number of home listings has also jumped over 8% as of August, according to the Realtors’ association.
It’s still a seller’s market, and inventory remains well below pre-pandemic levels. But now, buyers have more options, said Brian Boardman, a real estate agent and co-owner of Burlington-based Coldwell Banker Hickok and Boardman. 
During the tight Covid years between 2021 and 2023, an agent could show a potential buyer maybe one or two homes within their given price range in Chittenden County, Boardman said. “Now, those buyers have, you know, maybe six or seven choices, or more — and so they can get more of their wish list.” 
A number of factors could be driving more people to sell their homes. Some homeowners may have been waiting for the pandemic to ease before retiring or moving closer to family, said Tucker, from the Realtors’ association. Some may have been waiting for interest rates to lower. The entrance of newly-constructed homes into the market has helped somewhat, said Boardman. 
There’s also a domino effect once inventory starts to open up, Boardman said. 
“The people that are in the family homes for 30 or 40 years are going to go to a retirement home, which opens up their house, which gets the young family out of a rental or maybe a two-bedroom condo,” which they can then put on the market, he said.
So why are home prices continuing to rise steeply even as more homes are selling? Collins, from the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, sees that as an indication that Vermont needs to continue building more homes to fill its deep deficit. The state is far from reaching a glut that would drag home values down, she said.
“Our goal is not to depress home values, but to slow the ever-increasing sales prices,” said Collins, who serves on the board of the pro-housing lobbying group Let’s Build Homes. “Even with more homes selling in 2024 than 2023 and even with more homes being listed for sale this summer than last summer, we don’t see that home prices are yet lowering,” she said.
Homes are also still selling quickly during the peak summer season, according to real estate data. That’s one sign that demand remains high.
Data on rentals in Vermont tends to be geographically patchy and outdated. But a recent survey of apartments in the state’s largest rental market — Chittenden County — shows that the razor-thin rental vacancy rate of the Covid-era years has begun to ease, according to Brad Minor, a partner at Allen, Brooks & Minor, a real estate appraisal and analytics firm in South Burlington.
As of June, the area’s rental vacancy rate had risen to 3% — up from under 1%, where it had hovered for over a year beginning in December 2021, Minor said. 
That easing is likely tied to the elimination of Covid-era eviction restrictions and rental assistance, but it is also likely the result of new apartments going online, Minor said. In 2024, his firm identified 824 new apartments built in Chittenden County — more than twice the annual rate of building in any given year for the past two decades.
The firm has yet to tabulate how much average rents have changed in the area in 2025, though Minor said that now some landlords of higher-priced rentals with more vacancies are considering making price cuts to attract tenants.
“It’s possible that we may see maybe less dramatic rent increases, because we’re appearing to move towards a state of balance,” he said.

(Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor)It might seem like New Jersey’s controversial ban on guns applies “nearly everywhere that ordinary human action occurs,” as U.S. Circuit Court Judge David J. Porter groused in his dissent of his colleagues’ decision Wednesday to uphold the contested restrictions.
But gun owners with carry permits can take their firearms to a short list of locations — at least until some future judge intervenes in the legal battle that started just after Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law in December 2022. Gun-rights groups have said they will continue fighting to get the restrictions struck down permanently.
So where can gun owners who are licensed to carry take their guns? They can carry in private vehicles and on private property that’s open to the public, such as homes and businesses, with property owners’ permission. They can also carry while hunting and fishing.
The 2022 law makes it a third-degree crime, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, to take guns into 25 so-called sensitive spaces. Gun owners cannot carry guns into these places in New Jersey:

Zoos
Parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, and beaches
Youth sporting events
Public libraries and museums
Bars and other places that serve alcohol
Arenas, stadiums, theaters, theme parks, racetracks, and other entertainment facilities
Casinos
Airports, transit hubs, and public transportation
Within 100 feet of public gatherings
Hospitals, outpatient clinics, medical treatment centers, nursing homes, group homes, and health care offices
Schools, day cares, camps, school buses, and colleges and universities
Churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship
Private homes and businesses not open to the public (unless the owner allows it)
Correctional facilities and halfway houses
Shelters for people experiencing homelessness or recovering from domestic violence
Cannabis retailers and dispensaries
Movie sets
Power plants

Guns already were banned in courthouses, polling places, government buildings, and legislative assemblies.
Federal law also forbids guns, even with a permit, at federal courthouses, buildings, prisons, cemeteries, military bases (except for military personnel), post offices, buildings in national parks and forests, and Native American reservations, plus on Amtrak trains and ferries to national monuments.

With the general elections over a year away, current lawmakers started working towards their goal over the summer — endorsing their preferred candidates and working with them to boost their messages and critiques of Republican incumbents. 
But the strategy has ruffled feathers with some announced and potential candidates, who say lawmakers discouraged them from running and are acting as though party “insiders” should be able to determine who represents local communities.
November 2026 will be the first time legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be in effect for the 17 odd-numbered Senate seats up for election. Democrats were able to cut the Republican majority from 22 seats to 18 seats in 2024. They will need to win two additional seats to take the majority in 2026. 
There are three seats on Democrats’ target list: Senate District 5, currently held by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), Senate District 17, currently held by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), and Senate District 22, currently held by Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine). Democrats are also looking to hold Senate District 31, currently represented by Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick). 
After the new state budget was signed in early July, Democrats immediately turned their attention to the elections. Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and other members of the Senate Democratic caucus showed up for a pair of campaign announcements in July. 
Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon) announced her challenge to Marklein, and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) launched her campaign challenging Hutton. The announcements were boosted by the Wisconsin State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee (SSDC), which is the lawmakers’ political arm that works to help Democrats win elections.
“One of the reasons why senators are getting involved with these candidates that are running is because we’ve known them for years,” Hesselbein said, recalling that she first met Jacobson in 2017 while she was serving on the village of Oregon Board of Trustees. “I was really excited about her candidacy.”

Hesselbein told the Examiner in July that the endorsements are not coming from the party.
“It’s senators that know the content of the character of Jenna Jacobson and Robin Vining,” Hesselbein said. “That’s why we’re supporting them. We know that if there’s going to be a primary, there’ll be a primary.”
Hesselbein said she spoke with all of the people who were considering running to let them know what she was thinking. She said it was important to her that people know where she stood, mentioning that when she ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly in 2010, a late endorsement took her by surprise.
“I wish I would have known at the beginning what they were going to do. I’ve always been very extremely honest and forthright with everybody,” Hesselbein said. “They might be upset that I chose a candidate, but they certainly know the reasons why, and we had a conversation about it.”
Senate District 17 
For the last decade, Marklein has represented Senate District 17 — winning three elections easily and serving as the chair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee since 2021.  
Lafayette County Democratic Party Chair Nancy Fisker said her community is looking for someone who will represent the values and needs of rural Wisconsin and the task of beating Marklein, who tends to vote along party lines, will be hard. 
“He’s a great politician. He has a really great ground game. He’s been in office long enough that he has people in place who will put him in the right place at the right time,” Fisker said. “He’s very sociable, and people love that.”
Marklein won SD 17 with 60% of the vote in 2022. Under the new maps, however, the district is more competitive. An analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, found the district leaned Democratic by 1 percentage point in the 2024 presidential election and by over 4 percentage points in the 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
Marklein hasn’t announced whether he will run for reelection yet. In July, he reported raising over $69,000. 
Fisker said the new maps have led to renewed excitement around these races. That excitement can be seen, she said, in the number of people who have shown interest in running, which was as many as seven people at one point. 
The first candidate to enter the race was Lisa White, a Potosi businesswoman and grandmother. She said she’s been concerned about cuts to Medicaid by the Trump administration as well as women’s and rural health care in general.
“My determination is to represent the southwestern portion of our state, which has not happened for decades,” White told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “I feel I’m the singular voice in that pool of people who can truly, truly represent the entire district, and not just the Madison area.” 
White also said she wants to see an end to the private school voucher program in Wisconsin.
Corrine Hendrickson, a well-known child care advocate, is also planning to enter the race for the seat and launch her campaign later this month. 
Hendrickson told the Examiner in an interview that the recent budget process pushed her to consider running. The budget’s investment in child care did not meet what many child care advocates, including Hendrickson, said was necessary to help keep them afloat. Hendrickson also recently made the decision to close her own family child care program.
“We’re talking to the representatives. We’re inviting them in. We’re showing them our books… and it’s not enough, and so to me, that means that our representatives truly aren’t listening, and they’re just really moving the goal posts so that they have an excuse not to invest in child care,” Hendrickson said. 
Hendrickson said she was excited when she learned so many people were considering running in the race.
“We’ve had to beg people to run against this man in the past,” Hendrickson said, adding that knowing there were others weighing running made her consider, “Am I the best person? What makes me the best person?” 
“Really, the only way to find that out is to go through the process,” Hendrickson said.
With so many potential candidates, Fisker said county parties across the district decided they would host forums for those considering a run. 
County Democratic parties in Wisconsin usually do not endorse candidates in primaries, Fisker said.
“It’s always been very difficult to get people to run. People just aren’t interested in running for a variety of reasons. So this year we started looking around like we always do, and you know, we had seven people who raised their hand and said, ‘I think I’m interested, but I want to look into it a little further,’” Fisker said. “We were amazed.”
It’s not entirely unheard of for the state party to make endorsements ahead of primaries, especially when an incumbent is running for reelection. During the 2025 primary for the state superintendent, for example, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin endorsed state Superintendent Jill Underly for a second term.
Fisker noted the SSDC has nothing to do with the state party, and she said it was clear early that the sitting senators were planning to endorse a candidate.
“We thought we really had convinced them to wait,” Fisker said. “All it would have taken was them to wait for three or four months. We’re way out here from the election, and you know, the candidates would have self-selected at some point.”
Jacobson, surrounded by five Democratic senators, launched her candidacy the Monday after Gov. Tony Ever signed the new state budget, — just a few days ahead of any county party forums taking place.
Hendrickson said she received a heads up from Hesselbein that she would be endorsing Jacobson and the top Senate Democrat encouraged her to run for the Assembly instead. Hendrickson said she felt the decision for Jacobson to announce alongside the senators just ahead of the forums being held “was a move to pressure us to back up.”
“They’re not voters. They don’t live in this district,” Hendrickson said of the lawmakers. “This district is hungry for a candidate that’s from the area, that understands the deep rural part of this district and how hard we’re all struggling as communities because of the state budget and because of the decisions that Marklein’s making as the co-chair of the JFC.”

Matt Raobin, owner of Brix Cider in Mount Horeb has decided against running for personal reasons, he said, but he described a similar experience in a Facebook post, saying that he reached out to members of the SSDC as he was considering a run.
“In that meeting, it quickly became clear that these are the people who choose the candidate, for better or worse. “We want to avoid a primary,” I heard repeated multiple times,” Raobin wrote, adding that he understood the desire to avoid a primary but also found it problematic. 
“We are in a moment when the Democratic Party needs to reinvent itself. Approval ratings are low. Nationally, we’re taking beating after beating from a Republican trifecta and a hard right Supreme Court. The last thing the Democratic Party should be doing is taking steps to block out new voices from having a chance to be heard,” Raobin wrote. “Avoiding a primary means avoiding the hard work of renewal. It stifles creativity. It squashes out new ideas before they’ve had a chance to grow. It prevents us from testing a candidate’s true viability, and it heavily favors insiders over outsiders.”
The county parties pushed ahead with the forums, giving candidates and potential candidates a chance to introduce themselves to answer questions from the community. 
“I’ve really not seen anything quite like this… we had people from six different counties who came to our forum in Hazel Green,” Fisker said. “It’s been really interesting and fun to see how much people want this… This is what democracy looks like. It should be up to them whether they want to run or not, and then, and then it’s up to us as voters to get out and vote for them in the primary and make our choice.”
White, who is continuing her campaign, said she understands that she is the “underdog” in the race, but thinks it will be worth it no matter the outcome. She said she hopes she is informing people along the way about the issues faced by  the district. 
“There’s no way I can lose if you look at the big picture,” White said. “How can you lose when you are bringing people in… that would have ordinarily tuned out.”
Senate District 5
In the southeast corner of the state, a similar situation has taken shape in Senate District 5. 
The district has been represented by Hutton since 2022 but has changed since the last time he ran. It’s a purple district that represents portions of Milwaukee County, including West Allis and Wauwatosa, and Waukesha County, including Pewaukee, Brookfield and Elm Grove.
Weeks before Vining’s announcement, Brookfield businesswoman Sarah Harrison became the first to enter the race.
Harrison told the Wisconsin Examiner she was encouraged by people in her community to run for the seat — some even reached out to make sure she was still running after Vining’s announcement. She said there is excitement about the race for the 5th Senate District because it appears winnable for Democrats. 
The self-described “data geek” said that as she considered whether to run, she looked at where Democrats had the strongest performances in the past and areas where Democrats could pick up votes and Democrats could grow more in parts of the district that cover Waukesha County. She said her strong “grassroots ties” there would help her connect with voters in areas that have long been represented by Republicans. She said she also brings her experience as a single mom, a business owner and someone who has worked with Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 companies.
“I still believe that I’m the best candidate for this seat,” Harrison said. Waukesha County residents, she said, “have been underrepresented for so long.”
Vining currently represents a third of the district in the Assembly. The other two Assembly districts are represented by Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee) and Rep. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis).
Hutton hasn’t announced whether he’ll run again. He has raised over $5,600 this year, according to his July 2025 report, and has about $89,770 on hand. Campaign filings from July 2025 showed that Vining had raised about $3,000 from January through June and had about $22,000 on hand. Harrison had raised a little over $2,100. 
Harrison said she felt heard in her initial conversations with the SSDC about running, but that it soon became clear that there wasn’t anything she could do to earn the support of the lawmakers. She said primaries should be about vetting the “best candidates and the best ideas.” 
“We fought to end the gerrymandered maps so that voters could choose their representatives, and I respect that the SSDC wants to have a say,” Harrison said. “I won’t let that stop me from running. I’m a fighter.”
Harrison has run for office, running in 2022 for the Assembly in the seat once held by Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, who is now the first Democrat to announce a campaign for governor. She pulled in 43% of the vote in the Republican-leaning seat. 
“It was drawn to be essentially unwinnable,” Harrison said. 
Michalski lost his reelection bid in 2024 to Vining. When Vining made her own pitch for her Senate candidacy in July, she underscored her record of winning competitive races.
In 2024 with new legislative maps in place, Harrison ran for the Assembly again, this time against Rep. Adam Neylon of Pewaukee. She brought in 41% against the incumbent.
“I took on the work and the labor, and I ran two really good campaigns that were beneficial to folks up the ticket, beneficial to the communities. I did all of that at my own cost, in terms of money and time. I had some support from the party, but not a lot.” Harrison said. “To turn around and make this endorsement, it was disappointing.” 
Harrison, who runs a data consulting company, said some of her top issues include ensuring local governments have sufficient funding and that people have access to affordable and accessible child care.
“We’re seeing that folks are hit hard by the need for local referendums because the state has not fully funded a lot of the things they’re requiring,” Harrison said, adding the 2023 law, which updated the way local governments received their shared revenue payment, was just “a toe in the right direction.”
When it comes to health and child care, she said “both of those impact working families and their ability to participate in the economy and to build a better life for their families.” 
She said she would also want the state to accept the Medicaid expansion and work towards “making sure that folks are able to be seen [by a doctor] in a timely manner.” However, she acknowledged the new obstacles that will exist to making those changes under the Trump administration.
“I’m very concerned, especially with some of the changes at the national level that we at the state level are going to have to provide more of a safety net,” Harrison said. 
As she continues her campaign, she has been doing “walk and talks,” getting out in the community to find out what’s on the minds of residents. 
“A lot of people do not want an anointed candidate that was chosen, kind of, by folks who are seen as being insiders. They want to make that choice. They want to have that primary to vet the best candidate. They don’t want a candidate handed to them.”
“It absolutely does make it more challenging for me,” Harrison said of the senators’ involvement. “But it also shows that I’m not someone who’s going to be a yes man. I am going to stand up for what I believe is correct.”

There’s “a longstanding pattern of misconduct by male correctional officers at the WWC,” the lawsuit alleges. 
The post Wyoming Women’s Center inmate sues prison staff, leadership over sexual assault appeared first on WyoFile .","In the last five years, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk have been convicted of sexually assaulting female inmates.
One of those women is now suing in federal court, arguing that the sexual violence she experienced was the result of “deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of inmates” by the prison’s staff and leadership. 
The lawsuit — filed in Wyoming’s U.S. District Court in August — names Joseph Gaul, a former correctional officer, alongside WWC Warden Timothy Lang and Deputy Warden Robert Hardy. Five John Does are also listed as defendants whom the plaintiff could not name but believes were WWC employees. 
In 2023, Gaul admitted to inappropriate sexual contact with the plaintiff, Chasity Jacobs. Soon thereafter, he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and was sentenced to two to five years in prison. 
Before he was hired to work at the Women’s Center in 2019, Gaul was terminated from at least two public-sector jobs in Nebraska due to misconduct toward women, according to the lawsuit. 
In 2019, while serving as the director of the Scotts Bluff County Detention Center in Nebraska, Gaul was placed on administrative leave and subsequently fired for sending sexually explicit text messages to a female subordinate, the complaint states. 
While the Scottsbluff Star-Herald reported on Gaul’s dismissal at the time, the reason for his termination wasn’t made public after county commissioners met in closed session. 
Before his time at the Nebraska detention center, Gaul was also fired from the Nebraska Health and Human Services for inappropriate interactions with female colleagues and sexually inappropriate comments, according to the lawsuit. 
The Wyoming Department of Corrections is required to conduct background and reference checks before hiring any correctional officer.
But when it came to Gaul’s hiring, the lawsuit alleges “these requirements were either ignored or improperly conducted.”
The Wyoming Department of Corrections declined WyoFile’s request for comment, citing its policy not to comment on pending litigation.

The lawsuit also argues that Gaul’s conduct was not an isolated incident, “but part of a longstanding pattern of misconduct by male correctional officers at the WWC.”
It points to two other former guards who were convicted of sexual assault of an inmate — one in 2020, another earlier this year. 
“The pervasive problem of sexual assault by WWC correctional officers was well known to prison administrators including, specifically, Defendants Lang and Hardy,” according to the lawsuit. “Despite this, Defendant Lang, and other supervisory personnel failed to implement safeguards or address the systematic breakdowns in hiring, training, reporting, or accountability that enabled repeated sexual abuse.” 
Details
Jacobs was arrested on felony charges when she was 19 years old and began serving a 25-to-35-year sentence in Lusk in 2020, according to the lawsuit. 
In 2023, she was segregated from the main prison population and employed as a janitorial worker with restricted movement. It was during this time that she often encountered Gaul in unsupervised areas. 
“Gaul used his position of authority to cultivate familiarity with inmates,” including the plaintiff, according to the lawsuit. “He routinely overshared personal information, including details about his failing marriage, and offered special privileges to select inmates.”
In July 2023, while Jacobs was performing cleaning duties, Gaul isolated her in a chemical closet where he raped her, according to the complaint. 
The plaintiff, “who is substantially smaller than Defendant Gaul, was physically overpowered, frightened, and unable to resist. She froze in fear and was unable to cry out or escape,” the lawsuit states. 
Shortly after the assault, according to the lawsuit, another inmate overheard Gaul ask Jacobs, “Did I cum in you?”
About one week later, Gaul assaulted Jacobs for the second time in a different unsupervised area of the prison. 
Wyoming Department of Corrections internal affairs and the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation began a formal investigation on Aug. 3, 2023, when Gaul was reported. 
Gaul had a duty to protect the plaintiff, the lawsuit states, but he “utterly failed” and his conduct “constitutes excessive force and cruel and unusual punishment in violation” of Jacobs’ constitutional rights. 
Furthermore, Gaul’s violent conduct was part of a pattern, the lawsuit argues. 
“Multiple sexual assaults have been investigated internally by WDOC rather than immediately referred to outside law enforcement, undermining accountability and potentially concealing the full scope of abuse,” the filing states. “Investigations are often incomplete, shielded by internal review procedures, and rarely result in systematic reform or staff discipline beyond the individual perpetrator.” 
The complaint points to Kyle Broberg, a former correctional officer, who was convicted in 2020 of sexually abusing an inmate in secluded areas of the WWC, as well as Kenneth Jensen, a former supervisory correctional officer. 
“Jensen was tasked with overseeing an inmate maintenance crew. While in this supervisory role, Jensen systematically manipulated, groomed, and sexually abused an inmate in September 2024. 
The three recent prosecutions and convictions are likely an undercount, the lawsuit alleges.

Wyoming's largest electric utility, PacifiCorp and its subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power, sued state regulators for discounting expenses it wanted to pass on to ratepayers.
The post Court sides with Wyoming utility, rules state should have allowed higher rate increase appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal judge has ruled in favor of PacifiCorp and its subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power in a case that could tap the electric utility’s Wyoming customers for yet more money.
For how much is unclear, and one party involved in the case told WyoFile an appeal is under consideration.
The lawsuit, which PacifiCorp launched against the Wyoming Public Service Commission last year, strikes at the heart of a long simmering suspicion among state leaders that the utility giant is trying to shift too much of its rising costs to maintain a regional power system to its Cowboy State customers. 
That’s not necessarily the case, at least when it comes to a particular calculation and modeling tool related to Rocky Mountain Power’s 2023 rate hike, according to an order handed down Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Kelly H. Rankin.
As a result of the 2023 rate case, which spurred contentious public meetings, the utility’s Wyoming customers saw a 5.5% general rate hike increase in January 2024, in addition to a pair of temporary upward fuel cost adjustments. Earlier this year, the commission accepted a settlement agreement struck between Rocky Mountain Power and the Wyoming Office of Consumer Advocate to increase rates by about $85.5 million, or 10.2%.

The Oregon company, which is the largest utility operating in Wyoming, named Wyoming Public Service Commissioners Mary Throne (who has since left the commission), Christopher Petrie and Michael Robinson as defendants, according to its complaint. And it gets wonky.
The lawsuit centers on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s authority to require utilities with multistate electric transmission (powerlines) to “hold a certain portion of their energy generating capacity in reserve.” It’s part of a requirement to allow third-party access to interstate transmission lines, and it’s intended to maintain reliable electric service via multiple parties, according to FERC.
That comes at a cost for a utility subject to the federal regulations, according to PacifiCorp. 
To estimate and forecast the cost — the portion that is “just and reasonable” to pass on to ratepayers in a particular state — PacifiCorp and Rocky Mountain Power used an Aurora modeling tool. But the Wyoming Public Service Commission has repeatedly objected to that particular modeling, and reduced how much it allowed the utility to raise its rates in the company’s 2023 rate hike case, based on its objection.
When the commission devalued the utility’s calculation, it unfairly reduced how much PacifiCorp and Rocky Mountain Power was legally allowed to recover, according to this week’s court order.
“Further, it is quite clear from the parties’ filings that the issue regarding trapped costs will continue to rear its head,” Rankin wrote.
Rankin’s order denied a request by the defendants to dismiss, and granted PacifiCorp’s request for a summary judgement, asserting the facts of the case are not in dispute.
The order may be appealed.

EPA's proposed reversal of the “endangerment finding” threatens Wyoming's way of life and economy, writes guest columnist Shana Tarter. 
The post Clean air is essential to Wyoming’s outdoor recreation and tourism industry appeared first on WyoFile .","There are fears I hear over and over from outdoor industry leaders.
“I don’t know how to safely run my business anymore. Each season, the air gets worse, and everything I read makes me worry more about how wildfire smoke harms my staff and participants. What happens to me if I can no longer bring people into the mountains?” 

Opinion

I’ve spent most of my professional life managing risk in the wilderness. For three decades, I trained outdoor leaders to navigate hazards and respond to sudden illness or injury. But in recent years, the conversation has shifted to worries about extreme heat, super-charged weather events, old diseases in new places, and, most crucially, poor air quality. When I present on building climate resilience for the outdoor industry, I’m flooded with variations of the worries above. These are not distant hypotheticals. Wildfire smoke, heat waves and polluted air are already reshaping the outdoor industry. In a recent survey of recreation service providers, 82% reported new impacts from poor air quality compared to just three years ago. 
Many of us grew up after the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970. We take for granted blue skies and breathable air because of its landmark protections. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that greenhouse gases are air pollutants. In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency issued the “endangerment finding,” establishing that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. This finding is the scientific basis for emissions regulations in the U.S. It’s what requires the EPA to protect us from pollution by setting limits on emissions from cars, power plants and industry.
Now, the EPA is proposing to repeal the endangerment finding and eliminate its duty to regulate greenhouse gases. This is a direct attack on public health. It ignores decades of scientific consensus, frees the fossil fuel industry to pollute without accountability, and dismantles critical protections against worsening wildfires, smog and extreme heat.
The evidence that greenhouse gases are bad for us has only grown stronger in recent years. Air pollution has been the number one risk factor for disease worldwide for more than 20 years. In the U.S., oil and gas pollution causes more than 90,000 premature deaths each year and sickens hundreds of thousands more, with communities of color bearing the greatest burden. It contributes to over 10,000 pre-term births annually, 216,000 cases of childhood asthma and more than 1,600 cancer cases every year. Wildfire smoke, a daily stressor for outdoor workers and participants, adds another layer of harm.
For outdoor programs, this is an existential threat. Client safety, staff health and financial viability are already at risk. Will worried parents send their children to camp if they could get sick from the outdoor environment? Will outfitters take participants into the smoky backcountry? Can employers protect their staff or will they face liability for long-term exposure? Without strong protections, outdoor organizations cannot provide safe, reliable experiences, and communities across Wyoming will feel the impact. Outdoor recreation is core to Wyoming’s economy and identity, and protecting clean air protects our way of life.
During four days of testimony in August, more than 600 scientists, health professionals, lawmakers and members of the public urged the EPA not to reverse the endangerment finding. Thousands more have submitted comments. Please add your voice and let the EPA know you will not stand by while they abandon their mission to “protect human health and the environment.”
The EPA is accepting public comments on the proposed repeal until Sept. 22. 
Go to https://www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194 and submit your comment sharing why clean air matters to you, your family, your community and your work.
Clean air is not a luxury. It’s the foundation of Wyoming’s health, outdoor and tourism industries, and our future.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)LINCOLN — State officials will continue to fund Nebraska’s statewide drug disposal program, reversing a midsummer decision not to renew a contract despite legislative funding having been set aside for that purpose.
Lawmakers approved an annual $289,416 appropriation for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to continue contracting for such a program to properly dispose of prescription drugs. It’s the same process that’s been in place for a program the state has at least partially funded since 2015. 
But state officials, as of July 1, refused to renew the contract until this week, effectively freezing the funds.

The state restored funding after the Nebraska Examiner asked DHHS about the cut last week and sought more information from the agency and the Governor’s Office, including why the state cut came without legislative approval and whether DHHS had made any other similar administrative cuts.
“This program is money well spent,” said Haley Pertzborn, CEO of the Nebraska Pharmacists Association, which helps oversee and run the program. “We know it’s heavily utilized by Nebraskans, by communities. It’s a program that honestly runs itself for the most part.”
Elephant in the room
One Hastings pharmacist who has participated in the program since 2016, Katie Trambly, said the state’s decision left her and others in a “holding pattern” and that she was “thrilled” by the reversal.
Trambly said the program had taken a difficult situation for patients who often don’t know what to do with expired or unused medications and made it simpler. She and Pertzborn said the program is particularly helpful to dispose of medications that, if left around, might be targeted for theft or would be particularly toxic to children or pets, including opioids.

Nearly 280,000 pounds of unused medication, or 140 tons, have been disposed of since the program became operational in 2016, according to Amy Holman, project coordinator with the Nebraska Pharmacists Association. That is roughly the size of a blue whale, the largest animal in the world.
The association has also marketed the program’s success by saying the amount of disposed drugs would weigh as much as 16 male African elephants.
The Nebraska program allows people to drop off no longer needed prescription drugs at a participating local pharmacy at no cost to the person dropping off. Meds are then forwarded to Texas to be incinerated.
A hiccup in the program
The Nebraska MEDS Coalition, which consists of community and state partners, including DHHS and the Nebraska State Patrol, helped establish the program in 2016. The effort formed in response to studies by the U.S. Geological Survey and others finding traces of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in U.S. drinking water supplies.
The program has also helped get opioids out of Nebraska homes, with DHHS marketing the program as “every day can be a take-back day in Nebraska.”
In addition to state dollars, the Nebraska Environmental Trust has awarded the program an additional $400,000 annual grant that requires a portion of matching funds. The Trust is funded by Nebraska Lottery proceeds with a goal of funding projects that “conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”

DHHS and state budget officials denied the association’s attempt to renew the contract when the new fiscal year began in July and informed the association of the decision in early August, one month into the fiscal year. That decision inadvertently cut off the Environmental Trust funds, too.
“Drug disposal program costs should be funded by the pharmaceutical and health care industries, not by taxpayers,” Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Gov. Jim Pillen, had told the Nebraska Examiner. “The decision to not spend the appropriation was made after a review of the contract in consideration of an extension beyond the original term.”

Another reason state officials cited for not renewing the contract was the loss of access to federal funding for the program, despite the association having no record of using federal funds.
‘You have to stop everything’
Pertzborn said her team had been proactive in trying to see what would be needed for a contract extension as early as January or February, partly because of the program’s daily use.
Pillen had not targeted the funding for elimination in his latest budget recommendations and did not mention it as a possible cut while lawmakers worked to close a multi-hundred-million-dollar budget shortfall.

Pertzborn said DHHS officials also had repeatedly indicated to her organization that an expected contract renewal was “all good,” so pharmacists continued the program as normal in July.
About a month later, though, in early August, DHHS informed the association that the state budget administrator had denied the contract renewal, leaving Pertzborn and company “alarmed.”
Pertzborn said the association was not “at all” in a position to take on the immediate costs and worked with a network of 270 pharmacies to communicate that pharmacists could no longer order supplies to collect new medications and send them to Texas.
It also meant a pause in a contract between the pharmacists’ association and the local poison control center, which had operated an associated phone line as part of the program.
“You have to stop everything,” Pertzborn told pharmacies. “Use what you have, and we’ll provide you more information as we can.”
The DHHS notification to the association regarding the contract denial said there was a possible appeals process, yet Pertzborn said when her team inquired about how to do so, they learned there was no such process. She said her team was still waiting for documentation that the program had utilized federal funding, too.
Funding restored, contract reconsidered
Over the 10-year lifespan of the program, state lawmakers appropriated nearly $3 million from Nebraska taxpayers. 
DHHS said it used federal funding to replace — not complement — state funding, such as through a targeted opioid drug disposal grant, a state opioid response drug disposal grant and a public health block grant.
A DHHS spokesperson said a total of $100,000 in federal funding had been used over the program’s existence to offset state funding. That federal investment amounts to about 3% of the state investment.
“I understand we have things to cut, I totally understand where they’re coming from,” Pertzborn said. “But I don’t understand cutting something that is so heavily utilized and that is doing a giant service to Nebraska.”

In response to Examiner questions, Strimple confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the state would, following engagement with stakeholders and policymakers, work to extend the contract for this fiscal year, through June 30, 2026.
“This extension will allow for further legislative consideration of this program,” Strimple said.
The move puts the program in the hot seat for the 2026 legislative session as lawmakers are set to address another projected budget shortfall in the middle of a two-year budgeting cycle. Without a change in law, the program would still have at least some dedicated funding through June 30, 2027.
Neither DHHS nor Strimple answered whether the Pillen administration had cut other programs administratively since lawmakers passed the 2025-27 budget in May.
‘A world of difference’
Trambly, director of pharmacy for B&R Stores Inc., which includes Russ’s Market and Super Saver, now oversees 15 pharmacies, including 12 in Nebraska. 
She explained that before the statewide program began, no pharmacy she had worked for had a solid system to dispose of such medications in a healthy way for the community.
Twice-a-year drug take-back programs through the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are helpful, Trambly said. But, she said, that’s “if you catch wind that it’s happening and have the availability to get there that day.”

Pertzborn said the DEA take-back program is also not active in every county and likely misses many Nebraskans. With a daily program, Pertzborn and Tambly said, patients can come at any time a participating pharmacy is open.
“There’s no gray area, it’s black and white. We can take these medications back,” Trambly said.
Trambly said that while she can’t speak to groundwater impacts, she can reflect as a mom of three children on the risk of medications like hormones, narcotics or chemotherapy drugs ending up in the state’s soil or water.
“I’m just really uncomfortable knowing that we wouldn’t be doing anything to prevent that from happening,” Trambly said.
Pertzborn and Trambly said the program also helps grieving families who are sometimes left with medications after a loved one dies. One pharmacy once collected a full trash bag of medicines from one family in such a case, Pertzborn said.
“It makes a world of difference to them and has just been great to be able to provide that to those people,” Trambly said.
Future funding
Multiple lawmakers the Examiner contacted said they weren’t necessarily opposed to the executive branch’s suggestion that pharmaceutical companies pay all or part of the bill. But many said the decision needed to be hashed out, including in the legislative budgeting process.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward was among lawmakers hoping funding could be restored, citing groundwater concerns. She said she was happy to later learn funding would be reestablished.
“As far as who pays for it, that can be discussed, and I’m open to looking for other sources of funding,” Hughes said in a text.
Hughes had successfully worked with the Nebraska Pharmacists Association and Pillen’s team to establish a prescription drug donation program for unexpired medications with Iowa’s SafeNetRx nonprofit. That program launched July 1 despite its own budgetary problems this spring.
The drug disposal and donation programs will both be funded this year, Strimple said.
‘All systems go’: Medicine now flows in Nebraska-Iowa prescription drug donation program

State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said his understanding was that the state had replaced federal funding and that state funding was supposed to be temporary. He noted that it’s unusual for state dollars to replace federal dollars, but in this case, the reverse had happened.
Like Pillen’s team, Clements said he thought pharmaceutical companies profiting from the drugs could contribute to their disposal, similar to how tobacco companies help fund some tobacco prevention programs.
“‘Big Pharma’ could contribute, and they would get some good public relations where they have some negative right now,” Clements said.
While future funding remains an unanswered question, Trambly, Pertzborn and Holman said they are thrilled with the contract reconsideration.
“We are open to any conversations about funding sources and are happy to look at ways that we can adjust the budget for this program going forward,” Holman said Wednesday. “But I think everyone can now see that it is a very important program in Nebraska that people care about and has been very successful for 10 years now.”

(Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun)Ross Dickman and Dan McGurkin know firsthand the difficulty of finding employment and transitioning to civilian life after a career in military service, although their experiences happened about a decade apart. 
Now both men help other veterans and military spouses find employment, including more than 1,200 veterans and spouses in Boise. Last year, the national nonprofit Hire Heroes USA worked with Boise-based Mission43 to connect more than 200 people to jobs in Idaho, and this year the groups are working with nearly 400 veterans around the state.

Dickman is CEO of Hire Heroes USA, which provides one-on-one employment coaching and other services to connect veterans and military spouses with jobs. Dickman works closely with McGurkin, director of Mission43, which provides a range of services to active and former military members and their spouses statewide, including employment, education and engagement events to connect members. 
The nation and Idaho nonprofits started working together around a decade ago, since the inception of Mission43.
“Over the last decade, we’ve found tremendous value in our national employment system plugging in at this local level, where our team members are on the ground, they’re part of this community, they are connected in the events,” Dickman said. “But they also are able to tap into our coaching expertise, our network across the country and really encourage both employers and individuals to think about living, working and making life here in Boise.”
Dickman was visiting Mission43’s headquarters Wednesday at the Idaho Outdoor Fieldhouse in Boise to participate in the 9/11 Miles of Remembrance 5K, scheduled for 5-8 p.m. Thursday, starting at Ann Morrison Park. 
Mission43 launched in 2015 by the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Family Foundation with a goal of making Idaho “the most desirable state for life after the military, and value service,” according to its website. 
 Veterans face unique challenges in employment in Idaho

Dickman joined Hire Heroes USA in 2015 after serving 12 years in the U.S. Army, much of which spent as an AH-64D Apache helicopter pilot. 
McGurkin, a Moscow-native, transitioned out of the military this summer and has been director at Mission43 for about two months. He had been an intelligence officer and infantry officer in the Marine Corps. 
“It is hard to like to come to a place like Idaho and say, ‘all right, I’m here ready to use my skill set,’” McGurkin said. 
Dickman faced a similar challenge, and noted that his metrics of success in the military didn’t have much bearing in the civilian workforce. 
“How many hours, how many missions, how many combat engagements … Those were how we measured effectiveness when I was flying,” he said.

The specialized skills and metrics many veterans leave service with often don’t translate well in an interview. Both organizations are also focused on finding fulfilling careers for servicemembers, often looking for something with upward mobility. 
Dickman said he sees a lot of veterans get put in highly specialized fields that may have matched their training but they get stuck there, with their leadership and other skills remaining under-utilized. He said some of these veterans’ skills would be applicable to a broader range of careers, but the people he works with struggle to articulate how and the employers struggle to understand it. 
“There’s a really positive affinity for veterans and military spouses,” Dickman said, “but doesn’t always necessarily correlate to positive opportunities.” 
Areas around Washington, D.C., with federal and other defense-related industries may offer more opportunities for some veterans with specialized skills, McGurkin said, but there are different kinds of opportunities in Idaho. Mission43 also offers education opportunities, such as programs to obtain certification in project management or cybersecurity.
McGurkin said there is sometimes a gap between the industry veterans are interested in joining and the opportunities in those industries in the Gem State. 
He encourages people who are looking to move or return to Idaho to connect with other veterans here and get a sense of the environment as early in the process as they can and to be open-minded. 
“The earlier you can start those conversations, the better,” McGurkin said. 
 Military spouses face high unemployment nationwide 

Both organizations also have services for spouses of activity duty members and veterans. Those married to service members face even more unique challenges, with an unemployment rate around 22%, five times higher than the civilian population. Constant moves can make it difficult to transfer certifications or find relevant opportunities. 
Dickman said he met his spouse late in his military career while he was working at West Point Academy, so her experience with his active duty service was different from his colleagues who were on deployment cycles. However, upon his exit from service, the couple moved a few times and they learned that navigating different VA health systems was a challenge. 
McGurkin said that he and his wife moved 11 times in the 13 years total he served in ROTC and in the Marines. During that time, his wife went back to school to get a graduate degree, and eventually chose to stay home with their three young children. 
“Of all the people that we have met, we’ve seen people try to navigate it 100 different ways,” McGurkin said.

(Getty Images)For the first time since the COVID-19 vaccine was released, this year a federal health agency put new restrictions on who can get the shot. 
In past years, the annual COVID-19 vaccine was recommended for everyone aged six months and up. The federal Food and Drug Administration — under the leadership of federal health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic — this year has limited the shot to seniors 65 and older and those with an underlying condition that makes them more susceptible to severe illness from the virus.  
Further complicating matters, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Committee on Immunization Practices has not yet met to decide on its recommendations for the vaccine.
Because West Virginia law requires pharmacists to have a valid prescription for a vaccine they administer unless the shots are on the CDC’s list of recommended vaccines, West Virginians currently seeking the vaccine at local pharmacies will need a prescription, Gailyn Markham, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said in an email.
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet Sept. 18 and 19 to consider their COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. 
An official for the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy wrote on the agency’s website that with a prescription, state pharmacists may administer an age appropriate COVID shot to those age 3 and up prior to the ACIP recommendations. The board plans to update guidance for pharmacists after the ACIP meeting. 
The FDA changes this year have caused confusion for West Virginians seeking the vaccine. They’ve raised questions for local health departments about coverage of the shot and increased demand for the shot at local health departments.  
Shawn Taylor, an attorney and city councilman in Charleston, said he scheduled an appointment with a local Walgreen’s pharmacy to get both the flu and the COVID-19 vaccines. He had planned a trip and wanted to avoid getting a virus from a crowded airport or a plane. 
Taylor, 59, said he got mixed messages from his doctor’s office and the pharmacy about whether he could get the COVID-19 shot with a prescription from his doctor. His primary care office was willing to write one, but they weren’t sure if the pharmacy would have given him the shot even with the prescription. 
He ended up not bringing the prescription to his Walgreens’ appointment. When he got there, a pharmacy employee told him they would have given him the shot with a prescription.
“I ended up not getting the coronavirus vaccine,” Taylor said. “I did get my flu shot.”
Taylor plans to go back to his primary care physician to get his prescription and try again. 
“But heck, it doesn’t do me a lot of good if I end up getting the coronavirus while I’m flying from coast to coast,” he said. 
Taylor said he’s gotten the vaccine seasonally since it became available. He’s concerned about the possibility of going without it this year. As a self-employed attorney, Taylor said he can’t afford to be off of work because of sickness. 
“If I don’t work, I don’t earn any money, I don’t have a paycheck,” Taylor said. “I have to be able to be in motion. I have to be able to perform.”
Brigid Sweeney, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, wrote in an email that the pharmacy is offering the vaccine with a prescription to those over age 65 and to those under age 65 with an underlying condition.
Questions for health departments
Dr. Brian Huggins
Dr. Brian Huggins, health officer for the Monongalia County Health Department in Morgantown, said besides the FDA restrictions, the state has not issued any guidance to local health departments about this year’s changes. 
“Ultimately, we’re just making decisions on our own at the local level,” Huggins said. 
Markham, the Department of Health spokeswoman, said it’s up to local health departments whether they want to stock the vaccine for this fall. 
As of Wednesday, the health department hasn’t received the vaccines, but they’re getting a lot of questions about it, Huggins said.
“In the meantime, I have been e-prescribing the vaccine for patients that we have been seeing in our clinic for other appointments and they have been able to get the shot at local pharmacies with the e-script,” he said. 
The big question, Huggins said, is whether private health insurance companies will cover the vaccine this year, and whether the vaccine will be included in those supplied through the federal government’s Vaccines for Children program. 
While the FDA has narrowed its recommendations, some health care groups have issued their own differing recommendations. The American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending the vaccine for children ages 6 months to two years and to older children who are immunocompromised or in certain other risk groups. The CDC earlier this year removed the recommendation that pregnant people get a COVID shot, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend it. Some states — excluding West Virginia — have even issued their own standing orders for the vaccine, expanding access to the shot.
Huggins said the state health department wouldn’t typically offer guidance to health departments about COVID-19 shots, but until this year, there hadn’t been controversy and conflicting recommendations related to the vaccines.
“I think that’s part of the problem here, is that we’ve never seen where a vaccine that was previously more globally authorized by the FDA that has kind of a retraction, right? I think that’s the confusion at the health department level,” Huggins said. “Normally we would just order vaccines. We can give vaccines because, of course, most insurance companies are just automatically going to pay for people that need to get their vaccine.”
MCHD made the decision to stock enough COVID-19 vaccines to provide to people over 65 because Medicare should pay for them, he said. 
“What we don’t know for sure is what is it going to take to get the shot paid for by an insurance company?” Huggins said. “We believe it would be that if you have one of the qualifying health conditions and you’re under the age of 64 then they in, in theory, the insurance company will pay for it. The problem is, it’s a very expensive vaccine.”
According to the CDC’s vaccine price list, the adult dose of COVID vaccine costs around $140 for the private sector. 
Cathy McAlister, a spokeswoman for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield West Virginia, an insurance company that covers about 250,000 people, said the insurance company has not changed its policy for covering the COVID-19 shot. 
“We will cover COVID shots for people whose physicians say it is necessary, including those who are not in the high-risk category,” McAlister wrote in an email. “Additionally, members should be always consulting with their physician about personal health care needs.”
The insurance company itself won’t require a prescription, she added, but some clinics and pharmacies may require one. 
The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department started offering the COVID-19 shot beginning this week, according to a news release from the agency. The health department is prescribing the vaccine under a standing order from KCHD Health Officer Dr. Steven Eshenaur. The department is not requiring a separate physician’s order if patients attest to having one of the CDC’s list of risk factors for severe illness.
Dr. Steven Eshenaur
Eshenaur said the department’s vaccine management company, VaxCare, has raised questions about whether insurance plans will cover the shot before the CDC committee issues its recommendations. 
“What we have found is that we are getting a number of red lights, per se, or a stop from VaxCare as they run it through the various third-party payers, even for people that meet the guidance per the FDA,” Eshenaur said. “So, for instance, somebody 67 — everybody over 65 is recommended to receive the COVID vaccine and still getting a partner bill coding — meaning that we have to bill the individual’s insurance ourselves, because they have not gotten back authorization from that third-party payer.”
By Wednesday morning, the Kanawha health department’s COVID vaccine supply had run low. Eshenaur said people were coming to the health department after being told at a pharmacy that they need a prescription for the shot. 
“We may actually run out of COVID vaccine as early as today, because we have such unanticipated high demand compared to our numbers last year,” Eshenaur said Wednesday morning. “Because people just can’t go to the pharmacy and get it.”
In a news release Wednesday afternoon, KCHD said it had run out of the vaccine, but would order more.
“It shouldn’t be long until our COVID vaccine supply is replenished,” Eshenaur said in the news release. “We are also working through insurance issues as they arise. This situation is fluid for sure, but our priority is always to take care of the public.”

(Getty Images)Sometimes sitting in Idaho, it is hard to understand the machinations going on in Washington, D.C., especially when it is happening in an obscure congressional subcommittee. But last week the U.S. House Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee for Labor, Health, Human Services, Education and Related Agencies made headlines.
On Sept. 2, it voted to slash billions in funding for public education.
Trump campaigned on closing the Education Department. Reality is more difficult.

The budget bill, which now goes to the full House Appropriations Committee, is another punch in the gut for Idaho’s public school students. 
The bill cuts Title I funds by 27 percent. These are the all-important funds that help low-income students improve their academic outcomes. These funds provide tutoring, after-school learning opportunities and enhance parental engagement, among many other things.
In short, these funds are on the front lines of working to narrow the achievement gap between Idaho’s affluent students and the 44 percent of Idaho students who come from low-income families. 
Looking at this year’s ISAT assessment scores on reading and math puts in perspective how important these Title I funds are for Idaho’s low-income students. 
Idaho Education News reported last week that 64 percent of economically advantaged students were proficient in reading compared to 40 percent of economically disadvantaged students. On math, economically advantaged students were 52.4 percent proficient compared to 30 percent of economically disadvantaged students. 
The House subcommittee bill also eliminates all funding for other public-school programs, including funds to support teacher training and development, community schools, and English-language learning programs.
Idaho’s public schools received $65 million in Title I funds during the 2021-22 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Based on that, Idaho’s schools could lose about $20 million in Title I funds if the cuts are equitably distributed across the states.
Idaho’s 2nd District Congressman Mike Simpson is one of eleven Republicans on the subcommittee who voted for these cuts to public education, according to his office. I had to check because Simpson didn’t put out a press release announcing his vote.
Yet on Sept. 3, Simpson put out a press release proudly announcing that the Interior and Environment Subcommittee that he chairs passed a bill that provides $13 million in water projects for Idaho’s cities.
Perhaps Simpson, who supported public education when he was in the Idaho Legislature 26 years ago, has become one of those politicians who only explains his vote when it is good news, and avoids explaining his vote to constituents when it is bad news. And the budget cuts Simpson voted for on last week are certainly unwelcome news for the Idaho students in his district. 
This subcommittee action is on top of the passage of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” (BBB) which Simpson and all members of Idaho’s congressional delegation voted for in July. That bill slashed nearly $1 billion from the country’s Medicaid budget and $300 million from a supplemental nutrition program that feeds hungry students. 
Idaho’s public schools depend on Medicaid funding to ensure that students receive physical and mental health services, among other things. It is especially important funding when you consider that Idaho has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the country. 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump recently admitted that calling it a “Big Beautiful Bill” was not a good marketing move, according to Politico. “I’m not going to use the term,” Trump said. “That was good for getting it approved, but it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, a chief architect of the Big Beautiful Bill, spent the August recess in Idaho hosting invitation-only meetings to help sell the bill. Politico reported last week that Crapo is telling GOP colleagues that they need to counter attacks on the bill by making it “very clear that the so-called cuts in Medicaid were not what they are being described in the media, and in fact that they were true waste, fraud and abuse.”
Sen. Crapo lauds ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ and support of group founded by Koch brothers at private event

But don’t be fooled. An independent study by the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy earlier this year said that questionable Medicaid expenses amount to 5 percent of the program’s budget. And most of those were caused by missing or insufficient paperwork.
Most of the abuse came from Medicaid providers, not from the 83 million Americans who receive benefits, the Georgetown study said. In fact, the beneficiaries are the real victims of both unscrupulous providers and politicians who are cutting Medicaid funding. 
In short, Georgetown wrote the “narrative” that there is massive waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid “is simply false.” If the politicians are serious about eliminating abuse, Georgetown said, they only need to “follow the money” to those providers who abuse the system. A real indication that Medicaid abuse is not a significant problem is the Trump Administration’s decision to scale back departmental inspector generals who investigate waste, fraud, and abuse.
Crapo’s charge of Medicaid abuse is really a smokescreen to disguise the real reason President Trump, and the GOP Congress passed the bill – to provide a massive $4.5 billion tax cut to mainly wealthy Americans and corporations. They also don’t want the public to focus on the $4.2 billion increase to the federal deficit caused by the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” (The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget pegged the increase to the federal debt by more than $4 billion, including increased interest on the debt.)
It should also be noted that while cutting funding for public education and hungry students by $501 billion, the “Big Beautiful Bill” provides a federal voucher tax credit to provide billions of dollars to fund private and religious schools. This subsidy to private and religious school families will also be added to the federal debt. 
Gov. Brad Little and the Idaho Legislature will decide next winter whether Idaho will participate in the federal tax credit program. But Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield already told the Idaho Association of School Administrators in August that she supports adopting the federal tax credit so more money can flow to non-public school programs. 
All of this is unbelievably bad news for Idaho’s public schools which are heavily dependent on federal funding, especially since the state ranks last in the nation on how much it spends on public education. According to the Center for Education Statistics, Idaho public schools receive nearly 20 percent of their funding from the federal government.
Between the Big, Beautiful Bill and last week’s House subcommittee decision to slash Title I funding by 27 percent and zero out other programs, it’s becoming clear the Trump administration and the GOP Congress are waging a war against public schools.
This is an ideological war that hits the more than 300,000 Idaho children who attend public schools hard. And like any innocent citizens caught up in a war zone, Idaho’s students will become collateral damage and pay the price.

(Photo by Michael Chalmers)    Shepherdstown, West Virginia, is about to add a new tradition to its long history. On Saturday, Sept. 20, the town will host its first-ever Constitution Day parade — the “We the People” parade — which begins at 10 a.m. along its main thoroughfare, German Street, culminating downtown in front of Town Hall, where attendees and participants will gather in a community-wide celebration of the nation’s founding document.
The parade coincides with the 20th consecutive Constitution Day Lecture hosted by Shepherd University’s Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education. The lecture series was launched in 2005, when the late Sen. Byrd — West Virginia’s longest-serving senator — successfully championed legislation establishing Constitution Day, commemorating the signing of the Constitution in Philadelphia on Sept. 17, 1787. Byrd himself gave the inaugural lecture in the Senate’s historic caucus room in September 2005. This year’s lecture will take place at the Byrd Center on Wednesday, Sept. 17. 

West Virginia’s oldest town, Shepherdstown offers a fitting stage for such a celebration. Founded more than two decades before the Constitution was signed, the town has been entwined with the nation’s story from its earliest days. In 1775, local patriots joined the Bee Line March to support George Washington’s fledgling army in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and less than a century later, Shepherdstown stood in the shadow of Antietam, site of the bloodiest single day in American history. The parade adds a new chapter to this legacy, linking the nation’s founding ideals to a community that has long embodied them.

Earlier this summer, Shepherdstown resident and parade committee member and organizer, Mark Kohut, had been engaged in conversations and discussion groups around the topic of the Constitution for some time when he got a call from a friend who had an idea that felt both timely and appropriate.

“She said, ‘Let’s have a parade for Constitution Day,’” he said. “We have the Byrd Center right here, and the town loves parades. I said yes immediately — it just felt right.” 

Recognizing Shepherdstown’s robust connection to civic engagement, Kohut explained that feedback was quick and informative. “News goes halfway around this town before the other half wakes up,” he said. “Every person I talk to seems to want to know more. The only concern I get is ‘Is there time to pull it off?’ I think we can. The numbers continue to climb daily on Facebook.” 

 Now is the time

Local business owner and retired Gallaudet University professor, Jan Hafer, was the friend who called Kohut. For Hafer, the idea drew not only on her love for Shepherdstown and its history, but also on a lifelong commitment to civic engagement and education.
“For me, the inspiration for a parade came soon after the Bee Line March celebration earlier this summer,” she said. 

Hafer, who still carries a copy of the Constitution with her daily, called the event a powerful reminder of the region’s Revolutionary War history. 
“Those farmers marched to Boston to join the Revolution — which ultimately served as the beginning of the U.S. Army. This is important history, and it made me reflect on how much I appreciate our early roots.”
Hafer’s connection to the Constitution runs deeper than casual interest. During her time at Gallaudet, she co-taught a course on Supreme Court cases that shaped education policy, working alongside a lawyer to guide undergraduates through landmark decisions. The textbook they used was one of Congressman Jamie Raskin’s works, “We the Students: Supreme Court Cases for and About Students.”
“We took our students to the Supreme Court to watch a special education case being litigated, and Congressman Raskin even guest-lectured in our class,” she recalled. “That experience left a big impression on me and gave me a lasting appreciation for the Constitution.”
So when she and Kohut started workshopping the idea for a parade in Shepherdstown, “We thought, next year is the country’s 250th anniversary — can we create something that is in line with that and welcomes all-comers?” she said. “Mark did the work to get it approved by Town Council, started talking to people, and networking as he does. I became a sounding board.” 
In addition to the parade, Constitution Day events around Shepherdstown that week will include public readings of the Constitution, student engagement projects in local schools, trivia nights and scavenger hunts inspired by constitutional history, and special foods and treats — including a new ice cream created for the occasion.
Kohut acknowledged, “When I pitched the idea to Town Council, I spoke of Sen. Byrd, a Democrat, as well as Newt Gingirich, a Republican, who led Republicans to read the Constitution in Congress when they took it over in 1995. One of the council members in attendance notably said, ‘Now is the time.’”

Kohut also pointed out that his goal for the event is long-term. “I hope this certainly gains momentum locally — but an additional aim would be for the spirit, concept, and energy behind it to spread to other places, other towns, other cities.”

Sense of  continuity 
Ray Smock, former director of the Byrd Center and former historian of the U.S. House of Representatives, sees the parade as part of a larger civic opportunity.
“This local parade will raise awareness of the Constitution in our community,” he said. “And the idea of Constitution Day parades just might catch on. We all celebrate the Fourth of July. The Declaration of Independence was and is a big deal. But the new government that came out of the American Revolution was a big deal too. Take a look at the 52 words of the Preamble to the Constitution. It tells us what government should do and what government is for. Each generation of Americans needs to understand what the Constitution stands for.”
That sense of continuity — that the work of democracy belongs to each generation — is central to why Shepherdstown’s first Constitution parade feels so fitting to Zach Dougherty, current Byrd Center director, who echoed Smock’s sentiment.“Shepherdstown really represents the American narrative — that ordinary people, when pressed under extraordinary circumstances, are capable of meeting the challenge and making sure that the definition of what our Constitution stands for is met, expanded and extended to more Americans every generation,” he said.
Smock, who worked with Byrd during the bicentennial of the Constitution in the 1980s, added that the senator would have appreciated Shepherdstown’s efforts to expand the tradition beyond the lecture series. 
“No senator in American history has done more than West Virginia’s Sen. Byrd to promote the importance of the Constitution,” he said. “I worked with him on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. He is gone now and I can’t speak for him, but I do know that he understood that education often begins with an event, a ceremony, a speech, and it is the effort to honor the Constitution that is important, even if only one person turned out for the parade.”

Mutual obligation 
As Shepherdstown prepares for its first Constitution Day parade, Mayor James Gatz sees the event as a reflection of the town’s enduring character — and its place in the American story.
“This parade is about more than honoring a date on the calendar — it’s an opportunity to strengthen community connections,” he said. “It’s about bringing people together — family, neighbors, students, visitors — to celebrate the core principals upon which our nation is based and to remind ourselves that the Constitution belongs to all of us. 
“In a small town like Shepherdstown, where history is part of daily life, it’s a chance to honor that past while also recommitting to the values that guide our nation. I invite all residents from Shepherdstown and surrounding areas to come and celebrate with us.”
That sense of recommitment is crucial, Smock said. “Each generation of Americans has had to find ways to preserve and defend the Constitution. It is not a machine that runs by itself. The words of the Constitution are important, but it is positive actions and a respect for the rule of law that make it possible to keep our republic going strong. 
“Right now, constitutional government is in crisis largely because not enough citizens understand that the Constitution puts restraints on the people as well as those who hold high office. It calls for a separation of powers in three branches of government. At present, all the power seems to be in one branch, and this is not healthy.”
Smock has seen the Constitution tested before. During his time as House historian, he occasionally lunched with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who chaired the national commission commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. He recalled Burger sharing his perspective on one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions in American history — the ruling that forced President Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes.
“I asked the Chief Justice what he thought was the significance of that decision,” Smock said. “He said that no one knew for sure how President Nixon would react. What if he refused to turn over the tapes? In the meantime, Republican members of the House and Senate visited Nixon to inform him that Congress would probably impeach him and remove him from office. Faced with impeachment, and faced with the decision of the Supreme Court, Nixon decided to resign. Congress and the Supreme Court put constitutional pressure on the president. Chief Justice Burger said, ‘The Constitution worked.’ And that made all the difference. Checks and balances are essential, and no person is above the law.”
For Dougherty, that lesson continues to resonate. “When you look at the Constitution, the remarkable thing in our current context is that you won’t find the word Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Whether you’re a kid in New Jersey or an older citizen from West Virginia, you are viewed as equal under the law. In the current climate we’re living in, it’s important for all Americans to remember that we have a mutual obligation to each other — a mutual responsibility to the ideals of the Constitution. It has never been, nor will it ever be, just a document. It’s something we have to live and uphold every day.”

Hundreds of people have turned out at community meetings, rallies and local government meetings to voice their opposition to the proposed expansion of one of the largest factory farms in the region. 
In May, 100 people showed up to get organized in support of a legal challenge against Ridge Breeze Dairy’s permit to spread 80 million gallons of manure across western Wisconsin. Another 100 people showed up in the town of Maiden Rock to support the passage of an operations ordinance aimed at protecting local health and property values. Over 400 people registered for a DNR public hearing last year to show their opposition to the expansion.
These actions represent a growing unity and commitment to safeguarding clean water, clean air and the small farms that are threatened by Breeze’s expansion. That kind of unity drives action. It inspired the Maiden Rock town board’s unanimous vote to pass its operations ordinance in December 2024. And it’s inspired many more towns that have started studying and drafting ordinances of their own. 
For the last two years, Grassroots Organizing Western Wisconsin (GROWW) has played a key role in bringing together ordinary people and small farmers to pass local ordinances to protect our homes. People across the region are holding strong as corporate mega-dairies try to take over our agricultural landscape. 
But powerful special interests are trying to prevent local leaders from taking action to protect our communities. Venture Dairy, a lobbying group representing industrial dairy interests, strongly supports Ridge Breeze Dairy’s $35 million plan to expand from 1,700 to 6,500 cows and has attempted to intimidate towns and counties looking to protect their land, water and roads from the impacts of industrial agriculture. 
In 2020, for instance, leaders at Venture Dairy falsely told Polk County supervisors that they would be committing a felony if they voted for a moratorium on factory farm expansions. The Wisconsin Counties Association’s general counsel wrote a letter publicly refuting this ridiculous claim. More recently, officials in towns like Pepin, Gilman and Rock Elm have been subjected to similar intimidation tactics and disinformation regarding the regulation of industrial dairy farms.
The truth is that, thanks to the efforts of industry lobbyists whittling down and undermining state rules and enforcement, oversight of large-scale livestock operations in Wisconsin has been stretched thin. With more than 330 factory farms across Wisconsin, our communities have largely been left to fill the gap. 
But that’s still too much for Venture Dairy. They were recently behind a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin’s authority to protect water quality. If they had gotten their way, there would be no DNR regulations for hundreds of factory farms across the state. Last month, that lawsuit was rejected unanimously by an appeals court.
Venture Dairy’s founding members include Todd Tuls, former owner of the Emerald Sky Dairy in St Croix County. In Emerald, the town well – only half-a-mile away from the facility – has nitrate levels that have reached as high as six times the Safe Drinking Water standards. Emerald Sky had a 300,000-gallon manure spill in 2016 that went unreported for months before a neighbor notified the state. Emerald Sky has since been sold to Breeze Dairy Group, owners of Ridge Breeze Dairy in Pierce County.

Despite these challenges, people in western Wisconsin are making real progress. In the face of industry opposition, we are successfully organizing to fight the corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry. Our community organizing resulted in the DNR recently removing 2,000 acres from Ridge Breeze’s manure spreading plan due to risks to groundwater and surface water that we identified. If not for our comments provided in the public hearing process, those acres very likely would have been rubber stamped. Last year, we identified hundreds of acres of land that had been listed on Ridge Breeze’s plan for manure spreading without permission from landowners. Due to our organizing and public pressure at a public hearing, we were able to get that land removed and require Ridge Breeze to submit affidavits attesting to the fact that they have permission to spread on the land listed on their plan. Unfortunately, these affidavits have not worked, and people have continued to come forward to remove their land. 
Recognizing the holes in state regulations, we organized to pass local ordinances like the operations ordinance in the town of Maiden Rock, which was passed last year and protects the town residents from the risks of factory farms. That organizing is now reverberating through the region, with people in western Wisconsin and beyond going to town board meetings with their neighbors to create the change they need to protect their homes. Just this week, 75 neighbors gathered in the town of Isabelle for a public hearing on an operations ordinance drafted by their town board. Those neighbors were united in their support for clean water, clean air and local control.
Regular people have decided the future of rural Wisconsin is worth fighting for, but the only way to change the path we’re on is to get organized. It’s time to join together with your neighbors who share your vision for your community and make a plan to bring change. The future of our rural communities depends on it.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-10-at-5.03.43 PM-1024x656.png,,,2025-09-11 06:56:30.168437

(Google Maps)​​A federal appeals court heard oral arguments Wednesday in a case challenging the ability of Colorado legislators to require respectful speech during legislative hearings. 
The initial lawsuit, filed last year in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, claimed the state legislators named as defendants violated the plaintiffs’ right to free speech by stopping them from misgendering and deadnaming transgender people during their testimony in a legislative committee hearing. 
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Rich Guggenheim and Christina Goeke, seek damages and for the court to block enforcement of decorum rules around respectful language in committee hearings at the Colorado General Assembly.

In March 2024, they both testified against House Bill 24-1071, which added gender-affirming care to the definition of good cause for when a person convicted of a felony petitions to change their legal name. During their testimony, Guggenheim and Goeke repeatedly misgendered and deadnamed Tiara Latrice Kelley, a transgender woman for whom the law was named.
The plaintiffs opposed the bill because they believe “it will make it easier for transgender individuals to conceal criminal convictions and thus pose a danger to children, women, and vulnerable populations,” the initial complaint says.
Judge Regina Rodriguez dismissed the case in November 2024, concluding that the legislators’ actions were “within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity” and that the plaintiff’s claims are moot because the bills they testified on already passed and became law, and the decorum rules and restrictions they challenged were set specifically for testimony on that law. 
“Plaintiffs have not pointed to any ‘continuing, present adverse effects’ beyond speculation that there will potentially be future bills that implicate transgender concerns, that Plaintiffs will likely want to testify on these potential bills, and that the same decorum rules and restrictions may be put in place for any public testimony hearings on these potential bills,” Rodriguez wrote in her order.
The plaintiffs, who are represented by attorneys from the conservative Institute for Free Speech, appealed Rodriguez’s order to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a panel of three judges heard the case Wednesday. 
Endel Kolde, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the state legislators discriminated against and censored the plaintiffs based on their viewpoints. He argued deadnaming and misgendering should be permitted if they are done in relation to substantive argument about legislation, to which Judge Joel Carson responded, “Isn’t that really hard for courts to police?”
Kolde also argued that legislative immunity does not apply to this case, and saying it does would allow legislative bodies to censor anyone they disagree with.
Edward Ramey, attorney for the defendants, said legislative immunity is the “primary defense” in the case, as the limitations the state legislators set were for “legitimate legislative activity.” He said it is up to the legislators overseeing legislative hearings what rules they want to set for their committee hearings.
Rules for public testimony in both the Colorado House and Senate note that a committee chair has the discretion to limit testimony and ask for disruptive people to be removed. Legislative hearings are limited public forums, which means the discussion can be confined to a certain topic and must follow the rules set ahead of time.
Legislators named in the lawsuit include state Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat who previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adam County Democrat; former Rep. Leslie Herod, a Denver Democrat; state Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee; and Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, a Commerce City Democrat.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A legal challenge to a new state law that criminalizes the act of concealing or sheltering individuals illegally in the country had its first day in court Wednesday as a federal judge weighed a motion to temporarily block portions of the legislation as the case goes forward.
The Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America filed suit against the Tennessee law just days before it took effect July 1.
The denomination argued the law, passed as part of a Republican effort to align state policy with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, puts pastors and church members at risk for criminal charges in carrying out their faith-driven mission to offer shelter and sanctuary to individuals regardless of immigration status. 
Lawyers for the Synod argued that the law is an infringement on religious freedom, vaguely written and illegally sets immigration policy, a responsibility that falls to Congress. 
A Nashville landlord, concerned about criminal charges for renting to an immigrant without legal status, and an unidentified immigrant from Mexico are also plaintiffs in the suit. 
An attorney defending the measure argued that pastors had a “needless fear of the law.”
Suit seeks to block Tennessee law that makes it a crime to “harbor” certain immigrants

The law makes it a crime to harbor immigrants “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain” and is intended to apply to “professional smuggling operations,” not churches that accept donations to provide services to those in need, argued Miranda Jones, senior assistant attorney general. 
U.S. District Judge William Campbell, Jr. urged lawyers on both sides to agree on a compromise that would spell out that the law, at least temporarily, would not be enforced against members of the Lutheran Synod.
That effort failed once Jones told Campbell her superiors in the Tennessee Office of Attorney General would not agree; the state’s position is the law won’t target houses of worship, making a written agreement between the two parties unnecessary, she said.
“It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me,” Campbell responded. “It’s difficult to understand the harm.” 
Campbell instead required the attorneys to report to the court if any individuals represented in the suit faced arrest or prosecution under the new law. 
Thus far, no one has been charged with a crime under the new law, Jones said.
Campbell deferred a decision on the request to temporarily halt the portion of state law that makes it a felony offense to harbor immigrants in the country illegally, saying he would “take it under advisement.”
Separately on Wednesday, 21 Republican attorneys general filed a brief in the case supporting Tennessee’s law. 
“Many States have enacted state crimes that complement federal immigration laws like the law enacted by Tennessee that Plaintiffs seek to enjoin,” they wrote. “Those complements are no conflict or obstacle to federal immigration law. Instead, they help States support federal immigration enforcement goals.”

Henry, The Marshall Project and Mina Corpuz",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/11/mississippi-prison-killings-death/,At least 42 incarcerated people have been killed in the last decade in Mississippi prisons. Just six people have been convicted in their deaths.,"At least 42 people have been killed inside Mississippi prisons in the past decade, leaving scores of grieving families questioning a system that fails to protect people in its custody or hold anyone accountable.
There are sisters wracked with guilt, mothers with depression, and children struggling to fill the voids in their lives. Former prison employees talk about lying sleepless in bed, replaying the killings they’ve witnessed but could not stop.
In Mississippi, prison homicides are the culmination of long-documented festering problems: chronic understaffing, lax oversight, gangs that rule by violence and delays in treating life-threatening injuries, an investigation by a statewide reporting team found.
Murders signal “catastrophic failures” of prison administrators, whose number one job is to keep incarcerated people safe, said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project.
The perpetrators haven’t faced justice in most cases. Just six of the 42 homicides have led to convictions. 
And the killings show no sign of ending. In the first half of this year, there were five homicides in three Mississippi prisons.
Sydney Miller said her family was given almost no details by prison officials after her elder brother, Gregory Emary, was stabbed to death at the Chickasaw County Regional Facility in Houston in 2020. 
Over the past five years, they have received no contact from prison investigators or prosecutors about what happened or if someone would be held responsible. Miller did not know Emary’s death had been deemed a homicide by a medical examiner until a reporter told her. She wonders if her family would have been treated the same way if her brother had been killed on the outside. 
“So why is this any different?” Miller asked. “Just because it was committed inside prison walls?”
‘No one deserves to die like this’
Uncovering the toll of Mississippi’s prison homicides took a team of reporters from five news organizations: The Marshall Project – Jackson, Mississippi Today, the Clarion Ledger, Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link. The team scoured thousands of pages of court records, corrections documents, federal and state government death records, and interviewed families, formerly incarcerated people, former guards, attorneys and corrections experts. 
The investigation found that the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, which holds about 2,500 people, has had the most killings in the past decade. At least 19 people died in homicides at Parchman from 2015 through 2024.
For most of this time period, the homicide rate among people inside Parchman was five times higher than the state as a whole, which already had the highest rate in the country in 2023.
Lack of consistent and accurate reporting nationwide makes a state-by-state comparison of prison homicides difficult. The reporting team identified three Mississippi homicides that were not listed in federal and state reports.
Most of the 42 killings throughout the state prison system involved beatings or stabbings, sometimes involving multiple assailants. Three in five victims were Black. The age of the victims ranged from 23 to 62.

Mississippi Department of Corrections officials declined multiple requests for an interview about killings across the prison system, but released an emailed statement. “MDOC remains committed to ensuring the safety of inmates in its custody,” the agency wrote.
Many of the people who were killed in Mississippi’s prisons were sent there after being convicted of offenses that included parole and probation violations, as well as more serious crimes, including robbery and murder. At least a quarter were serving life sentences. Although prison officials have a legal duty to protect all incarcerated people from harm, they could not protect them from death at the hands of cellmates, rival gang members or other incarcerated people.
In one case, a corrections officer pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact in a 2021 murder.
Detrick Munford, who served as deputy warden of Parchman until 2022, said the number of unprosecuted homicides doesn’t surprise him.
Mississippi officials didn’t install many of the cameras at Parchman until after 2020, so in many cases, there was no way to prove who was responsible for a death, he said. Anyone who witnessed a killing “is not going to talk,” he said, alluding to the prison culture of violent retribution, “because he knows what might happen to him.”
MDOC often shares sparse details about prison homicides, if any at all, even with the families of the victims. Nearly all internal investigations into the killings are hidden from the public because the state’s open records law exempts all law enforcement investigative files.
Although many of the recent homicides were filmed by security cameras and some of those responsible are known to corrections officials based on internal reports, local prosecutors filed charges against suspects in 36% of the homicides in the past decade.
MDOC officials responded in their email that prison officials take “every death of an inmate in its custody seriously. Each suspected homicide is investigated…The remaining investigations that are closed did not support a referral (for prosecution).”
In one criminal case, a charge was filed, but the Marshall County District Attorney’s office essentially forgot to prosecute the suspect nearly four years after the prison killing. The indictment had gotten lost in the bureaucracy, District Attorney Ben Creekmore later acknowledged in an interview. It was reactivated only after a reporter from the news team called him about the case.
The prospect of criminal prosecution, however, is likely of little concern to someone already serving a multi-decade sentence. The continued killings show how the prison system has not significantly addressed its failures to prevent homicides. The reporting team identified one person who pleaded guilty to manslaughter for a killing in one prison, then allegedly went on to kill again in another prison. He is awaiting trial on the second homicide charge and is currently serving a 40-year sentence.
DeAndre Davis was serving a life sentence when he was stabbed to death in 2017 in the Wilkinson County Correctional Facility in Woodville, months after he was stabbed in another attack at the same prison. At the sentencing hearing for the man convicted of the killing, Davis’ mother, Victorra Williams, said she didn’t understand why her son died, because he was supposed to be in isolation after he received a death threat. 
“No one deserves to die like this,” she told the judge.
“I understand that they are in prison, and I understand that they are (caged), but I don’t understand you are in prison and you are steady killing each other for no reason,” Williams said. “That’s just — that’s crazy.” 
Punishment after killing: loss of privileges
Growing up, Marcie Harper protected her baby brother, Joshua Odom. He was smaller than the other kids, so she fought his fights. She called him her Cabbage Patch Kid because of his big blue eyes and bald head. Her brother grew into a wiry man who loved to fish, gaining him the nickname Catfish.
“I was always there for him,” Harper said.
But Odom developed a drug problem that landed him in and out of prison, locked away from his big sister, who couldn’t always afford to visit or talk to him on the phone. 
She could not be there to protect her brother on Jan. 12, 2025. 
He died, a casualty of prison violence, lax security and questionable medical care that gave superficial treatment to a head wound that would prove fatal. 
Odom was incarcerated at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Leakesville. His friend Shelby Peevyhouse, who has a pacemaker, had just gotten into a fight and been kicked in the chest. As Odom came over to check on his friend, Peevyhouse said later, another incarcerated person punched Odom, knocking him to the ground, where he hit his head and fell unconscious.
When Odom came to, guards were restraining him, Peevyhouse said from prison.
“Don’t kill him. He needs your help,” Peevyhouse pleaded with the guards as they wrestled Odom. Both men were taken to the medical wing.
“Catfish was laying there screaming for help in a medical gurney to the left of me, calling for his mama,” Peevyhouse said. 
Guards declined to call an ambulance and went home, as their shifts were ending, Peevyhouse said. Instead, he said, a medical staffer glued Odom’s head wound shut and sent both injured men back to their housing unit. 
Odom, though, was dazed. He couldn’t even say his name. Peevyhouse tried to keep his friend awake. 
“I did not know what to do,” Peevyhouse said. “I was so scared.”
As Odom began vomiting a “pink foam,” Peevyhouse banged on a window. He says he told a guard coming around for a count to call medical or else he would start a fire. 
A medical worker took Odom away in a wheelchair. “Hey, smile a little,” Odom said before being wheeled off. Peevyhouse lit a cigarette for his friend, told him he loved him, and that he would be there when Odom got back. This time, an ambulance was called. It was too late. 
The next morning, Peevyhouse found out Odom was dead. 
“He was my best friend. This is really hard for me,” Peevyhouse said repeatedly.
The state medical examiner ruled Odom’s death a homicide by blunt force trauma. Because his alleged attacker was never criminally charged, the reporting team is not naming him. Imprisoned on a domestic violence conviction, he is scheduled for release by 2028.
The suspect was issued a disciplinary citation for assaulting another person. Prisons use a rules violation book that outlines dozens of actions that are prohibited inside prison walls, from hoarding food to attacking others. According to a rule violation report obtained by the reporting team, guards used security camera footage to confirm the assault.
The suspect’s punishment was the loss of 180 days of earned time — time that would have reduced his sentence for good conduct — as well as lost phone and visitation privileges for 60 days, and he was held responsible for Odom’s medical costs, which were not listed. He did not receive a higher violation for causing Odom’s death. The next day, he was transferred to another facility, which is MDOC’s standard procedure.

State Rep. Becky Currie, a registered nurse, has publicly criticized VitalCore, the company contracted to provide medical care in the state’s prisons, after meeting and receiving letters from incarcerated people who claim they were not getting care for treatable illnesses and injuries. 
“It is hard for me to hear that (MDOC) feels that they provide adequate care,” Currie told Mississippi Today. 
A spokesperson for VitalCore told Mississippi Today that the company provides “comprehensive and competent health care services in accordance with prevailing standards of care.”
After Odom’s death, his sister said the family could not get a clear story from prison officials.
The official who called their mother said Odom had been found hurt and died at the hospital. It wasn’t until someone connected to Peevyhouse sent her a Facebook message that she found out that her brother died waiting for an ambulance.
The 40-year-old Odom, incarcerated since 2018 after being convicted of burglary and credit card fraud, was supposed to be released in a few weeks, his family said.
“I just wish I had something of his,” Harper said. Instead, all she has left are memories and his ashes, which the family plans to scatter in the Gulf, where he loved to fish, on his birthday. 
Soon, she’ll also have a tattoo of a catfish on a hook with a phrase he always told her: “Keep your head up.”
Constitutional violations, few answers
Odom’s death came less than a year after the federal Department of Justice found that three Mississippi prisons — including the South Mississippi prison where he had been held — violated the constitutional rights of the more than 7,400 people housed in them by failing to protect them from widespread violence. The investigation listed numerous failures: gross understaffing, assaults that are likely undercounted because of this lack of staff supervision, gang brawls involving dozens of people, violent incidents that go uninvestigated, and bungled investigations that lead nowhere.
The Justice Department had found similar violations in a 2022 investigation of the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. 
What Odom’s family experienced is common. The reporting team found that the families of other incarcerated people killed in prison were often left without answers. Many of those interviewed learned details about their loved ones’ deaths through a whisper network of incarcerated people, insiders, advocates, and, in some cases, from journalists. 
Some families contacted lawyers, attempting to file civil suits, only to find out that no one would take their cases.
“I literally just gave up on it,” said Dale Graham, whose brother was killed in the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in 2021. “Nothing happened.”
Currie, a Brookhaven Republican, who chairs the state’s House Corrections Committee, has raised questions about how the prisons are run, including the health and safety of the incarcerated.
She said prison killings show that violence is rampant inside the state’s prisons, and that it’s amplified by issues such as contraband and gangs. 
“Whatever the cause of death is, I think the families are owed an answer,” she said. “Was my loved one killed? Was it that their diabetes wasn’t tended to? What was the cause of death?” Currie asked. “And I do not know of one family that’s ever received that answer.”
She has wondered how seemingly healthy men die in Mississippi’s prisons. Currie said she plans to introduce legislation to create a group of lawmakers and prison officials to look into all prison deaths, which can serve as a guide on how to prevent future deaths. 
In a written response to reporters’ questions, MDOC said the department has taken several corrective measures since the Justice Department began investigating the prison system in 2020, including improved training, facility upgrades and increased staffing.
MDOC said the Justice Department’s investigation is ongoing, and both sides are engaged in confidential settlement negotiations. 
A deadly prison economy
Violent deaths in Mississippi prisons tend to lead back to the same factors: understaffing, poor training, and gang control, according to lawyers, experts, former corrections staffers interviewed, and the Justice Department reports. 
Prison guards, many of whom are young and female, are poorly trained and sometimes left alone to oversee units holding as many as 180 men, according to Catina Washington, a former MDOC case manager who said she was assaulted in December 2020 by an incarcerated person at the South Mississippi prison. Her attacker was charged with simple assault, but the charge was later dropped due to conflicting witness testimony.
Guards make decisions on whether a sick or injured person can see a prison nurse or even go to a hospital. 
“We don’t realize how much trust of another person’s life we put into the hands of correctional officers,” said Greta Kemp Martin, formerly the litigation director of Disability Rights Mississippi. “They literally hold your life in their hands.”
Poor oversight allows gang members to take advantage of the security gaps, buying and selling illegal drugs and cellphones, sometimes with the help of prison guards whom they recruit to smuggle contraband in. The reporting team identified several criminal cases in which corrections officers were charged with bringing in drugs or cellphones. Martin said some incarcerated clients have told her about correctional officers who share gang affiliations with them. 
The gangs run a brutal underground economy. A debt to the wrong person can cost a life, as it did for 31-year-old Jeremy Irons, who was killed over $40 in Parchman, federal and state reports showed. 
The Justice Department’s investigations found that the facilities operated at dangerously low staffing levels. In 2022, the Central Mississippi prison was operating with 44% of the employees needed to run the facility. At the South Mississippi prison, where Odom was later killed, the facility ran with 36% of the necessary employees. And in Wilkinson County’s prison, a human resources manager told investigators that the officer vacancy rate hovered around 50%.
Chronic understaffing is a key factor in prison homicides across the nation, said Fathi, of the ACLU National Prison Project. And what staff there is may be poorly trained to handle violence.
Former MDOC staffers reported that their training was rushed, leaving them unprepared for the dangers of the job. 
“Parchman is all about ‘We’re gonna hurry up and get you out of class, throw your ass out there, because we need people to watch the inmates,” a former correctional officer, who did not want his name used for fear of retaliation, told a reporter. “Many times I’ve seen people get killed right in front of me, and it really wasn’t nothing you could really do, because you ain’t but one person.”
Chuck Mullins, a lawyer who has represented Mississippi families in wrongful prison death cases for decades, said in many of the death cases he has litigated, he found that staff were either not present or poorly trained.
Chronic understaffing and poor training endanger both the incarcerated people and corrections staff, leaving many who remain fearful to do their jobs. The Justice Department’s reports cited multiple instances of staff failing or refusing to do security counts and falsifying count sheets. 
Disciplinary reports reviewed by the reporting team show corrections officers being overpowered, beaten, choked, stabbed, spit on and sprayed with human waste. 
Fatal beating overlooked for five hours
Army veteran Ronnie Graham survived combat in Iraq. He survived cancer.
He did not survive nine days inside the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Pearl. 
In the early hours before dawn in December 2021, prison security camera footage captured a man attacking Graham near his bunk, choking and kicking him in the head, according to federal and state records reviewed by the reporting team. 
Throughout the night, Graham passed in and out of consciousness. Later, another person punched him in the face. More than five hours later, an officer found Graham and called for help. By then, his body was rigid, and he was foaming at the mouth. Graham died soon after help arrived. 
For at least five hours, Graham suffered. And for most of that time, guards were nowhere to be found. An investigative report noted that an officer turned the lights off in the unit about 45 minutes after Graham was attacked, but no officer walked through to check on the welfare of the men held there. 
“If someone would have done their job that night, he would still be alive today,” his brother, Dale Graham, said. “But because someone didn’t do their job, my brother is now dead.”
No one was charged in Graham’s death.
Lawsuits and internal prison reports show that, on multiple occasions, guards did not find a dead person for hours.
Earlier this year, Jonathan Havard was strangled in the Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. A parent, who found out about the death through unknown means, notified the prison that someone in Havard’s cell was dead, according to an internal MDOC report. 
Last year, a group of roughly 10 people beat and stabbed 28-year-old Edward Boyd to death at East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Lauderdale County, according to a lawsuit his family filed against the private prison company that operates the lockup, Management & Training Corp. The suit stated that the attackers killed him “in plain view of surveillance camera” and then “dragged (Boyd) into a cell, where they left him to die.” 
He was found covered in blood during a morning count. The lawsuit alleges that a correctional officer wrote in a report that they had last seen Boyd alive and well during a 4 a.m. count. However, there was no evidence of a count being conducted at 4 a.m., according to the lawsuit.
In response to the lawsuit, MTC denied any negligence or wrongdoing. The case is pending in federal court.
Dead-end investigations
When someone is killed in a Mississippi prison, typically, the department conducts an investigation. It interviews staff, witnesses, sometimes confidential informants, people it believes to be complicit in the death, and reviews camera footage.  
MDOC sometimes requests help from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. 
However, the U.S. Justice Department found many investigations by the department were incomplete, failed to answer key questions or were mishandled. 
Investigations of homicides that stemmed from fights over drug debts routinely ignored the source of the drugs or failed to conduct follow-up interviews.
During the 2022 Parchman investigation, a supervisor in MDOC’s investigative division told Justice Department officials that the caseload was too heavy and staffers were too overworked to conduct comprehensive investigations.
For example, after Jeremy Irons was stabbed to death in 2019, the internal investigation concluded that one incarcerated person stabbed him and flushed the weapon down the toilet. 
The investigation into Irons’ death relied on one written statement from a trainee officer. No other staff was interviewed. However, several other people took part in the fight, which stemmed from Irons’ $40 debt to another person, according to the Justice Department. 
After MDOC concludes its investigations, it may pass its findings along to local county district attorneys, who can then seek an indictment from a grand jury. 
In an August 2019 case, Samuel Wade was strangled to death at Parchman. The Justice Department’s investigation references an incarcerated person strangled with a bedsheet that month. The victim’s cellmate allegedly confessed to the killing, and MDOC referred the case to the Sunflower County district attorney, according to the investigation. After six years, however, no charges have been filed.
Sunflower County District Attorney Dewayne Richardson has not responded to multiple interview requests.
Criminal charges have only been filed in five of the 19 killings in Parchman over the past decade. Four of those cases are pending in the courts. The fifth was dismissed after the defendant died by suicide.
Other district attorneys with prisons in their counties did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on open cases. 
Experts said secrecy around prison operations and the lack of oversight, coupled with the general public’s lack of concern toward incarcerated people, allow the long-documented abuses and civil rights violations to continue. 
Reforms to reduce deaths in custody have been hampered by “the secrecy that pervades prisons and jails,” said Andrea Armstrong, a Loyola University New Orleans law professor and leading researcher on deaths behind bars.
Many of the prison incident records the reporting team obtained came with scant narratives or with entire sections blacked out, even though such records are public under the state’s open records law.
In the past decade, at least five families of people killed in Mississippi prisons have filed civil lawsuits against the Department of Corrections or Management & Training Corp. However, documents in these lawsuits, such as evidence and settlement details, are often sealed or protected by confidentiality agreements.
For the incarcerated people who have been killed, their families are left with little, other than despair. 
“This (is) an unimaginable pain you all gave me. This grief will last forever,” one victim’s mother wrote in a court statement for the upcoming trial of the prison murder of her son. 
“People talk about justice. They say it’s blind. But justice shouldn’t be silent. It shouldn’t turn away when someone dies in state custody,” she wrote. “If the state takes responsibility for a person’s life, it should also be held accountable when that life is lost.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)This Monday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey hosted a press conference at the state capitol with West Virginia lawmakers and a few guests. The purpose of the press conference was to celebrate the donation of 2,500 “In God We Trust” posters to be put up at schools and in classrooms around the state. 
The donation became possible after the legislature was finally successful last session in passing a bill to require these displays in schools. It doesn’t allow public funds to be spent on them, which screams to me that someone already had an idea about who could possibly fund the initiative, especially if schools needed to have them up before the start of the new school year as the bill suggests.  
It turns out the backers are affiliated with a national push to blur the constitutional separation between church and state. One of the speakers was Andrea Justus, who works at First Liberty Institute. That organization takes religious freedom cases around the country. They also were on the advisory board for the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. 
One might remember Project 2025 as being the masterplan that President Donald Trump claimed he never heard of during his 2024 presidential campaign and was not affiliated with. Despite that claim, his administration has still followed its playbook to dismantle environmental protection programs, health care and other civic institutions this year. 
The actual funder for the posters that are required to be posted in every school in West Virginia is Patriot Mobile, a conservative cell phone service. Patriot Mobile also has a conservative political action committee named Patriot Mobile Action. Among other goals, they have worked to get religious people elected to take over school boards. In 2022 NBC News wrote an investigation titled “How a far-right, Christian cellphone company ‘took over’ four Texas school boards” filled with some illuminating points that concern me about West Virginia’s open embrace of Patriot Mobile. 
The NBC story mentioned that Patriot Mobile was strategizing back in 2022 about how to replicate their takeover of school boards and do it in more Texas counties. Are they planning to expand their influence into local and state West Virginia elections? 
Schools are already facing teacher shortages and budget shortfalls, in some parts due to a declining state population and also to the Hope Scholarship funneling money to private schools that have little accountability and are allowed to discriminate against students. I am skeptical that pushing public schools to incorporate more religious signage and teachings by getting into bed with far-right national organizations will encourage families to remain in West Virginia and reverse that population trend. 
It’s not going to stop with the In God We Trust posters. With a literal wink, Justus with First Liberty Institute offered her organization’s help to West Virginia lawmakers to get a bill passed to require the Ten Commandments be posted at schools as well. Louisiana and Texas recently passed bills to require that and it’s already been tied up in federal courts. 
The press conference itself was a mockery of what should happen at the Capitol. The banner backdrop to talking about religion in schools was filled with organization logos. Justus gave a free plug for Patriot Mobile by saying it’s her phone provider. It’s difficult to take a press conference seriously when it serves as free publicity and advertising for a telephone company. 
As West Virginia Watch pointed out, Senate President Randy Smith said that the United States “started going downhill when we took God out of our schools” and he thinks there are statistics to back that up. I would hope that he would offer them up. I also hope that our Senate president understands the difference between correlation and causation. 
Morrisey mentioned recognizing “our God” in schools. What about other religions?
It’s clear that when these people are talking about putting God “back in schools” they mean the God for one certain religion. A Christian Texas Democrat went viral when he spoke about how putting the Ten Commandments in school is an anti-Christian and a violation of the commandments themselves. His argument even seemed to persuade podcaster Joe Rogan. 
This press conference and the inevitable push to put the Ten Commandments in schools are just the latest moves in the West Virginia Legislature’s desire to make the state a less welcoming place for people who are different. I encourage West Virginians to keep an eye out for which rich, outside actors we are letting influence our lawmakers in the 2026 legislative session and beyond.

(Getty Images)When OpenAI released “study mode” in July 2025, the company touted ChatGPT’s educational benefits. “When ChatGPT is prompted to teach or tutor, it can significantly improve academic performance,” the company’s vice president of education told reporters at the product’s launch. But any dedicated teacher would be right to wonder: Is this just marketing, or does scholarly research really support such claims?
While generative AI tools are moving into classrooms at lightning speed, robust research on the question at hand hasn’t moved nearly as fast. Some early studies have shown benefits for certain groups such as computer programming students and English language learners. And there have been a number of other optimistic studies on AI in education, such as one published in the journal Nature in May 2025 suggesting that chatbots may aid learning and higher-order thinking. But scholars in the field have pointed to significant methodological weaknesses in many of these research papers.
Other studies have painted a grimmer picture, suggesting that AI may impair performance or cognitive abilities such as critical thinking skills. One paper showed that the more a student used ChatGPT while learning, the worse they did later on similar tasks when ChatGPT wasn’t available.
In other words, early research is only beginning to scratch the surface of how this technology will truly affect learning and cognition in the long run. Where else can we look for clues? As a cognitive psychologist who has studied how college students are using AI, I have found that my field offers valuable guidance for identifying when AI can be a brain booster and when it risks becoming a brain drain.
 Skill comes from effort

Cognitive psychologists have argued that our thoughts and decisions are the result of two processing modes, commonly denoted as System 1 and System 2.
The former is a system of pattern matching, intuition and habit. It is fast and automatic, requiring little conscious attention or cognitive effort. Many of our routine daily activities – getting dressed, making coffee and riding a bike to work or school – fall into this category. System 2, on the other hand, is generally slow and deliberate, requiring more conscious attention and sometimes painful cognitive effort, but often yields more robust outputs.
We need both of these systems, but gaining knowledge and mastering new skills depend heavily on System 2. Struggle, friction and mental effort are crucial to the cognitive work of learning, remembering and strengthening connections in the brain. Every time a confident cyclist gets on a bike, they rely on the hard-won pattern recognition in their System 1 that they previously built up through many hours of effortful System 2 work spent learning to ride. You don’t get mastery and you can’t chunk information efficiently for higher-level processing without first putting in the cognitive effort and strain.
I tell my students the brain is a lot like a muscle: It takes genuine hard work to see gains. Without challenging that muscle, it won’t grow bigger.
 What if a machine does the work for you?

Now imagine a robot that accompanies you to the gym and lifts the weights for you, no strain needed on your part. Before long, your own muscles will have atrophied and you’ll become reliant on the robot at home even for simple tasks like moving a heavy box.
AI, used poorly – to complete a quiz or write an essay, say – lets students bypass the very thing they need to develop knowledge and skills. It takes away the mental workout.
Using technology to effectively offload cognitive workouts can have a detrimental effect on learning and memory and can cause people to misread their own understanding or abilities, leading to what psychologists call metacognitive errors. Research has shown that habitually offloading car navigation to GPS may impair spatial memory and that using an external source like Google to answer questions makes people overconfident in their own personal knowledge and memory.
Are there similar risks when students hand off cognitive tasks to AI? One study found that students researching a topic using ChatGPT instead of a traditional web search had lower cognitive load during the task – they didn’t have to think as hard – and produced worse reasoning about the topic they had researched. Surface-level use of AI may mean less cognitive burden in the moment, but this is akin to letting a robot do your gym workout for you. It ultimately leads to poorer thinking skills.
In another study, students using AI to revise their essays scored higher than those revising without AI, often by simply copying and pasting sentences from ChatGPT. But these students showed no more actual knowledge gain or knowledge transfer than their peers who worked without it. The AI group also engaged in fewer rigorous System 2 thinking processes. The authors warn that such “metacognitive laziness” may prompt short-term performance improvements but also lead to the stagnation of long-term skills.
Offloading can be useful once foundations are in place. But those foundations can’t be formed unless your brain does the initial work necessary to encode, connect and understand the issues you’re trying to master.
 Using AI to support learning

Returning to the gym metaphor, it may be useful for students to think of AI as a personal trainer who can keep them on task by tracking and scaffolding learning and pushing them to work harder. AI has great potential as a scalable learning tool, an individualized tutor with a vast knowledge base that never sleeps.
AI technology companies are seeking to design just that: the ultimate tutor. In addition to OpenAI’s entry into education, in April 2025 Anthropic released its learning mode for Claude. These models are supposed to engage in Socratic dialogue, to pose questions and provide hints, rather than just giving the answers.
Early research indicates AI tutors can be beneficial but introduce problems as well. For example, one study found high school students reviewing math with ChatGPT performed worse than students who didn’t use AI. Some students used the base version and others a customized tutor version that gave hints without revealing answers. When students took an exam later without AI access, those who’d used base ChatGPT did much worse than a group who’d studied without AI, yet they didn’t realize their performance was worse. Those who’d studied with the tutor bot did no better than students who’d reviewed without AI, but they mistakenly thought they had done better. So AI didn’t help, and it introduced metacognitive errors.
Even as tutor modes are refined and improved, students have to actively select that mode and, for now, also have to play along, deftly providing context and guiding the chatbot away from worthless, low-level questions or sycophancy.
The latter issues may be fixed with better design, system prompts and custom interfaces. But the temptation of using default-mode AI to avoid hard work will continue to be a more fundamental and classic problem of teaching, course design and motivating students to avoid shortcuts that undermine their cognitive workout.
As with other complex technologies such as smartphones, the internet or even writing itself, it will take more time for researchers to fully understand the true range of AI’s effects on cognition and learning. In the end, the picture will likely be a nuanced one that depends heavily on context and use case.
But what we know about learning tells us that deep knowledge and mastery of a skill will always require a genuine cognitive workout – with or without AI.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In remarks to the North Carolina AFL-CIO’s annual convention, Gov. Josh Stein pushed for more affordable housing, investments in education, and greater access to child care as part of a broader effort to lower the cost of living for workers.
“Our kids and grandkids should have a brighter future than we’ve had,” Stein told the crowd of about 300 labor activists and supporters in Wilmington. “Every person should have a fair shot at success, whether it’s starting a small business or getting a good paying job, everywhere in this state, including small town North Carolina.”
He touted the state’s ranking as best in the U.S. for business as well as 26,000 new jobs and $20 billion in investments in the state this year, but said that’s not enough: “I want to make sure that we’re the best state not only for business, but also for our working families.”
“A stronger North Carolina requires that we invest in our people so that folks have the skills and knowledge to succeed in an ever-changing economy,” he said. “A stronger North Carolina supports working families struggling with the rising cost of living.”
Stein said education should not only take the form of a four-year degree, adding that his office champions apprenticeships, workforce development, and technical education. He also called for more child care seats and more home building to accommodate the influx of new residents to North Carolina, the third fastest-growing state in the country.
He called on the General Assembly to do more to support education and invest in North Carolina’s workforce.
“There’s only one state in this country where what we spend per pupil today is less than what we spent in 2002 — I’m ashamed to say it’s North Carolina,” he said. “It’s embarrassing. We have to support our educators. Teachers are the number one in-school factor of students’ success. It is long past time we gave them a real pay raise.”
Stein made similar pleas for the General Assembly to invest in public safety by raising law enforcement salaries and to protect Medicaid expansion in the state amid federal cuts to health care. He decried the Trump administration’s impact on public services, especially where veterans are concerned.

“I want to talk a moment about how the federal government has not been delivering for people. Too many federal workers are experiencing job cuts. Veterans, in particular, are being impacted by loss of services,” he said. “It’s disgraceful, and it’s not the way to treat people who dedicated themselves to serving the public.”
He said his administration launched Join NC, an initiative to recruit qualified displaced workers to join the state government, in response to the federal cuts. “Rather than turning our back on workers, we celebrate them, and we give them our respect.”
“If we are successful in achieving that goal, the goal of building a state where everyone can thrive, it will be thanks to you,” Stein said. “You keep North Carolina working. You keep North Carolina moving forward.”
North Carolina AFL-CIO president MaryBe McMillan praised Stein for pushing to taking action against foreclosure scams and prioritizing health care and education as a state senator as well as combating price gouging, opioid abuse, and voter suppression as attorney general. The NC AFL-CIO has endorsed Stein in each of his campaigns for office in North Carolina.
“We fought hard to elect Governor Stein because he has a long history of fighting for us,” McMillan said.
At the conclusion of his remarks, Stein awarded McMillan with the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, in a surprise to the union president who is set to step down this week. “Well that was a nice surprise, y’all,” McMillan said.
Gwen Mills, president of UNITE HERE, a union that primarily represents hospitality workers throughout the United States and Canada, also lauded Stein during her remarks, calling his victory “one of the brightest spots” of last year’s elections. She said, however, that the labor movement must look beyond politicians, reminding her audience that “we’re responsible for us.”
“Unions were founded as empowering institutions, not supplicants asking for permission, and confused politicians think that the economy is them — they name it after themselves, like Reaganomics or Bidenomics,” Mills said. “Workers are the economy, and we have to claim it, no matter what politicians try to name it.”
Stein also met with film industry professionals in Bespoke, a Wilmington coffee shop and bar known for its appearance in “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” primarily filmed in the city.

During the press conference, Stein announced several film grant recipients, including Season 2 of “Beast Games,” the reality competition show hosted by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, an influential YouTube personality living in Greenville.
Stein told reporters after the discussion in Bespoke that the state needs to do more to attract investment in the state from film studios, citing the economic impact to local restaurants and shops as well as to local production companies and suppliers like lumber businesses. The state enjoyed more than $302 million of direct in-state spending by the film industry in 2024.
“The most painful thing for me in recent years is that they filmed ‘Outer Banks’ in South Carolina, I mean that is ridiculous,” Stein said. “We have to be attractive enough that when you have something that is written for your state, it can be filmed in your state.”
Stein also condemned the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zaruska in Charlotte in response to a reporter’s question.
“It’s just heartbreaking. This poor young woman left a war-torn region of the world to come to North Carolina for peace and for a future, and that future was tragically stripped from her in a horrific violent assault,” he said. “We have to make sure that everybody knows that when they are in public transit, whether it’s in Charlotte, Wilmington, or anywhere, that they are going to be safe.”
He said he encouraged Charlotte mayor Vi Lyles to surge the number of law enforcement personnel on public transit in the city, commending her for doing so. He also called for greater scrutiny of how individuals with mental illness are handled both by the court system and by social services.
Wednesday was the first day of the three-day convention for the NC AFL-CIO, during which they will elect a new union president. Convention-goers will also hear from state Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs and national AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler on Friday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9103642-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 05:56:16.188258

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia grapples with rapidly increasing energy demands and skyrocketing utility bills, a group of state lawmakers are looking deeper into energy efficiency, community solar, and energy storage.
The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation reviewed the state’s efforts to fund energy efficiency plans during virtual meetings on Wednesday. They also talked about the uncertainty around community solar investments and the rollout of energy storage plans.
Charts shared in the meeting by Carrie Hearne, the executive director of the commission, show that Virginia is 9th in electricity expenditure, which is higher than the national average. This energy use is due in part to the growing number of data centers across the state, which require large amounts of electricity. The state’s high energy expenditure also means that the cost burden for low-income households can be great.
Key recommendations from the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council include increasing investments into energy efficiency programs for low-income households to upgrade their homes and waste less energy. 
“Investments in energy efficiency is a very least-cost way to save money, save electricity, save energy, and help reduce pressure on the grid,” Hearne said. 
The council also recommended the state rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon credits market which previously was generating funds for the state to invest in energy efficiency and flood resilience programs. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the state out of RGGI, a move a judge deemed unlawful, and some lawmakers fear rejoining it will add yet another cost added onto customer’s utility bills.
“If we’re talking about affordability, anything we add to that, no matter what it is, it’s going to cost. So we need to be very careful about adding things to riders,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott.
The commission expressed interest in ramping up nuclear power through small modular reactors. SMRs are not currently operating in the country, but multiple are under construction in other states. Dominion Energy has already selected their North Anna power plant as the site of their first SMR. There is still a long road ahead that will entail selecting the proposals for the projects, getting the proposer licensing, and other requirements. 
The commission did not discuss utility sized solar projects, but did discuss the status of community solar in the commonwealth. Community solar allows neighborhoods to buy into small-scale solar projects to have their utility bills reduced based on how much power is generated and how much they bought in. 
However, if Dominion’s proposed changes to the minimum bill amount materialize, it could impact those savings. There hasn’t been much movement to expand this program in Virginia, and federal grants for it have recently been paused or terminated.
The Virginia General Assembly has failed to pass bills that would expand energy storage requirements, and ones that have passed have been vetoed by Youngkin. As long-term battery technology advances, some lawmakers are pushing utilities to utilize them more to assist with storing energy from solar and wind projects.
The American Clean Power Association, which represents companies in energy storage, solar, and wind, reported to the commission that there is 56 megawatts of battery storage operational in the state now, 252MW in construction, and 94MW in the proposal stage. There are many battery storage projects in the interconnection pipeline for the regional transmission grid, PJM, to approve. Dominion has multiple pilot projects in the works that look outside lithium-ion batteries as options for their projects.
“These pilots will deliver significant value, not only for the technology developers, they get to test their systems and real world conditions, but also to us, as we help de-risk the technical performance and cost effectiveness of these proposed three (projects),” said Brandon Martin with Dominion Energy. “The real world operating data validating the technology’s ability to enhance the resiliency of the grid and those claims and the cost benefits is real.”
The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation will hold more meetings this fall to get updates on the state’s energy profile and efforts by utilities to meet the VCEA transition to renewable energy sources. They plan to have recommendations for legislation by December.

That’s the unmistakable conclusion found in recent news articles about the use – or lack thereof – of “emergency substantial risk orders,” commonly known as the red flag law.
The state’s 2020 law allows police and sheriff’s deputies to take firearms from individuals or stop them from buying guns if they are a risk to themselves or others. Yet, most localities didn’t use the law at all last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported this summer.
That inaction must change. Gun control and gun rights advocates should agree on this, even though the hardened positions that both sides exhibit on firearms prevent consensus.
Such emergency orders work. True, it’s practically impossible to prove a negative about the lives saved or grief avoided. But several academic studies have shown the effectiveness of red flag laws around the United States.
A Duke University professor estimated in 2024, for example, that one suicide could be prevented for every 17 to 23 extreme risk protection orders that are issued. Columbia University researchers used computer modeling to show Florida’s red flag law reduced firearm homicides by about 11%.
And a 2019 study by researchers at the University of California at Davis identified 21 cases in which California’s red-flag law helped prevent a mass shooting.
“The bottom line, they’re effective,” Dr. Paul Nestadt, medical director of the Center for Suicide Prevention at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, told me. He’s co-author of a report released in June that studied gun suicides across the country.
The orders also help when people fear an abusive domestic partner will use a gun against them. “It could be a lifesaving thing,” Nestadt said. Nearly two dozen states and Washington, D.C., have red flag statutes.
The law in Virginia allows prosecutors, police or sheriffs to go to court to seek an ESRO against someone. Often, family members tell authorities of concerns about their relatives, or law enforcement officials receive tips about potential threats.
Within 14 days of issuing the order, a hearing in circuit court must be held to determine whether the decision can remain in effect for up to six months. The subjects of the order are guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor for buying, possessing, or transporting a firearm during that period.
The civil process can be extended for additional time. Authorities also return firearms after the immediate threat ceases.
Fairfax County used the orders far more than any other locality in 2024 and has been a strong supporter of them. Many localities, though, didn’t have a single ESRO last year. It’s as if they don’t know how to use them or are reluctant to seize firearms from residents.
Virginia State Police told me that since the law took effect in July 2020 through Sept. 2, 2025, authorities obtained 1,994 emergency orders statewide. Fairfax County had gotten 362 of that total through July, spokespersons with the county Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney told me. The county is the state’s largest locality, with roughly 1.2 million residents.
“This tool prevents tragedy,” said Steve Descano, the county’s top prosecutor and a big proponent of the policy. “It gets guns out of people’s hands that could be a danger to others.”
The office dedicates at least four attorneys to these cases (they also handle other duties). A special court docket takes place weekly. The county has run ads about the law, and it even has a link on the commonwealth’s attorney’s website that explains the process and lists the number of cases.
Other localities, though, have rarely used the tool – if at all. Nor is it clear whether local residents know the option is available; it could be valuable when a family member is having a mental health crisis.
Portsmouth did seize firearms from a resident after the person posted images on Facebook of weapons and threatened a local Walmart. That incident had taken place shortly after the mass shooting at a Walmart in nearby Chesapeake in November 2022.
A news report said it was the only time Portsmouth, a city of about 97,000 people, had sought an order in five years.
“We know it’s not being used as often as it could and should be,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Arlington and chief sponsor of the 2020 legislation in the state House. He told me more Virginians should know about the law, including doctors, emergency room staff and mental health professionals.
One case from Crozet this year is murky, but it raises serious questions about whether law enforcement authorities should have intervened more forcefully. Family members of Justin M. Barbour had notified local officials twice in the two months leading up to his Feb. 17 shooting rampage.
The shootings outside a grocery store left three people dead, including Barbour, 28. He didn’t know his victims.
If not for the presence of an off-duty federal officer, who shot and killed Barbour, more people could’ve been harmed. Barbour fired off 28 rounds within just 20 seconds.
During several earlier interactions with police, “Barbour presented a calm demeanor,” Albemarle County Police said in a March 6 statement. “There was no indication or evidence of violence, threats, or self-harm reported to police, which are the standard threshold to obtain an ECO (Emergency Custody Order) or Emergency Substantial Risk Order (ESRO).”
News reports, though, said family members had begged for help from the Albemarle police before Barbour’s rampage. A magistrate had denied an emergency custody order sought by the family in December.
A police department spokesperson, by email, told me the department didn’t seek an ESRO in court based on its contacts with Barbour and the information it had. Relatives, under the current law, can’t go to court directly to seek such an order; they need the intervention of police or prosecutors.
Clearly, family members should have that option. Authorities, too, should err on the side of caution to prevent such horrible violence.  
The red flag law in Virginia is no panacea. Potential acts of mayhem don’t always fit neatly into the law’s guidelines.
Yet imperfect as it may be, the law helps.
Localities should use every tool that can prevent a suicide or mass shooting. The inertia must stop.

Shelley Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), co-chairs of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, confer during a hearing about an audit of recent leasing practices by the Department of General Services. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Members of a legislative oversight committee expressed concerns Wednesday about what they see as a shift in state policy that could sharply curtail, if not end, the Department of General Services’ role in operating state government office buildings.
Members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee left the nearly three-hour hearing frustrated at a large-scale move of state offices from owned to leased space, with no documentation that the moves will save taxpayer money and are in the state’e best interests. The hearing raises the specter of potential legislation in the 2026 legislative session.
“We have a lot of follow up to do,” Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), co-chair of the committee, said after the hearing.
Solomon said he expects “a lot of additional conversations around the process when moving from ownership to lease,” making sure lawmakers and the Board of Public Works have adequate oversight and understanding of the shift. “It’s a big policy change, and I think we need to make sure that we’re doing it correctly,” he said.
General Services Secretary Atif T. Chaudry tried to assuage lawmakers’ frustrations by noting the hiring of a chief compliance officer to ensure cleaner future audits. And he told legislators his agency will work to develop a master plan for the state’s 30 million square feet of office space.

“This is the first time ever that the state is looking at all its leased and state-owned facilities holistically to make sure we as a state are spending the right resources in the right location,” Chaudhry said after the hearing. “Are we providing services in the right places?”
Chaudhry promised the plan would be “continually updated over time.”
“It’ll be a lot of work to do, but I want this to go on and sort of outlive us,” he said.
“There’s a clear … misalignment”
Wednesday’s sometimes contentious hearing followed a scathing 71-page audit that said DGS “could not support that $410.9 million in leases to relocate State agencies to downtown Baltimore were in the State’s best interest.”
Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) finalized plans to move state agencies out of a decaying Baltimore office complex, and current Gov. Wes Moore (D) has said he hopes to take advantage of a large amount of available commercial office space to negotiate “very aggressive lease rates.” Moore said those moves could save an estimated $326 million over 20- to 25-years, but auditors told lawmakers in July that they found no documentation to back up those claims.
The audit also raised significant questions about a lengthy lease for the Maryland Department of the Environment. Auditors questioned the 20-year term as well as the decision to forgo standard language that would let the state escape the lease and its annual rent increases. The report also questioned how $10 million in office improvements were rolled into the lease and how only the first-year costs of the agreement were specifically laid out to the Board of Public Works.
Chaudhry and the department rejected the report and its findings as “factually inaccurate.”
“There’s a clear … misalignment here between OLA [Office of Legislative Audits] and DGS on findings and our own assessment of things … particularly regarding the accountability mechanisms for real estate grants and construction,” said Chaudhry, who used the term “misalignment” nine times in his testimony.
More documentation “to buy my Corolla … and that’s frustrating”
Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen decided to forgo a presentation of the audit in his testimony and focus instead on the lengthy DGS response to it, which accounted for half the report.
Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen said his decision to buy a car, rather than lease, had more documentation than DGS provided for its decision to enter into a long-term lease for office space. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“Thirty-five pages filled with ‘not factually accurate, not factually accurate, not factually accurate,'” he said of the response. “What you do not see is one single number contradicting the specifics that we talked about.”
Tanen said he stood by the report “100% — not 99 — 100%.”
One example Tanen cited from the report was a 15-year lease at a cost of $200 million to move the Department of Health.
“We’re about to commit — not us, not the people on this committee, but my children and grandchildren — to a long-term lease,” Tanen said of that deal. But he said DGS did not provide documentation that the lease would save the state money.
“I have more documentation to support my decision to buy my Toyota Corolla than my team was able to find during the course of the audit to support a $200 million lease for the health department, and that’s frustrating,” Tanen told the committee.
Tanen, a 30-year veteran of state government, called the decision to move state government en masse to leased space “a once-in-a-lifetime, or once-in-my-career, experience, where we’re moving state agencies that historically have been in state-owned buildings. And it’s a complete change.”
“It’s the last guy’s fault”
Chaudhry testified that leases for departments moving out of the soon-to-be-vacated State Center complex were finalized under the Hogan administration, but that fell flat with Democrats and Republicans alike on the panel.
Del. Steven J. Arentz (R-Upper Shore) criticized that “it’s the last guy’s fault” defense, noting that many employees — including staff under Chaudhry — are holdovers.

“You sat back and said it was a previous administration,” Arentz said. “It’s not the previous [if] you have the same people working for you, sir, that you had before.”
Chaudhry was hired to the Maryland Department of Health during the Hogan administration, while other DGS employees were holdovers, including Wendy Scott-Napier, assistant secretary in the Office of Real Estate.
“I’m not interested in finger-pointing,” said Del. Andrea Fletcher Harrison (D-Prince George’s). “I really don’t care about what the past administration did and who did it, why they did it. What I do know is that in each level of government, regardless of who changes at the top, the majority of the people who are there have been there for years, and so they transcend administrations.”
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard), said he didn’t think the finger-pointing was “an approach that the committee really appreciated.”
“While it’s easy to kind of throw the prior administration under the bus — and I think there were a lot of things that didn’t go right then — I don’t think this is wholly under their responsibility,” Lam said. “I think there were a lot of decisions made here that were more recent than that. I’m not sure that we have better clarity in terms of steps moving forward to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
A lack of documentation
In other cases, Chaudhry said auditors didn’t ask for documentation and he contradicted auditors at the hearing who said they were never given any documentation. Solomon, in an exchange with Chaudhry, expressed frustration over a lack of documentation relating to the Health Department move.
Moving agencies out of State Center did not mean they had to move into leased properties, he said, and did not give DGS the right to not do its job and do a proper evaluation of “the cost benefit of a move versus a lease versus purchasing a new building elsewhere.”

Chaudry and his staff repeated claims of cost savings resulting from leases for departments moving out of the aging and decrepit State Center property in Baltimore. But lawmakers and the Office of Legislative Audits said they have nothing but the department’s word.
“I think what OLA is contending is that they did not find a lot of the documentation to back up a lot of those decisions,” Lam told Chaudhry . “And while you pointed out earlier that this documentation, I guess, was provided to OLA back in June of this year … in looking at Mr. Tanen, his reaction behind you, that misalignment seems like he doesn’t believe that they received that documentation.”
A three-page analysis of the health department move was eventually provided to the audit committee late Tuesday night. But committee members said it did not explain how the 15-year lease was cheaper for the state than purchasing and renovating another building.
A “workaround” for renovation costs
Also drawing scrutiny from the committee was the Department of the Environment’s  20-year lease at Montgomery Park in Baltimore. The deal — a renewal of an existing lease — locks the state in for two decades with no ability to terminate for convenience, a standard in most state leases.
In addition to a higher base lease rate and automatic increases, the lease included $10 million of renovation costs, including new cubicles. The costs of the work will be amortized over the life of the lease.
In its response to auditors, the department justified the adding the renovation costs into the lease because “the agency was unable to consider directly paying $10 million to reimburse the landlord for renovation costs due to budget constraints. The agency did not have a capital improvement budget available to support this expense but only had operating budget funds established in accordance with the prior lease.”
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel) said adding $10 million of renovations to a lease was “a workaround” to avoid the standard capital budget request process. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
Lam balked at the department’s reasoning.
“It seems like this is a workaround on the part of the department and the agencies that are your clients to be able to get the renovations that they want without having to go through the regular capital process,” Lam said.
Chaudhry responded that it was common to ask a landlord for renovations and include them in the cost of the lease.
“I would say that this is actually industry best practices, and this is a very good way to aggressively negotiate lease rates so we are able to pay fair-market rates for leases, or below fair-market rates, the rates and allow the landlord to build, to spend the money to build out the space for exact specifications,” he said.
Chaudhry, during and after the meeting, said the statement his department provided to the auditors was “taken out of context.”
Auditors published the statement as provided without additional comment.
After the meeting, Chaudhry said the “audit team” had taken the statement out of context.
But when asked if the department could have provided a better answer, Scott-Napier interjected saying, “We could have.”
Chaudhry then spoke over her.
“I think it’s a misalignment between OLA and DGS, and what I mean by that is they take information and they run with it, not being real estate experts,” Chaudhry said.
“Well, we are answering these questions and coordinating with them, with a lens of the real estate experts,” he said. “And I think part of that is translation, right? Translating into layman’s terms to be able to translate so non-real-estate experts can understand where we are coming from.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_2657-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 05:56:16.188258

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With recent legislation updating Maine’s definition of neglect so that it can no longer be confused with poverty, child welfare officials are working on ways to take the change beyond semantics. But they are finding a challenge in ensuring all mandated reporters are up to speed. 
“It’s not just a change in statute. It’s actually a change in practice and that’s what we want to see happening in the field, on the ground when we’re working with families,” said Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services. 
In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation to update the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect that legal experts have argued is easy to conflate with poverty. The proposal had an emergency preamble, so it took effect immediately upon her signature.
The updated definition distinguishes between whether a parent or caregiver is willfully withholding a child’s essential needs and their financial ability to provide them. Johnson spoke with the Maine Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on Tuesday about the ways her agency is trying to bring that distinction into practice. 
Johnson said her staff reviewed current child welfare policies and practices for areas that need updated language, further changes or additional guidance to be in line with the new definition. The agency has held town halls for staff to ask questions about the policy change, she added.
Gap in Maine’s mandated reporter law raises questions about accountability for missed reports

She also said mandated reporter training materials have been updated to include information about the change and scenarios of poverty that wouldn’t rise to the updated standards for neglect. For example, a child disclosing that there isn’t enough food at home or becoming unhoused because their caregivers can’t afford to pay rent. 
Mandated reporters are a usual conduit between children who are abused or neglected and the state’s child welfare system. State law requires professionals who are likely to come in contact with infants and other children to alert the appropriate authorities of potential abuse or neglect.
However, mandated reporters are only required by law to be trained once every four years, so Johnson said the agency is faced with a challenge of making sure that reporters who aren’t scheduled to reup their training are aware of the new law.
There are thousands of mandated reporters in the state, such as teachers and medical providers, but Johnson said her agency doesn’t keep a roster of them all. Instead, she said they can send information to schools, medical practices and other social services agencies that employ mandated reporters and ask them to share that information. 
Committee co-chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York), who is a former educator, asked Johnson about reaching out to the state Department of Education about an updated training, which she said they are looking into.
Rep. Lucien Daigle (R-Fort Kent), who has been a dentist for over 40 years, said he worked for an organization that did a virtual mandated reporter training annually. Though it was redundant when there weren’t changes to the law, he said refreshing that knowledge every year was important.

Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said in a cosponsorship memo that the bill would honor the Wisconsinites who have died by suicide including former Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, who killed himself in 2024. 
“We all deserve to live free from the fear of gun violence — whether that be in public or in the comfort of our homes. Last year, many of us in the Capitol lost a dear friend in Jonathan Brostoff, and there are many more people around the state who died by suicide using a gun,” Roys said in a statement. “It is our hope that we can honor their memories by offering a helping hand to anyone who is struggling with thoughts of self-harm.” 
The lawmakers said the bill is picking up on the work of Brostoff, who was an advocate for improving access to mental health services. During his time in the Legislature, Brostoff also served as a member of the 2019 Speakers’ Task Force on Suicide Prevention.
Lawmakers, many of whom served with him, honored him on the floor of the Legislature earlier this year. 
After Brostoff’s death, Gov. Tony Evers called on lawmakers to pass a similar policy.
“A big part of preventing gun suicide is access to intervention: the time and space between the person and the firearm are crucial,” the lawmakers said in a memo. 
According to a 2025 report from the The Center for Gun Violence Solutions and The Center for Suicide Prevention at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, gun-related suicides in the U.S. reached record highs in 2023 with 27,300 — or 58% — of all gun deaths being suicides; 90% of suicide attempts involving guns are fatal.
The Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) would be required to maintain a list under the bill. The proposal would provide $150,000 in state funding to the Department of Justice for the purposes of maintaining the list. 
A person would be able to request a prohibition for one year, five years with the first year being irrevocable or a 20-year period with the first year being irrevocable. 
The prohibition could be removed if someone submitted a request to the DOJ outside of the irrevocable period. After receiving a request for the revocation of a prohibition, the DOJ would have to wait 48 hours to remove the person from the database. 
Snodgrass said in a statement that people experiencing suicidal ideation need ways to protect themselves. 
“A constituent came to me in a time of crisis, feeling helpless that when they hoped to add themselves to a ‘do not sell’ list, found there was no process and no such list,” Snodgrass said. “Thankfully, my constituent is thriving today and we are grateful for their advocacy on this issue to help save lives in the future.”
A “Do Not Sell” list — also known as a ‘Voluntary Prohibition of Handgun Purchases’ list — has been adopted in a handful of other states, including Washington, Utah and Virginia. Reporting from The Trace in 2024 found that within the six years only about 130 people had participated in the program.

(Getty Images)New Hampshire has been slower than the rest of New England to lean into renewable electricity generation, including through solar power. And while some opportunities to change that will likely arise during the upcoming legislative session, it’s not yet clear whether lawmakers will have an appetite to pursue them.
Some clean energy advocates view expanding solar as an accessible route toward more widespread renewable energy capacity in New Hampshire, said Sen. David Watters, a Democratic member of the state Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee since 2019.
“Solar is kind of the low-hanging fruit if we want to do something about renewable energy and reducing costs for New Hampshire people,” he said.
Yet, in New Hampshire, approximately 2% of electricity was generated through solar power as of spring 2025 — far less than the other New England states’ average of about 15%, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. 
“The climate’s the same as in all the neighboring states, of course,” said Dan Weeks, vice president of business development at ReVision Energy, a solar system installer that operates across northern New England. What’s different, then, he and others said, is New Hampshire policymakers’ historic reticence around the development of solar infrastructure.
Divided on incentives
Part of that stems from an overarching debate in the New Hampshire solar landscape: To what extent should the state encourage solar development through subsidies and other incentives?
Some consider such pro-solar measures counterproductive for ratepayers and, therefore, not worth the investment, said Rep. Michael Vose, a Republican from Epping who chairs the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee. Vose said he would not abide by proposals to implement ratepayer-borne subsidies when electricity costs in New England are already among the highest in the contiguous U.S. 
“Those subsidies come from ratepayers,” he said. “To keep (electricity) as affordable as possible is an imperative … so we have resisted the temptation to overspend on energy subsidies for renewable energy and energy efficiency, in order to keep our rates lower.”
Concerns that solar development unfairly shifts a cost burden onto ratepayers are not new. Former Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed multiple proposed expansions to net metering, a program through which energy customers who own generation equipment are reimbursed for the electricity they generate at their property. In a 2019 veto message, Sununu called that program regressive and outlined concerns it would raise rates for those who did not engage in the program. He expressed similar concerns after vetoing another expansion bill in 2023.
A 2022 study on the effects of net metering in New Hampshire, conducted by Montreal-based consulting firm Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, concluded that the practice would cause an increase of about 1% to the energy bills of customers who do not use net metering – about $1.70 per month for a family paying a typical monthly electric bill of $170.
And solar advocates say the increased uptake of solar has a longer-term benefit to all consumers across the network that outweighs that amount.
A healthy base of solar capacity can reduce the load on the electrical grid at times of peak use, such as hot summer days when air conditioning units are working overtime, Weeks said. At those times, solar arrays’ productivity and peak regional energy demand is typically aligned, correlated to the hottest times of day.
The result is a solar buffer that can help protect the grid from hitting the ceiling of peak demand, at which time electric providers must switch on expensive, emergency power stations to feed the grid. The cost of electricity climbs steeply when demand is highest, Weeks said. But solar can help stave off those emergency measures.
This principle was particularly visible in New England this June, when a buffer from behind-the-meter solar — meaning arrays installed at the site of use, such as residential rooftop panels — saved consumers an estimated $8.2 million in peak electricity pricing on one particularly hot day, according to a report by renewable energy advocacy nonprofit The Acadia Center.
Most of the solar panels in existence across New Hampshire are residential solar panels and other small arrays. In some cases, Watters said, this may be because groups looking to develop larger projects have taken them to neighboring states where more incentives are available.
Vose said the reason that new energy projects were not arriving in New Hampshire was multifaceted and pointed to the high cost of construction in New England generally.
“It’s a difficult environment to make money,” Vose said.
He also pointed to past measures he said were intended to encourage energy development in the state – such as House Bill 609, signed by Sununu in July 2024, which streamlined the site approval process for proposed energy projects.
“Unfortunately, it hasn’t been tested yet, because there haven’t been any projects proposed,” he said.
Vose also said he did not expect to see the Republican-majority House reconsider their stance on solar subsidies or other incentives in the near future.
New Hampshire Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis said New Hampshire’s comparative lack of solar was due to the state not courting developers as aggressively as neighboring states. But as those governments back off on their own subsidies and incentives, he said, New Hampshire may be well poised to take advantage of the market and develop its own infrastructure with direct investment from ratepayers.
Budget cuts and dwindling funds
The amount of funding available for all renewable energy projects in New Hampshire has diminished greatly over the course of the past year.
Just this July, the New Hampshire Department of Energy received notice that the $43.5 million the state was set to receive through the federal “Solar for All” program had been rescinded. The funds were part of a nationwide program that was, until its termination, set to disburse about $7 billion in already promised funding to 60 organizations including states and tribes. The funds were earmarked to help bring solar energy projects to low-income households.
Plans for New Hampshire’s portion of the funds included adding community solar projects and collectively owned solar arrays statewide, including projects for manufactured housing parks, publicly owned housing, and workforce housing sites, according to an April 2024 press release from the New Hampshire Department of Energy. The New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority and New Hampshire Community Loan Fund were sub-grantees in the project.
In the release, Rob Dapice, New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority executive director, said he expected the project to reduce utility costs for residents and housing developers alike.
The New Hampshire Department of Energy appealed the grant’s termination to the EPA, Deputy Commissioner Christopher Ellms said in an email to the Bulletin on Sept. 5. In the dispute, dated Aug. 28, Division of Policy and Programs Director Joshua Elliott called the termination “arbitrary and capricious” and requested the funds be restored.
Other federal cuts under the Trump administration have also diminished the amount of funds available for renewable energy projects, including the termination of the residential clean energy credit, which reimbursed homeowners up to 30% of the cost of a qualifying renewable energy project for their home but is set to end Dec. 31.
And at the state level, the budget bill signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in August will transfer the millions of dollars accrued in New Hampshire’s renewable energy fund — and all incoming revenue — to the general fund over the next two years. As a result, about $15 million otherwise earmarked for clean energy and energy efficiency development across the state will be sent to the general fund for use elsewhere, leaving about $1 million per year available in the fund for investing in renewable energy.
Looking ahead
Though legislators and advocates said they did not expect sweeping solar policy developments to find traction in the next legislative session, some more incremental developments may be on the horizon.
One of those includes a possible bill to streamline the adoption of so-called plug-in, or balcony, solar, said Watters. These portable solar panels can be less expensive than traditional rooftop arrays, and plug directly into a socket. Watters said he was considering legislation to help chart a more straightforward path for New Hampshire residents to put the technology to use.
“The technology is there. There’s a lot of good devices that people can buy,” Watters said. “…If they’re potentially a renter, or are in a situation where they can’t do rooftop, this is a possibility for some solar development.”
Battery technology is another arm of the solar industry developing rapidly in neighboring states, said Weeks. Batteries installed along with solar panels allow residents to save surplus power they generate rather than feeding it directly to the grid; through agreements with utilities, this power can sometimes be tapped into in times of peak demand to further stave off the need for emergency plants, Weeks said.
“These programs have been shown to save all ratepayers, whether you have solar or not, a lot of money,” he said.
Residents with battery systems in place may be able to benefit further through a bill Vose said he was considering that would allow users to be reimbursed through net metering for the power stored in their batteries in addition to the power generated in real time through their panels.
Net metering itself is another matter advocates hope the state will take up once again in the upcoming session.
When New Hampshire’s net metering rules were last updated in 2017, Weeks said, they allowed for projects to be guaranteed participation in net metering through 2040. But as time goes on and that deadline nears, uncertainty has grown about the future of the program — and that, Weeks said, could put would-be developers on edge.
“With each passing year, the time horizon is shorter and shorter, down to 15 years now, and that is also discouraging investment in solar,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/solarqueue-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-11 05:56:16.188258

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)With less than a week before the Annapolis primary election, Democratic mayoral candidates Rhonda Pindell Charles and Jared Littmann presented their cases during a debate Wednesday on why they should be the next mayor of Annapolis.
The winner in Tuesday’s primary election will face Republican Bob O’Shea, who has no primary challenger but still participated in Wednesday’s debate at the Boys and Girls Club of Annapolis. They are running to replace Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two four-year terms.
While he faces no primary challenge, O’Shea will face a challenge in the Nov. 4 general election in a city where registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by a more than 2-1 ratio.
“I believe that everybody should have an opportunity, and I also believe in tough love,” said O’Shea, a local businessman who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2013 and state delegate in 2018. “Tough love is something that when someone does something, you scare them a little bit to not do it again.”
While O’Shea announce this summer, Littman got an almost two-year head start on the race, announcing his candidacy in January 2024. Pindell Charles officially announced her candidacy in September of last year.
The debate, hosted by the nonpartisan Action Annapolis, provided the candidates with questions in advance on quality of life, housing and improvement of city services.
Different responses came up when all three candidates were asked: “As mayor, what would you do differently from current and past administrations?”

Littmann, a small business owner who manages K&B Ace Hardware in the city with his wife, said he would like to instill a culture of customer service.
“Our city government needs to have that same sort of culture where we’re resident-focused,” said Littmann, who served on the city council for five years before his term ended in 2017.
“So often I hear complaints that it took me so long to get a response,” he said. “That’s not good customer service.”
O’Shea said he would ensure the city conducts shared services with Anne Arundel County and the state. In addition, he would “reduce redundancy,” making cuts at the administrative level and “not in the people that do the jobs.”
Pindell Charles, who has served as alderwoman on the city council since 2009, defended and supported the current and previous administrations and city workers. She also said the city already does shared services, or partnerships, such as public safety and procurement with the county.
“We have three stellar bond ratings and I think we [should] be proud of that,” Pindell Charles said. “Nevertheless, we need more focus on our working class and on our public and subsidized housing…  There’s always more to do.”
Among the written questions from the audience was whether the candidates would support legislation to install cameras in high-crime neighborhoods, and impose a financial penalty on property owners for nonworking cameras.
All three candidates support cameras in various communities, as long it can be done legally.
Pindell Charles said the financial penalty “could be something that’s definitely looked” into.
Littmann, who said he has cameras inside and outside his business, isn’t “too crazy about the idea of fining people for not putting up cameras … We have so many restrictions on businesses. Cameras are expensive. Maintaining them is expensive.”
O’Shea said property owners shouldn’t be the only ones to face a penalty.
“If you’re going to fine people because their camera isn’t working or there’s an issue whether you don’t have them up, those city cameras should also have some sort of penalty if they’re not working properly,” he said. “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”
Polls for the Sept. 19 primary election will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Win McNamee/Getty ImagesDonald Trump’s appointee as secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has set out to dismantle an Atlanta-based institution, attempting to transform the Centers for Disease Control, the planet’s pre-eminent public-health agency, into the Centers for Deluded Conspiracy, an official purveyor of pseudo-science and quackery.
And those with the power to stop Kennedy’s assault on the CDC lack the courage and wisdom to do so, while those who do have the courage to act lack the power to intervene. As a result, we are witnessing a tragedy play out before our eyes that will have consequences for decades.
If that sounds alarmist, let’s review who we’re dealing with in Kennedy.  
In the not-too-distant past, he has suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic was a “plandemic,” created by the pharmaceutical industry to drum up business for itself, with the CDC serving as the industry’s enforcer. It’s a familiar line of thinking for Kennedy, an echo of his earlier conspiracy theory that the attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001 may have plotted by the U.S. defense industry so it could keep selling arms and munitions.
Kennedy has said that there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. He has said that the polio vaccine has killed more people than it has saved. He has suggested that COVID-19 was “targeted” to kill certain ethnic groups, such as white and Black people, while making Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese immune. He also insists that vaccines and Tylenol cause autism, theories that are utterly without scientific basis.
Trump himself, the man who suggested that we could fight COVID by injecting bleach into our veins or letting the sun shine into places in our body where God did not intend the sun to shine, posted a vaccine-related meme this week on his Truth Social account claiming that “They’re ALL poison. Every. Single. One.”
Given their unquestioning faith in their leader, a lot of Trump supporters will probably be even more reluctant now to be vaccinated, or to allow their children to do so, and that will have consequences for them. But again, when powerful national leaders make health care policy based on such nonsense, even those of us who know better will pay a heavy price.
Living and working in Atlanta, I’ve met a lot of CDC employees. They are smart, they are honest, they are dedicated to science and to the mission of public health. Many have sacrificed more lucrative career paths because they wanted to be at the CDC, where so much important work was being done.
Imagine being someone like that and you’re told that to keep your job you have to pretend that vaccines do more damage than good, and other such nonsense. For a lot of CDC employees, they don’t have to imagine that scenario because they are living it.
In recent testimony to the U.S. Senate, Kennedy was asked why he had just fired Susan Monarez as CDC director, after just four weeks in the job.
“I told her that she had to resign because when I asked her whether she was a trustworthy person, and she said no,” Kennedy told the senators.
Somehow, I doubt that’s how the conversation actually went down. It seems far more likely that Kennedy asked Monarez whether she could be trusted to spew the pseudo-science that Kennedy demanded. When she refused, as integrity demanded, she was fired.
Monarez holds a doctorate in immunology and microbiology, with a long career of research into infectious diseases and other public-health issues. Her replacement as acting director of the CDC, Jim O’Neill, has a master’s degree in the humanities, but apparently Kennedy considers him “trustworthy.”
It’s easy to see why. Like Kennedy, O’Neill champions the use of ivermectin, a horse dewormer, to treat COVID. He believes that the government should allow the sale of unproved drugs and other treatments so that people can experiment on their own to find out if they work or not. Yeah, they may die unnecessarily, but it’s not the government’s job to protect them from such choices.
There have always been people who prefer to live in an alternate reality of their own design, as Kennedy, O’Neill and others do. We saw that at the peak of the pandemic, when some individuals stubbornly rejected the vaccine and medical science in favor of quack remedies such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. 
It was their choice, and many died as a result. 
But now, in our era of national madness, we have surrendered control of major agencies of the federal government to such people, not just at the CDC but at the Pentagon, the Department of State, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice. 
Now all of us are living in their alternate reality. Now all of us are at risk when actual reality reasserts itself, as it always does eventually. We can’t know what form that challenge will take, but we do know it will come, and the charlatans and conspiracy fools that we now have in charge will prove spectacularly unfit to meet it.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story)Ohio’s workers have seen a lot of changes in the last 25 years, according to a recent report by a state policy think tank, but those changes haven’t always been good for them.
Policies have favored “loopholes for the wealthiest and corporations, instead of policies that build the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up,” Policy Matters Ohio Researcher Heather Smith wrote in this year’s analysis.
In Policy Matters Ohio’s latest State of Working Ohio report, researchers review the last quarter-century in honor of the think tank’s founding.
The first State of Working Ohio report in 1999 showed a falling median wage, and workers who were producing more but being paid less than their parents in the previous 20 years.
Since 1999, the economy for workers in Ohio has shown disparities for men and women, people of color, and people of different education levels.
For instance, Black Ohioans saw the highest unemployment rates of any group in the state last year, an increase of nearly 4%.

Compared to 1999, the average Ohio worker does see more than $4 more in inflation-adjusted wages, and unemployment was the same in 2024 as it was in 1999, at 4.3%.
However, the employed population share dropped from 64% to 59.9% in the last 25 years, according to Policy Matters data.
The 2025 report attributed a focus from elected leaders on “‘business-friendly’ policies” as a reason for many of the changes to the economic outlook for Ohio workers, particularly a loss of opportunities for working Ohioans over the decades.
In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act was passed by a Republican U.S. Senate, a Democratic U.S. House, and signed by President Ronald Reagan, which included tax cuts for high income levels.
In 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed in Congress with most Republicans voting yes and Democrats deeply divided, and signed by President Bill Clinton, which led to outsourcing of jobs.
The report stated those policy choices, among others, hit directly at Ohio’s manufacturing industry, with the number of jobs in that sector decreasing by more than 30%.
“Between 2005 and 2019, General Motors moved or eliminated an estimated 8,245 jobs in favor of cheaper imports and low-wage foreign labor, harming thousands of workers in Lordstown alone,” Smith wrote in the report.
In the present day, Smith argued in the report, “Ohio’s leaders are now banking on mega-development deals to grow our economy, diverting resources to incentivize corporate investments, with a reckless disregard for accountability.”
“Headlines and some politicians over the last several years have championed these deals as signs Ohio is on the rebound,” the report stated. “However, the data show job growth and recession recovery has been concentrated in two regions in Ohio, and largely in central Ohio.”
The report referenced the Intel plan in Jersey Township, a semiconductor manufacturing project which has been delayed several times by the corporation.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno even called for a fraud investigation against the company because of the delays.
President Donald Trump blamed the struggles of the company on “bad management” as he announced a $9 billion investment to give the federal government a 10% stake in the company.
The Jersey Township plant was expected to be completed this year, but has now been set for a completion date in the 2030s.

In a June report Chishti wrote for the institute, he said the “self-deportation” strategy by the Trump administration is perhaps an acknowledgement that its goal of 1 million deportations a year “might be impossible through immigration enforcement alone, no matter how muscular.”
Immigration arrests fell in August compared with July and have not been close to a stated administration goal of 3,000 a day.
It’s hard to document how many immigrants might be choosing to leave under pressure from the Trump administration. Thousands have shown a new interest in leaving on social media, in court and through a new government app offering a plane ticket and $1,000 for those without legal immigration status. Trump officials have touted a drop in the immigrant population this year as a sign of success, but researchers say fear of responding to surveys may play a role in the data.
ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

A 22-year-old Oklahoma woman, brought to the U.S. as a child, told Stateline she’s leaving for her native Mexico on a flight this month to start a new life.
Living in Mexico may be hard, but the threat of arrest and detention after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed, giving extra funding for immigration enforcement, was too much for her.
“It’s tough. I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known. I speak Spanish, but not the best. My thoughts are in English. I have to readapt to everything,” she said.
“More than anything, I’m tired of being called a criminal here,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, fearing interference with her flight.
“I was in leadership in high school. I was in the marching band. I have a college degree here. I am not a criminal, and this is not OK, what’s happening now,” said the woman, who said her parents brought her at the age of 6 on a tourist visa.
She didn’t qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, because her family took her on trips back to Mexico, she said, returning on new tourist visas.
“I am 22 years old now and undocumented,” she said, “I can’t speak to my parents’ actions. I know there’s issues with legality in that and they made choices that were not favorable. I was a child.”










I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known.

Discussions abound on Reddit, an online chat site, about whether to take a government offer to leave or continue to face the threat of arrest and detention if not deportation.
“After over 20 years of living here illegally (I was brought here as a toddler) I think now is finally the time to throw in the towel. I simply do not belong in the US nor am I wanted here,” one man, who said he was born in Mexico, wrote this month in a chat group for Mexican expatriates.
“I’ve worked in construction a large part of my adult life so I have some money saved up, but no career,” he added. “I just feel tired of not being able to do anything meaningful with my life here. I can’t get a driver’s license. I have no hope of ever retiring when I grow old and I can’t even get a real job.”
The Trump administration is using a “potent combination of carrots and sticks” to encourage immigrants without legal status to leave, according to the Migration Policy Institute report. High-profile arrests at workplaces, homes, court hearings and even citizenship interviews have “generated intense nervousness” while poor conditions in detention centers and the threat of removal to unknown countries create “a palpable fear of arrest,” the report stated.
The Department of Homeland Security has a cellphone app — called CBP Home — that offers a plane ticket and $1,000 to “illegal aliens” wishing to leave. The department told Stateline, in a statement attributed only to a senior official, that “tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app” but did not provide further detail.

Thousands more people have accepted voluntary departure rather than fight immigration court cases and take a chance on arrest and detention. The Pew Research Center found that the overall immigrant population dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million in June, though the change could be due partly to a heightened fear of responding to surveys among immigrants.
In another sign of increased appetite for leaving the country, a social media group helping such people decide has seen soaring membership.
The group, Onward, was started by three DACA recipients who moved abroad during the first Trump administration. It has seen 10,000 join requests this year, more than triple the interest it’s had previously in its four years of existence, said Jason Hong, a founding member. Hong was born in South Korea, brought to the U.S. as a child, grew up in New Jersey, and has opted to live in Spain. There, he is a legal resident and has an opportunity for Spanish citizenship. U.S. citizenship wasn’t an option under DACA.
“If I want to shoot for citizenship here, I can,” Hong said. “For the time being I want to focus on helping others who are making the same decision.”
Another Onward founder, Monsy Hernández, left South Carolina during the first Trump administration in 2017, settling in Germany.
“I was very traumatized with the discrimination I faced in the United States when my mom was put into one of the ICE detention centers. I just wanted to go somewhere where no one knew that I was Mexican,” Hernández said. “I thought, OK, if I’m in Germany, I will be very, very far away from that discrimination.”
Trump administration vows to ‘come after’ sanctuary states and cities, despite court setbacks

Widespread departure of immigrants is almost unprecedented in the U.S. history, Chishti said, though there was a large-scale return of Italian immigrants in the 19th century. They were known in Italy as “ritornati” — a wave of farmers and laborers who arrived here when work was scarce in their home country, then returned home with their savings after a few years, when economic conditions in Italy improved.
More recently, some people from Mexico returned home when work dried up during the 2008 Great Recession.
But the current departures under pressure and threats from the U.S. government seems to be unprecedented, Chishti said. In some cases, parents have been pressured to leave the country or face separation from their children.
Voluntary departure is also an option to settle immigration court cases, and more people are taking that route. In those cases, immigrants must pay their own way and can’t have a conviction for a serious crime. Choosing voluntary departure can get immigrants released from detention and avoid a removal order that could cause them to be permanently barred from returning.
According to federal statistics obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Stateline, 6,118 people were granted voluntary departure between Jan. 20 and July 29, the latest figures available, compared with 2,550 for the same time period last year during the Biden administration. For both years, the majority of cases involved citizens of Mexico returning to Mexico.

(Photo courtesy of Ash Hebert)Penobscot County, Maine, is grappling with the largest HIV outbreak in the state’s history. Home to Bangor, a city of roughly 32,000, the county has identified 28 new cases over nearly two years. That’s seven times the typical number for that length of time. Nearly all cases are among people who use drugs and are homeless.
Public health experts and local advocates say the outbreak is fueled by a confluence of on-the-ground factors: the sidelining and closing of programs that distributed sterile syringes to people who use drugs, a shortage of medical providers focused on HIV, and the clearing of the city’s largest homeless encampment, which upended care for newly diagnosed people living there.
But those issues may not remain local for long.
The Trump administration is pushing similar tactics nationwide. In a recent executive order, Trump called for defunding programs that engage in harm reduction — a broad term that encompasses many public health interventions, including syringe services, aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. Such efforts are sometimes controversial, with critics saying they enable illegal activity. The executive order also supports forcing homeless people off the street and into treatment. This comes after the administration cut or delayed funding for various addiction and HIV-related programs and hollowed out federal agencies focused on these topics.
The administration says its approach will increase public safety, but decades of research suggest otherwise. Many advocates and researchers warn these efforts could spark more outbreaks like the one in Bangor.
“That feels inevitable,” said Laura Pegram, director of Drug User Health for NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.
She said people who use drugs face a trifecta of risks: HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose. “Across the country, I think we’ll start to see those three things starting to be on the rise again.”
“That will be incredibly costly,” she added — in dollars and “in a real human way.”
Outbreaks that start among people who use drugs can easily spread to those who don’t.
Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, was a Bangor-area nonprofit that distributed more than half a million sterile needles a year to people who use drugs. The organization ran out of supplies repeatedly in the lead-up to the first HIV case of the current outbreak in October 2023, and it shut down in early 2025. (Photo courtesy of Amy Clark)
An HIV outbreak
The first HIV case in Bangor’s current outbreak appeared in October 2023, well before Trump’s return to the presidency.
Puthiery Va, director of Maine’s public health department, attributed the emergence to the opioid epidemic, housing shortages, and the greater Bangor area’s sparse health care services.
Local advocates highlighted an additional, acute factor: supply shortages at the region’s largest syringe services program and its subsequent closure.
A nonprofit that provided health care and social services to people who use drugs, Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, distributed more than half a million sterile needles annually.
Like other such programs nationwide, its goal was to prevent the spread of infectious disease that can occur if people share needles to inject drugs.
However, financial struggles and mismanagement led to severe shortages in recent years. Former HEAL executive director Josh D’Alessio acknowledged such issues, telling KFF Health News, “We did run out of syringes” at times or limit how many participants could take. Several of these shortages struck in the fall of 2023, leading HEAL staffers to suggest a link to the first HIV case.
The future of harm reduction
Research suggests a strong connection between past HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs and lack of access to sterile needles, said Thomas Stopka, an epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine.
A 2015 outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, and one in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts a few years later were curbed only after syringe services programs ramped up, he said. If such programs had existed sooner in Scott County, more than a hundred infections could have been prevented, one study suggested.
Va, who leads the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said she considers the shortage of syringe services in the Bangor area to be a factor in the outbreak but not the primary cause.
Stopka said the best practice during an outbreak “is to amplify access to sterile syringes.”
But Trump’s recent executive order links harm-reduction programs to crime, saying such efforts “only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.” The order doesn’t name syringe services programs — which have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past — but it targets “safe consumption” sites, where people can use drugs under supervision. Many advocates worry the attacks will be broader.
A letter from the nation’s leading addiction agency expanding on Trump’s executive order said federal funds cannot be used to buy syringes or drug pipes. However, that has been true for most of the past few decades. The letter did not address supporting general operating costs for syringe services programs.
Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News that the administration is committed to “addressing the addiction and overdose crisis impacting communities across our nation.” But he and spokespeople for the White House did not respond to specific questions about the administration’s stance toward syringe services.
In Bangor, some locals have raised concerns about harm reduction that echo the president’s. At a March 2024 City Council meeting — shortly after a syringe services program was newly certified by the state to operate locally — residents and business owners said they felt unsafe with the growing population of people who were homeless and using drugs. They worried syringe programs were fueling the behavior.
But research suggests syringe services programs reduce discarded needles in the community and do not increase crime. They can halve new HIV and hepatitis C cases, increase entry into addiction treatment fivefold, and save taxpayer money. They are also leading distributors of overdose reversal medications, the use of which many communities — and the Trump administration — have said they support.
The city ultimately decided the newly certified program, Needlepoint Sanctuary, could not operate in prominent public parks or squares.
In the following months, Needlepoint ran its syringe services only at the city’s largest homeless encampment, where several people had tested positive for HIV, said the group’s executive director, William “Willie” Hurley. That ended in February when the city cleared the encampment.
This summer, Needlepoint secured a private location for its syringe services but shut it down five days later when city officials raised zoning concerns.
Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor’s health department, said the city is trying to strike a balance between “making services available and what the community wants.”
“Getting the buy-in of most of the community” is “critical to the future of harm reduction,” she said.
Other cities in Maine and beyond have seen backlash result in new laws that restrict how syringe services programs operate or shutter them.
Gunderman said she is hoping to avoid that in Bangor.

Clearing encampments
Trump’s recent executive order also calls for clearing homeless people off the street and involuntarily committing them to treatment facilities.
The administration is enacting this policy in Washington, D.C., where it has bulldozed tents and threatened homeless people with fines and jail time if they don’t leave the streets.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said people have the option to be taken to a shelter or receive addiction and mental health services.
Similar policies have taken hold nationwide in recent years, even in liberal hubs like New York and California.
Last year in Bangor, as a homeless encampment that had existed for several years grew to nearly 100 residents, business owners and locals called for its clearing.
Some advocates and social service providers warned that doing so could exacerbate the HIV outbreak and overdose crisis. At two City Council meetings in November, they explained that it would be difficult to find people they served after a clearing and that scattering newly diagnosed people could spark HIV clusters elsewhere.
“Plenty of people said you’re going to lose track of these people,” Amy Clark, a board member for the Bangor Area Recovery Network, told KFF Health News. “They did it anyway.”
‘I’m still alive’
Two months after clearing the encampment, the city reported not knowing the location of more than a third of the people who had lived there.
Clark said it’s not surprising that the city couldn’t connect everyone to housing or treatment. Many people distrust these services, shelters are frequently full, and treatment services are scarce. “Where exactly are these people supposed to go?” she said.
City officials stressed in Council meetings and reports that they were taking a humane approach. They ramped up social services for months leading up to the clearing, connecting people to everything from housing to storage facilities and laundry.
Gunderman, the city health director, said she knows the sweep wasn’t ideal but that neither was crowding folks in an unsanitary encampment. “It was a situation where there weren’t a lot of great answers,” she said.
To help track folks from the encampment and keep them engaged in HIV treatment, the city is now using about $550,000 in opioid settlement funds to hire two case managers. (The only other local HIV medical case management program shuttered over the summer.)
“What we know from outreach we’ve been doing already is that we spend a lot of time looking for people,” Gunderman said.
Jason, who has been homeless for most of the past decade and tested positive for HIV this year, has seen that in action.
Members of what he calls his medical team have scoured the streets for hours to find his tent and remind him to take his HIV treatment shots, he said. Some picked up prescriptions and delivered them to him.
“They’ve made sure I’m taken care of,” Jason said. (KFF Health News agreed to use only his first name to protect his privacy.)
Jason believes he got the virus last year at the homeless encampment while using drugs that someone else prepared. He had tried to avoid the encampment for months. But whenever he set up his tent elsewhere, he said, police officers told him to move.
When he got the diagnosis, he thought of his uncle, who died of AIDS in the 1980s.
“It hurts to talk about,” Jason said, “but I’m still alive.”
After months of treatment, his viral load is now undetectable. Over the summer, his team helped him find housing.
But Jason is still struggling to find sterile needles regularly. He worries about others facing a shortage.
“That’s how this outbreak has been spreading more and more,” Jason said. “Every time we turn around there’s another case.”

(Google Data Centers)
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is giving American Electric Power the green light to start charging data centers differently. The decision is another acknowledgement of the strain large energy consumers are placing on the grid.
In a press release, the Ohio Consumer’s Counsel praised the commission for ensuring data centers “pay their own way.”
The PUCO’s latest decision set aside an appeal brought by tech interests like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft as well as the Ohio Manufacturers Association. But that might not be the final word.
The deep-pocketed companies fueling Ohio’s data center boom can still appeal to the state supreme court. The Ohio Manufacturer’s Association is already promising to do so, saying the recent ruling leaves them “no choice.”
Case background
In May of last year, AEP applied with the PUCO to establish a new tariff for data centers.
In the energy context, a tariff is the contract for service outlining what’s expected of the supplier and the customer.
AEP, for instance, has different tariffs for all sorts of customers like schools, churches, fairs, automakers, and more.
From the company’s point of view, a separate set of rules for data centers is just one more example, and entirely appropriate given the unique demands data centers impose.

In its decision, the PUCO leaned heavily on testimony from AEP officials like Vice President of Transmission Planning and Analysis Kamran Ali.
He explained in 2023, Central Ohio accounted for 4,000 MW of the state’s roughly 9,400 MW peak load.
Ali testified by 2030, the company has signed agreements to connect another 4,000 MW — or the entire current Central Ohio energy demand — from data centers alone.
What’s more, there are another 30,000 MW worth of proposed projects hoping to get online.
In its application, AEP said it was “resolute and unwavering in its conclusion that an updated set of terms and conditions for retail service to data center customers is needed in order to move forward with capacity expansion plans on a just and reasonable basis.”
AEP’s initial proposal applied to data centers using more than 25 MW a month.
The company asked that data center customers should be subject to a billing minimum, and a ‘load ramp’ that would increase year to year as facility gets up to speed.
AEP also proposed and an exit fee if the data center decided to pull up stakes before their contract expires.
The motivation for all those conditions, AEP said, was to ensure they’re not on the hook if a proposed data center never materializes, and infrastructure investments are borne by “those that caused the need,” rather than getting spread across the rest of AEP’s consumers.
Ohio electric bills likely to keep going up after latest PJM auction

Several tech and manufacturing interests aligned around a counterproposal that lumped data centers in with other energy intensive customers but pushed the minimum demand threshold up to 50 MW.
Among other changes, the proposal dialed back billing minimums, offered a gentler ramp up period, and made it easier for companies to exit.
The PUCO decided to go with a version of AEP’s proposal negotiated with the Ohio Consumers Counsel and a handful of other interests instead.
Following that decision in July, PUCO Chair Jennifer French said, “Today’s order represents a well-balanced package that safeguards non-data center customers on an industrial and residential level while establishing a dependable and reasonable environment for data centers to continue to thrive within Ohio.”
The appeal and what’s next
Early last month, data center interests petitioned the PUCO to take a second look.
In its filing, the Data Center Coalition argued the PUCO-approved settlement “is a knee-jerk, reactive response to the surge of data center interest,” that unlawfully discriminates against data centers based on their line of business.
The group added AEP never presented formal studies to back up claims that the new tariff would ensure the users driving demand bear the actual cost of infrastructure upgrades.
But the PUCO batted away those arguments as already asked and answered. The commission reiterated its determination that “actual, material differences” in the service that data centers support a separate tariff.
With 30,000 MW of potential data center demand in the offing, PUCO added, “there is a timely need for a proactive solution to address potential reliability issues in the AEP Ohio central Ohio region, which is specifically driven by data centers.”
Ohio Consumer’s Counsel Maureen Willis applauded the PUCO “for standing up for AEP’s consumers instead of giving into the demands of power-hungry data centers.”
But perhaps underscoring the unlikely partnership with AEP, Willis added her office isn’t giving the utility a free pass.
She said they’re investigating AEP’s pending rate case, “where the utility’s infrastructure investment has nearly doubled in just five years, contributing to rising bills for Ohio families. We urge the PUCO to continue to focus on fair cost allocation and affordability in that case.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to several parties in the case about whether they plan to appeal.
Data Center Coalition Director of Energy Policy Lucas Fykes said they’re still “reviewing our options.”
“As DCC indicated throughout the proceeding,” he added, “the data center industry is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses,” and that they’d work on “evidence-based solutions” to support data center development.
The Ohio Manufacturer’s Association, however, came out swinging.
“It’s disappointing,” OMA said in a statement, “that the PUCO decided to uphold discriminatory tariffs on energy-intensive users, creating a slippery slope for utilities to potentially punish industrial and other high-energy users.”
OMA insisted PUCO’s rationale was “deeply flawed, based upon overstated and double-counted speculative load by AEP.”
The organization said it has no choice but to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio will continue promoting the benefits of vaccines and supporting vaccinations, despite some Republican leaders casting doubt on their legitimacy and Florida making an effort to ban requirements.
Gov. Mike DeWine and Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff will continue following the decades of science that show vaccines are safe, DeWine’s team said.
The percentage of kids starting kindergarten with their vaccinations continues to decline on a state and national level for diseases like diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, mumps and polio.
In the 2019-2020 school year, vaccination rates were at 89.9%, Vanderhoff said. Those numbers are now down to 85.4%, a 4.5% decrease over five years.
But state Rep. Beth Liston’s family is not one of the overall vaccine rate decreases.
“I get my kids every vaccine available,” Liston (D-Dublin) said.
She is a pediatrician and is worried about anti-vaccine rhetoric across the country.
“There are a lot of diseases that we can prevent, and a lot of health problems, including death, that… would have come from that, had we not had vaccines,” Liston said.
In a congressional hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he believes that many vaccines cause harm, an argument refuted by medical experts. He has also pulled funding from vaccine development and fired CDC officials.
“We are the sickest country in the world; that’s why we have to fire people at the CDC,” RFK Jr. said. “They did not do their job. This was their job, to keep us healthy.”
The “Make America Healthy Again” campaign is also at work in Ohio. House Bill 112 would make it illegal to discriminate against someone who refuses to get a vaccine. The sponsors said they could not go on camera to speak about it, but sponsor Rep. Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester) introduced the same bill last year.
“Ohioans are being forced to put aside their conscientious or religious beliefs or face the reality that they may be unable to operate as productive members of our state, face job loss or denial of education or job training,” Gross said in 2024.
Other sponsor state Rep. Beth Lear gave us a comment, saying, “When states, including Ohio, began mandating untested and unproven mRNA shots as a condition of employment and education, I and many others around the state and nation awoke to the massive government overreach that was taking place.”
Doctors have continuously argued that the COVID-19 vaccine was tested and proven to work and be safe.
“If vaccines are truly safe and effective, then they will be in high demand and there is no need for mandates,” Lear said.
Misinformation leads to a lack of demand, Liston said.
Gross also posted on social media that she supported Florida’s new effort to ban all vaccine mandates, including for children. Lear said she agreed.
The roadblock for the vaccination bill will likely be the governor. DeWine has been a longtime supporter of vaccines and the welfare of children. He has previously vetoed legislation he deemed to be against public health.
California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii have formed a coalition to provide “credible information” and combat the Trump administration. Northeastern states, like Massachusetts, have started working together on their own coalition, as well, according to Gov. Maura Healey.
“While the state does get involved in compacts from time to time, and certainly, we coordinated with states during the pandemic on certain things… We did things the Ohio way and put out Ohio recommendations.” DeWine’s spokesperson, Dan Tierney, said Monday.
Thus, Ohio will not be joining the Democrat-run states’ coalitions.
“You tend to hear about Ohio politicians wanting to do things the ‘Ohio way’ and not necessarily joining and superseding and watering down the power of Ohioans by putting this authority into a multi-state conglomerate,” Tierney added.
Science shouldn’t be a partisan issue, Liston said.
“We all want kids to be healthy; we all want us to use the best evidence in society to have better health outcomes,” Liston said. “I think it’s unfortunate that there’s been division and mistrust.”

But since that decrease was recorded in mid-2024, more people have signed up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, in 18 states and the District of Columbia. In those places, more people were using food stamps in May 2025 than in May 2024, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Nationally, the number of people on food stamps decreased slightly, by about 11,000 people, according to the preliminary data.
The broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed in July will cut federal funding for SNAP and tighten eligibility requirements, but most of those changes won’t take effect until next year.










People’s resources are going to be strained in many ways in the years to come.


– Joseph Llobrera, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 


The largest increase in food stamp use was in North Dakota, where the number of recipients increased by 14% to about 57,000. In Texas the increase was 10%, followed by 7% in Kentucky and 5% in both Hawaii and Colorado.
New Mexico had the highest percentage of people receiving SNAP, about 21%. The lowest participation rates were in New Hampshire, Utah and Wyoming, all with about 5% of their populations on food stamps, according to the analysis.
The number of food stamp users fell by almost 17% in Alaska, which is struggling with a backlog of applications. The states with the next largest declines were Connecticut (8%), Wyoming (7%) Maine (6%) and Mississippi (5%).

The decrease in the national poverty rate, from 11% in 2023 to 10.6% last year, could be short-lived, said Joseph Llobrera, director of research for food assistance at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Llobrera predicted that looming federal cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, also part of Trump’s domestic policy law, will increase the number of people who can’t afford food and other basic needs. “People’s resources are going to be strained in many ways in the years to come,” Llobrera said.
Louisiana had the highest poverty rate in 2024 (18.7%) followed by Mississippi (17.8%) and the District of Columbia (17.3%). The lowest rates were in New Hampshire (7.2%), Utah (8.3%), Vermont (9%), Maryland (9.1%) and New Jersey (9.2%)

(Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector) Every spring, I venture to Gove County in western Kansas to witness one last connection to our wild shortgrass prairie heritage: the mating dance of the lesser prairie chicken. As the executive director for Audubon of Kansas, we host an annual prairie chicken festival that attracts people from all over the world to see this iconic prairie grouse species.
Last month, a court ruling removed Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie chicken. This decision will send the birds flying toward extinction. The last time that such protections for the lesser prairie chicken were removed in 2016, extensive habitat loss occurred, with the great majority of these changes being related to energy extraction — oil and natural gas infrastructure or wind turbines.
When I sit in the blind this coming spring, I will mourn the fact that those alive today might be the last generations able to witness this timeless tradition if these protections are not reinstated.
I venture out hours before sunrise to sit in a blind in the dark waiting for the birds to appear. In the murky, first light of dawn, shapes appear with a flurry of wings, cackling calls and gobbling songs. Prairie chicken males vigorously defend their territory, on this same patch of ground, year after year.
As I watch, I am surrounded by relict bison wallows, reminding me that these birds were always linked to grazing — formerly bison and now cattle. Because more than 90% of the birds’ habitat is on private land, many of those who raise grass-fed cattle are allies for prairie chickens.
This is the second time that lesser prairie chickens have had their protections vacated.
Besides being bad for the prairie chicken, this on-again, off-again approach is bad for landowners willing to participate in voluntary conservation measures. Imagine being a landowner counting on funding for removing woody vegetation to increase forage available for cattle grazing, only to have it disappear overnight. Imagine working toward enrolling your property in a conservation easement to ensure that your family’s ranching operation will be profitable long term and available to the next generation, only to have your business plan toppled.
Prairie chickens and ranching can coexist, but this regulatory uncertainty is bad for business — both ranching and energy.

When lesser prairie chickens were most recently listed, two distinct population segments were defined and given different protections: the northern population in Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and northern Texas was classified as “threatened,” whereas the southern population in New Mexico and western Texas was classified as “endangered.” A lawsuit was advanced in 2023 by the state of Texas and the Permian Basin Petroleum Association against the U.S. Department of Interior in federal court.
The plaintiffs argued that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service improperly applied its policy for determining distinct population segments. Distinct population segments must be both discrete (physically separated) and also significant (different in genetics, habitat, or other factors).
When lesser prairie chickens were listed in 2022, the ruling document explicitly explained that two distinct population segments were justified because they were separated by 95 miles (discrete), and the two populations showed significant differences in habitat (oak-shinnery vs sage and bluestem) and genetic structure, and that the loss of one of the population segments would result in at least a 25 percent decline in habitat occupied (significant threat to area occupied).
However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service willfully neglected its own previous scientific finding in federal court.
The court ruling documents: “Following the change in federal administration in January 2025, Fish and Wildlife re-evaluated Plaintiff’s claims and now believe it erred in applying the distinct population segment policy and did not provide a sufficient justification that the two population segments of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken are significant for the purpose of identifying a distinct population segment.”
In other words, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service argues that there is enough evidence that the two populations are discrete, but not enough evidence that they were significant, despite ample evidence to the contrary.
For 30 years, various conservation measures have been enacted to bring back lesser prairie chickens. Yet, the birds have continued to decline. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service anticipates that it will make a new finding on the 2016 listing petition by Nov. 30, 2026.
So this loss of protection will hopefully be short-lived—and this time the protection should stick.
Endangered Species Act protections are a last-ditch effort to prevent extinction, and they have been successfully applied to save the vast majority of the species listed. Lesser prairie chickens need the protection of the ESA, and landowners need support to enact conservation measures that are good for the herd and good for the bird.

According to the Ohio Department of Health, about 1 in 7 Ohio five-year-olds entered Kindergarten this year unvaccinated. This is up from about 1 in 10 in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
One in ten is not a great baseline. According to the World Health Organization, that number needs to be closer to 1 in 20 for “herd immunity” to stop measles from spreading. This is certainly part of the reason Ohio has seen 35 measles cases this year.
The speed vaccination rates are falling in Ohio puts children at risk for even more diseases, though. If Ohio creeps closer to 1 in 5 children unvaccinated, children will approach the point where they are no longer herd immune to polio.
What can we do about this? 
Certainly we are living in an age of misinformation where trust in institutions like the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and even the Ohio Department of Health have declined. 
This has led to parents making decisions that the best medical science tells us is putting their children at risk for lifelong conditions or even death. 
Are there public policy solutions to this problem?

If policymakers are interested in improving vaccination rates and saving lives in the progress, they have options.
First, they can tighten nonmedical exemptions. 
A parent who leaves a gun unattended or a toddler next to a swimming pool in Ohio can be found negligent for endangering their child. 
A parent who refuses to put their child in a car seat or leaves their child in a hot car can be found negligent for endangering their child. 
But if a parent refuses to vaccinate their child, exposing them to life-threatening illnesses, they are protected by current Ohio law.
 Eliminating “reasons of conscience” that allow parents to opt out of vaccination requirements for whatever reason they see fit can help protect children and their peers. 
If policymakers are too squeamish to protect children in this way, they can instead help educate parents by requiring in-person vaccine education sessions, which has had some positive effect in helping parents make better decisions for their children in Michigan.
Second, the state can use its immunization information system to improve compliance with vaccination requirements. 
The state has a database that tracks immunizations across the state. The state can use this system to send auto-reminders like text messages, phone calls, or letters to families who are not up to date. 
The state can then publish schools that have low compliance rates by the Oct. 15 deadline so the public knows which schools are struggling to keep their children safe.
These are just two examples of what the state can do to increase immunization rates and protect children from lifechanging illnesses like measles and polio. 
Ohio has made so much progress in eradicating deadly diseases and immunization is a huge piece of the puzzle for how this has come to be. 
If policymakers can find ways to protect more children, they should do it.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)Nebraska and the federal Department of Homeland Security on Aug. 19 announced that the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook would be converted into a federal immigration detention facility, which Homeland Security branded the “Cornhusker Clink.”
About 186 people at the camp will be transferred to another facility within the state’s prison system, which has for years operated under an “overcrowding emergency.” Local leaders in McCook said they got only a half-hour briefing before the public rollout of the proposal. More than a dozen state lawmakers have since demanded a public hearing. More than 18,000 Nebraskans have signed a petition opposing the facility change.
The decision landed as the fall semester began. On the first day of class, I asked my law school students a simple question: What is prison for? Most answered rehabilitation, as if it were obvious. They imagined facilities with treatment programs, classes and job training designed so that the people inside return home better equipped than when they went in.
Nebraska’s own Department of Correctional Services has long called rehabilitation “at the heart” of public safety. The state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook was one of the few facilities built to reflect that goal. Its mission statement is clear: “Empowering people to do better.”
That makes the August announcement telling. Nebraska is turning a facility built for rehabilitation into a warehouse for federal detainees. Spaces once used for programming will be repurposed into detention units for up to 300 people — a number well over the building’s stated capacity — in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The state insists rehabilitation is central, yet when faced with a choice, leaders sidelined that goal in favor of a contract with Washington.
Supporters of the plan point to money and safety. Both arguments are shaky. Financially, typical immigration detention contracts pay a daily rate for each person in custody. Many also include so-called “bed quotas” that require ICE to pay for a set number of beds whether they are filled or not.
On paper, that may look like stability. In practice, it ties Nebraska’s budget to shifting and unstable federal enforcement priorities. When ICE changes direction or cancels a contract, communities are left with obligations and no revenue stream.
Other states have learned how risky that bargain can be. In Florida, a court halted further construction at the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, leaving the state’s taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars. Nebraska risks a similar mistake, trading rehabilitation for federal promises that can disappear overnight.
Even if the contract holds, communities carry the hidden costs of detention. Local health systems must respond to detainee needs. Ambulance crews make the runs and emergency rooms absorb the surges. In rural Nebraska, those systems are already stretched. More than half of the state’s rural hospitals operate at a loss. Community Hospital in McCook recently closed its clinic in nearby Curtis. Detention will not reverse that.
The safety rationale is equally weak. The people who will be held in McCook will not be serving criminal sentences. They will be immigration detainees facing civil proceedings, many with no convictions. Federal data show that most ICE detainees have no criminal record, and national research finds that immigrants are incarcerated for crimes at lower rates than U.S.-born Americans.
Adding detention beds in McCook will not reduce crime or improve public safety. What makes communities safer are the basics: staffed hospitals, strong schools and reliable infrastructure.
What this project offers is spectacle, not safety or stability. It is easier to announce a new detention hub with a catchy name than to confront the slow, difficult work of fixing overcrowded prisons, stabilizing rural hospitals and funding genuine reentry programs that actually keep communities safe.
This is not just Nebraska’s story. For decades, rural America was told prisons would bring prosperity. That promise rarely held. Now immigration detention is being sold as the replacement. The bargain is the same: dependence without security, spectacle without substance and the hollowing out of scarce rehabilitative capacity.
I do not tell my students that rehabilitation is the only purpose or function of prisons. But I do ask them to notice the gap between rhetoric and reality. Nebraska says rehabilitation matters. Yet when faced with a choice, the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds. That choice is not only about corrections policy. It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.
Back in my classroom, the lesson is clearer now. My students still say prisons are supposed to rehabilitate. Nebraska just taught them something else: that what counts is not second chances, but how many people can be locked up. If that is not the message we want the next generation of lawyers, policymakers and citizens to absorb, this is the moment to change course.

(Photo/Courtesy of William & Mary's Batten School & VIMS)Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature don’t think climate change is something we Floridians should be worrying about. But I guess nobody told the stone crabs.
Stone crabs — or rather, their tasty claws — have long been considered a South Florida seafood specialty. You see them served at places like the iconic Joe’s Stone Crab in Miami Beach. In fact, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says that Florida crabbers harvest 99% of all stone crab claws in the U.S. And the prices they charge ensure the crabbers are anything but crabby.
But now stone crabs are showing up as far north as Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.
Why? Because climate change has made conditions right for them to move.
“This is the first documented instance of stone crabs now being able to live inside of Chesapeake Bay,” marine biologist Romuald Lipcius told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel last week. “I believe, because of warming waters, that now, all of a sudden, stone crabs were able to survive, grow, and live for a long time inside of Chesapeake Bay.”
This is the latest sign of how our fossil fuel addiction is drastically altering our world. But our state and federal political “leaders” owe so much to their oil industry campaign contributors, they don’t want to hear about the consequences. 
Last year, the governor signed into law a bill that deleted the two C-words from most places where they occurred in state law. More recently, his “Department of Governmental Efficiency” has targeted local government programs focused on weaning people off fossil fuels in its search for “wasteful spending.”
Two years ago, our Ivy League-educated governor admitted that climate change is real. Yet now he seems far more concerned about the danger posed by rainbow crosswalks than the damage done by rapidly intensifying hurricanes or rising sea levels.
Meanwhile, the federal Department of Energy has released a report that insists any concern about our warming world is overblown. Eighty-five scientists condemned the report as “riddled with errors, misrepresentations and cherry-picked data to fit the president’s political agenda.”
While these people desperately attempt to silence the science, nature is repeatedly showing us that the truth can’t be ignored. It just keeps poking its head up and saying, “Yo! I’m still here! What are you going to do about it?”
Virginia is for crabs
If you’re not familiar with stone crabs, they got their name because, as the Fort Myers News Press once reported, “In the water, stone crabs look like stones, like muddy-gray river rocks indistinguishable from the rocks under which they burrow.”
Stone crabs’ powerful claws are so huge, they account for more than half of their total weight. They’re also specialized. One claw is for crushing, the other for tearing. To us humans, though, the meat from either one tastes delicious.

Crabbers carefully remove only one claw and toss the crab back so it can regrow the appendage. This is why stone crabs are considered a sustainable fishery. But it’s also a major reason why the claws cost so much — that, and the fact that the season for catching them lasts only from Oct. 15 to May 1.
In 1978, a Florida legislator tried to pass a law banning anyone from harvesting both claws. To show why this law was needed, he brought in a stone crab missing both claws and tossed it into a tank with a triggerfish.
The triggerfish, “over the gruesome course of an hour, attacked it, killed it and picked it clean,” the News Press noted. But the bill did not pass. Anglers know not to risk their livelihood by getting greedy and taking both claws.
Because I consider fresh seafood one of Florida’s greatest glories, I called up Lipcius to find out more about the Chesapeake stone crabs. Turns out, stone crab larvae have been repeatedly spotted in the Chesapeake for several years now. But they wouldn’t stick around long, he said.
“They can’t survive temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit,” he explained. “In Chesapeake Bay, the water temperature used to routinely drop below that in the winter.”
That’s not happening anymore, he said. The water has warmed too much. The crabbers are catching stone crabs that have survived three or four Virginia winters, he told me.
“I believe the stone crabs are here to stay,” he said. Scientists are now searching for signs that they’ve even begun breeding in the Chesapeake.
Because the crabbers finding them in their blue crab traps aren’t experienced at removing claws, he said, “for now we’re telling them, ‘Why don’t you toss them back?’” But soon, he predicted, local restaurants will start putting them on the menu.
Lipcius told me the stone crabs aren’t the only subtropical species to warm up to the warmer Chesapeake.
“We’ve never had a white shrimp fishery,” he said. “But now all of a sudden, they’re a common species here.”
He said one of the Chesapeake crabbers told him he’d caught three triggerfish. I guess it’s good that the stone crabs had both claws to fend off them off.
Virginia’s tourism slogan says that the state is for lovers. The way things are going, they may be able to add that it’s for lovers of Florida seafood.
Finding a unicorn
Lipcius called the Chesapeake stone crabs a rare instance of climate change creating a good-news story. I suppose it’s good news for folks in Virginia to have easier access to a type of seafood once considered exclusive to Florida.
But I wondered if it’s good news for Florida, where we’ve seen repeated marine heat waves that left us all in hot water.
Ryan Gandy via Sarasota Bay Estuary Program
To find out, I turned to Ryan Gandy, science and restoration manager for the Sarasota Bay Estuary Program. Before that, he spent 15 years as the FWC’s top stone crab expert.
Sure enough, Gandy told me the increased warmth of the waters off our coast has been causing problems for our own stone crabs and the crabbers catching them.
“They’re a biological indicator that the system is warming up,” Gandy said, referring to the trend.
The FWC has tried to protect stone crabs during the spawning season. But the spawning season has been changing because of the change in water temperature.
“We’re seeing [the spawning] begin earlier and earlier in the year,” Gandy said. “We used to close the season on May 15. Now it closes on May 1.”
Stone crabs are tough crustaceans, he said. A marine heat wave won’t kill them the way it does other species. But higher temperatures may hurt their prey.
“They feed on a lot of clams and mollusks like snails,” he said. Those species may be injured or killed by toxic algae blooms that have been known to accompany the heat waves, he told me.
Like Lipcius, Gandy also mentioned other species changing their habits and habitats because of climate change. The feisty snook, for instance.
“It used to be finding a snook in the Florida Panhandle was like finding a unicorn,” he said.  “Now it’s not unusual to find them near Pensacola.”
Snakes alive
There are plenty of other signs that nature’s being disrupted by the greenhouse gases spewing from our cars, trucks, boats, jets, and power plants.
As the world warms up, mangroves are sprouting in places they’ve never grown before. Our oceans have absorbed so much CO2, they’re becoming more acidic. Sea turtles, whose sex is determined by the temperature of the beach where they’re hatched, are turning out entire generations that are all female because it’s too hot to produce males.
Dave Zierden via FSU
I called up Dave Zierden, Florida’s official state climatologist — yes, we really do have one! — to ask him about this. He named several more examples. Invasive species, for instance.
Take those Burmese pythons we keep sending hunters out in the Everglades to track down. The snakes are slithering further and further north, showing up in West Palm Beach and Fort Myers. I keep waiting for one to claim a seat in the Florida Legislature, since that place tends to attract slimy characters.
Or look at what’s happening with green iguanas, which first wriggled their way into South Florida in 1965. Now the lizards that like to pop up in your toilet are showing up in Orange, Osceola, and Polk counties, too.
Both altered their range because of the changes we’ve made to the atmosphere, Zierden told me.
“More and more species of wildlife and plant life move further north as we get warmer temperatures,” he said.
Other pests are benefiting from our warmer weather, too — whiteflies, for instance, which attack Florida’s ornamental plant industry. Mosquitoes, which spread diseases such as dengue fever, are thriving thanks to the increased rain, longer summers, and milder winters.

Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright called concerns about climate change “silly.” Wright, the former CEO of a natural gas fracking company, is busy this week plugging gas and oil in Europe as if that’s who still employs him, not us taxpayers.
“Climate change, for impacting the quality of your life, is not incredibly important,” Wright said last week, according to The New York Times. “In fact, if it wasn’t in the news, in the media, you wouldn’t know.”
I guess nobody told him about our rapidly intensifying hurricanes.
They don’t care
Just this week, DeSantis’ newly appointed lieutenant governor, Jay Collins, was bragging about what a great job he and his boss were doing.
Jay Collins via his FB page
“Aren’t you glad to live in a state that values its people, that fights for the things that matter, and prioritizes the things that make a difference at your kitchen table, at your dinner table and for your family?” he said, according to Politico.
But they’re NOT doing that.
In fact, Collins was the Senate sponsor of the bill deleting most mentions of climate change from state law, a bill that DeSantis signed.
Every time DeSantis, Collins, and the rest turn their heads away from the dangers posed by climate change, they’re showing that they do not value Floridians and their lives at all.
They aren’t doing anything about our rising sea levels or the changes in our weather patterns, other than pretending it doesn’t exist. The insurance companies know that this is what’s driving our multiple disasters, but you won’t hear a peep about it out of our “leaders.”
They’ll eagerly tackle kooky stuff like “chemtrails” and “ending vaccine mandates.” But they’re hostile to anything backed up by actual science. Sometimes I think we should refer to the governor as “Denial-Santis.” He’d rather scoff than do anything constructive.
I have been pondering how we could turn the steering wheel on this demolition derby car away from the crash we can see coming. The solution may lie with the stone crabs.
I think we need to flood the governor’s mailbox with letters, emails, and phone calls complaining about how Virginia is stealing our native seafood. Why, those Virginians are just a bunch of crab-nappers! We need to claw back those delicious claws!
This will engage our governor’s overly developed sense of grievance. I’m sure he’ll immediately declare a state of emergency and order the stone crabs returned.
To get the crabs to stick around, we need to convince him to make sure they’re comfortable here — no more marine heat waves, plenty of prey, and so forth.
Unless someone else volunteers, I can be the one to tell him this. But I want a guarantee that I can get stone crab claws for free for the rest of my life. If you have to deal with a crabby politician, you should get rewarded with the claws.

The baby’s muscles were totally rigid so that it was impossible for him to lie flat. His jaw was clamped shut and when he attempted to cry, an eerie humming emanated from his clenched lips. It was an obvious case of tetanus.
I placed an intravenous line in the child to hydrate him and a nasogastric tube in his stomach to feed him. I gave him antibiotics, but the tetanus immunoglobulin was not available. The baby died.

Horrors like this were not uncommon in Haiti where there was little vaccination. I saw many patients maimed by polio. Children frequently died from measles.
Any reader interested in what happens when there is a lack of vaccines can read Chapter 9 from my book, The Neglected and Abused: A Physician’s Year in Haiti, by clicking this link. There is no charge.
No one in their right mind wants to see these tragedies reoccur in the United States. But it could happen as many supposed experts in public health have lost their credibility with many citizens. This culminated with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., firing numerous public health officials.
A major incident causing public distrust occurred in 1980 when the prestigious medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine, published a study that stated opioids were not addictive. This was pure idiocy. A drug company, Purdue Pharma, used this study to goad public health bureaucrats to ease up on the safeguards governing the prescription of these drugs. They then launched an army of opioid salespeople to seduce a class of greedy doctors to push these drugs on patients. The result, hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of addicts.
Ethically compromised judges looked the other way and allowed the owners of Purdue Pharma to keep much of their ill-gotten gains. This is chronicled in the book, Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty and the Netflix movie, Painkiller, for any reader who desires more information.
But the real damage was done by government policy during the COVID epidemic. While data showed that the vaccines were lifesaving in certain groups such as the elderly, the diabetic, the immunocompromised and the obese, the data supporting the COVID vaccine for children was dubious at best. But the vaccine was pushed on everybody. 
Plus, the fact that the CEO of Moderna, the manufacturer of the mRNA COVID vaccine, earned hundreds of millions during the pandemic heightened skepticism that this was just another corporate money grabbing scam.
Meanwhile a host of hurried and inconsistent rulings during the COVID epidemic allowed for contradictory and controversial outcomes, like closing some churches while allowing strip clubs to remain open.
In short, mixed messages from the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Anthony Fauci and others — all widely distributed and the subject of politically charged debate in both social media and mainstream outlets — resulted in mistrust and confusion in the minds of many as to the utility of all vaccines.
But the implications of this are devastating. Now many people who voted for Donald Trump believe that all vaccines are a scam. Florida’s Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has stated that vaccines in Florida should be voluntary. (Obviously, Ladapo has never been to Haiti.) Technically, this policy does not apply to measles, polio and tetanus vaccines, but it is unlikely that the average voter knows or understands this.


A reasonable compromise would be to review the latter recommendations for childhood vaccination. 
But public officials like Kennedy and Ladopa must take care in their actions and words. Vaccines have saved millions upon millions of lives and publicly challenging their efficacy could result in disastrous cases, such as the poor baby I tried to save in Haiti.

Today, most comedians deliberately weave the rude and crude negativity of sarcasm, cynicism, insults, criticism, swearing and sexual innuendo into the fabric of their skits. Yet not all comedy must include these things.

Gerry Williams
There is a growing movement across the United States and in Connecticut that’s broadly defined as “clean comedy.” It’s full of levity without being lewd. For example, I recently participated in the Uncompromised Comedy Conference in Atlanta. Comedians gathered for three days to inspire, encourage and equip each other to enlarge the professional presence of clean comedy in the performing arts of today and the future.
Here in Connecticut, my peers and I such as Rev. Dr. T.C. Brantley, Pastor of Restoration Springs Church in Waterbury; Savanda LaTrece, and others perform clean comedy. We perform at churches, banquets, festivals, fairs, parties, showers and such well-established organizations as the Central Connecticut Cooperative Farmers Association, Comix Roadhouse at Mohegan Sun, Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, Foxwoods Resort, Funny Bone Comedy Club, Knights of Columbus and Playhouse on Park in West Hartford. 
Some of the pioneering churches include Black Rock Church in Fairfield, Calvary Church in Southbury, Trinity United Methodist Church in Windsor and Victory Church in Middlebury. With over 3,000 faith-based organizations in Connecticut alone, think of the potential for clean comedy to permeate our state in a very grassroots way. How refreshing!
Based on our experience, crowd response is consistently positive. In some instances, parents even bring their teenage children for a fun night out! For venue owners, ticket and concession revenues are making clean comedy financially feasible.
For the pendulum to continue to swing away from lewd and toward levity, comedy show ticket-buyers, advertisers and sponsors must intentionally request that clean comedy acts be booked at their favorite local and area venues. I encourage you to make “clean” social media posts supportive of clean comedians. Email, text or mail “clean” messages to booking agents and venue managers. 
Perhaps the single best way to reach out is to simply pick up the phone and call these contacts person-to-person. Even a polite and passionate voicemail can encourage more clean comedy in your community. By all means, if you are active in an organization that creates events, suggest clean comedy for the entertainment. It’s funny how just a few advocates of clean comedy can make such a positive difference.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Maryland political leaders from both sides of the aisle were united Wednesday in their call for an end to political violence, after the fatal shooting of high-profile conservative political activist Charlie Kirk during an event at a Utah college campus.
“Today, Maryland, the country, and the world saw yet another act of heinous political violence on American soil,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a written statement Wednesday evening.
“Political violence is unacceptable. We will not tolerate it – not now, not ever,” his statement said. “In the wake of today’s events, we share a collective responsibility to condemn this tragedy in the strongest possible terms and be bold in our commitment to greater unity and peace.”
Moore ordered that flags on state facilities will be flown at half-staff, through sundown Sunday, mirroring an earlier order by President Donald Trump (R) who said U.S. flags would be flown at half-staff “as a mark of respect for the memory of Charlie Kirk.”
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

The shooting brought an outpouring of statements from Maryland political leaders throughout the afternoon Wednesday, echoing Moore’s remark, after news broke of the attack.
Maryland’s Senate Republicans joined in a written statement, praising Kirk and calling for a rejection of political violence.
“The killing of Charlie Kirk is a shocking and tragic act of violence. He was a husband, a father and a national voice who chose to engage in spirited debate and conversation on collage campuses,” the statement said. “There is never any justification for political violence.”
Kirk was appearing Wednesday afternoon at an event at Utah Valley University sponsored by Turning Point USA, the youth-oriented political organization he founded and ran. At similar campus events, he would take questions from students and debate the on various political topics.
Kirk was in the middle of responding to a question on gang violence and mass shootings around 12:20 p.m. when he appeared to be struck by a single shot, according to reports. Videos of the attack and students fleeing the campus quickly circulated online.
Kirk was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival, according to news reports. Trump announced the death on Truth Social at 4:40 p.m.
It’s yet another high-profile shooting of a political figure in a little more than a year dating back to  July 2024, when Trump narrowly avoided an assassination attempt while on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania.
In June of this year, Minnesota House Speaker Rep. Melissa Hortman (D) and her husband were shot and killed at their home in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) called a “politically motivated attack.” Just hours earlier, Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman (D) and his wife were shot in their home, but survived. The same man is suspected in both shootings.
Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said in a social media post Wednesday that, just as he “tragically” prayed for the Hortman family after the Minnesota shooting, “I now pray for the Kirk family who is facing the unimaginable.”
What Melissa Hortman means to Maryland

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) lamented a school shooting in Colorado that also occurred midday Wednesday as the news primarily followed Kirk’s attack.
“First the shooting of Charlie Kirk, and then the shooting at Evergreen High School,” Scott said on social media. “This senseless violence has no place in our country, whether politically motivated or otherwise. No one should ever have to live in fear in our classrooms, schools or places of worship.”
Maryland’s lone Republican in Congress, U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), called Kirk an “American patriot” and wished his family well during “this time of imaginable loss.”
Sympathy for Kirk and his family, as well as bipartisan condemnation of political violence, began as soon as news of his shooting was out, even before Kirk’s death was confirmed.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) and House Minority Whip Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick) said in a joint statement that “we cannot hate our way to a better America.”
“We cannot commit horrific acts of wanton violence against those who may strongly disagree with us about matters of public policy,” their statement said. “That is not democracy. It is not American. We must make sure that every citizen of this nation, of all political persuasions, understands that violence in pursuit of silencing debate is never the answer and that no one should countenance these disgusting actions.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (MD-D) agreed, posting that “violence is never the answer” when he learned Kirk was shot. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called the attack “horrific and senseless.”
“There can be absolutely no place for political violence in America,” Hogan said in a social media post.
Maryland U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) took to social media to condemn “another absolutely disgraceful act of gun violence” and offered thoughts and prayers for Kirk’s family prior to his death.
“We must categorically reject all violence in our society,” Raskin’s statement said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_Kirk-Shooting_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 23:56:17.044270

Nine organizations across Delaware will receive a combined $173,000 through the Tree for Every Delawarean Initiative (TEDI), supporting the planting of 12,055 trees in the spring of 2026.
TEDI is a statewide effort led by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and the Department of Agriculture’s Delaware Forest Service, intending to plant one million trees by 2030.
 Since the initiative began, more than 350,000 trees have already been planted with the help of partners and a range of funding sources.
RELATED STORY: ASMFC to hold public hearing on proposed striped bass management plan
“TEDI has a goal of a million trees for Delaware’s million residents because of everything they do for us,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson. “From an environmental perspective, trees pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which means they combat climate change. Trees in urban areas provide shade, reducing the heat island effect and lowering energy costs.”
Funding Recipients
The following groups will receive support for tree planting projects:

Delaware Nature Society (Hockessin)

Mount Cuba Center (Hockessin)

Delaware Wild Lands, Inc. (Odessa)

Delaware Center for the Inland Bays (Rehoboth Beach)

Skyline Middle School (Red Clay Consolidated School District)

West Park Place Elementary School (Christina School District)

Friends of Bellevue State Park (Wilmington)

University of Delaware (Newark)

Village of Ardentown (New Castle County)


Robert “Blake” Moore of the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension said the funding will help move forward the Kranz Farm food forest tree project.
“That project will support a variety of wildlife, as well as provide water quality and climate carbon sequestration and storage benefits,” he said.
Fall Tree Giveaways
In addition to funding the planting projects, TEDI will host nine tree giveaway events this fall, distributing 2,250 trees directly to residents across all three counties. Event dates and locations are listed at de.gov/tedi and DNREC’s Calendar of Events, and include:

Sept. 20: University of Delaware Cooperative Extension (Milford)

Sept. 26: New Castle County (Glasgow Regional Park)

Oct. 3: New Castle County (Rockwood Park)

Oct. 11: Delaware Botanic Gardens (Dagsboro)

DOVER – The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) will host a hybrid public hearing on Thursday, Sept. 18, from 6 to 8 p.m., to gather public input on Draft Addendum III to Amendment 7 of the Atlantic Striped Bass Interstate Fishery Management Plan.
The hearing will take place in person at the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control’s Little Creek Hunter Education Center Training Center, or participants can attend virtually.
The proposed action is designed to increase the likelihood of rebuilding striped bass stock to target levels by 2029. To reach that goal, the plan calls for reducing fishery removals by 12% beginning in 2026.
RELATED STORY: Dam removal project restores natural flow for fish in Brandywine River
For the commercial sector, the draft addendum proposes a quota reduction. For the recreational fishery, options under consideration include season closures and changes to size limits. In Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay recreational fishery, the plan proposes adjusting the baseline season to simplify regulations, improve compliance and enforcement, and better align fishing access with mortality rates of released striped bass.
Current rules allow states to decide whether to tag commercially harvested striped bass at the point of harvest or at the point of sale. The draft addendum raises concerns that tagging at the point of sale could increase the risk of illegal harvest. To address this, the plan considers requiring tagging either at the point of harvest or at the first point of landing to strengthen enforcement and compliance.
RELATED STORY: 2 invasive fish break state records in Delaware waters
The addendum also highlights concerns over inconsistent methods used to measure the total length of striped bass for compliance with size limits. These variations can undermine conservation efforts and enforcement. To create uniformity, the proposal considers establishing coastwide requirements for defining total length across both commercial and recreational sectors.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/striped-bass-e1757268123595.jpg,,,2025-09-10 22:56:55.456840

Mike Shower will run for lieutenant governor alongside Republican gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson, the two announced Tuesday night in Big Lake.
Wilson is the first of Alaska’s 10 governor candidates to announce her running mate.
The other nine candidates include former Democratic Sen. Tom Begich of Anchorage and eight Republicans: former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; and Bruce Walden of Palmer. Former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor is also expected to file for the office.
Current Rep. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, said he will run for Shower’s seat in the state Senate. Rauscher previously ran for Senate in 2018 and said he put his name in “one minute after Bernadette stated it was Shower.”
By phone, Wilson said the lieutenant governor has two jobs: taking care of the state seal, and taking care of elections. 
“The Division of Elections is incredibly important and too important to get passed off to who is the politically expedient candidate,” she said.

Bernadette Wilson and Mike Shower pose for a photo on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025, in Big Lake, Alaska. (Bernadette Wilson photo)

Wilson said she believes “election integrity and the ability to vote at the ballot box is the very foundation of the Republic” and said that Shower is the right person to fix problems with voting in rural Alaska, an unusually large voter roll, and slow-to-arrive results.
“I felt very confident that Sen. Mike Shower has the knowledge in that area. It is an area that he is passionate about, which is the first step in solving any problem, and he’s worked on that extensively. So I felt that that was incredibly important and made him the best choice for Alaska’s next lieutenant governor,” she said.
Shower served over 20 years as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and currently works as a commercial cargo pilot. 
Shower was originally appointed to the Senate in February 2018 to replace Mike Dunleavy, who held the seat until resigning to run for governor. Elected on his own merits later that year and re-elected in 2022, he has repeatedly introduced proposals to make changes to the state’s elections system.
His first proposal was introduced in 2019 related to election security protocols, before President Donald Trump began lying about fraud in the 2020 election. 
Currently the Senate’s minority leader, he has regularly re-introduced legislation related to the state’s elections system and has frequently been a key figure in end-of-session negotiations on the topic. Thus far, the Legislature has been unable to pass significant changes.
As a member of the Senate, Shower has consistently endorsed the idea of a large Permanent Fund dividend, going so far as to propose a statewide tax in order to pay for it. 
Wilson said that she and Shower are confident in their ability to win the governor’s race, but if they finish behind another Republican in the August primary, they will withdraw and throw their support behind the leading Republican.
Under Alaska’s current voting system, all candidates for the same office run in the same race, regardless of political party. The top four-vote getters advance to the general election, where Alaskans use ranked choice voting to pick the ultimate winner.
Wilson, one of the leaders of a campaign to repeal that system, said she believes “that when you’ve got multiple people on the ballot of any party, it leads to so much confusion, it leads to voters only ranking one at the end of the day. … I think it’s very arrogant to say, Well, I’m not the top vote getter, but I’m going to stay in anyways. I just don’t think that that’s appropriate.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Japan’s largest electric company has agreed to buy 1 million tons of natural gas per year from the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, developer Glenfarne announced Wednesday.
A final decision on whether to build the pipeline for in-state use is expected by the end of the year. 
Company officials say that by the end of 2026, they will decide whether to build the pipeline’s export components, which would be needed to fulfill the new deal.
Under a deal finalized in March, Glenfarne owns 75% of the AKLNG project, as the gas effort is known, with the remaining 25% owned by the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a state-owned corporation.
Financing the multibillion-dollar project is a major hurdle, and export agreements like the one signed Wednesday with the Japanese utility JERA, which produces one-third of Japan’s electricity, could decide whether banks are willing to loan money for the pipeline’s construction.
Glenfarne has previously announced agreements with Taiwan’s CPC and Thailand’s PTT, both state-owned energy companies. 
When all three agreements are combined, they amount to 9 million tons of the expected 20 million-ton pipeline capacity. Glenfarne itself may take another share, approximately 2 million tons per year, though that share could be replaced by other third-party agreements.
As a result, Glenfarne now has “preliminary commercial agreements for more than half of Alaska LNG’s available third-party LNG offtake capacity,” it said in a statement.
Since the start of his second term in office, President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his support for the project. Rex Cannon, co-president of the subsidiary 8 Star Alaska, in charge of developing the pipeline project, said last month that the U.S. Department of Energy could provide federal loans for the effort.
A recently negotiated trade deal between Japan and the United States could have the government of Japan invest in the project as well, but that idea remains unconfirmed.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed in a TV interview last week that Japan would be required under the broader trade deal to direct $550 billion toward projects in the United States. He suggested the Alaska gas pipeline as an example.
Japanese officials have not confirmed Lutnick’s perspective, and reports out of Japan have been skeptical.
The Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, resigned on Sunday, and it was not immediately clear whether that would affect trade negotiations.
This week, the news service Reuters reported that Japan has hired energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie to assess the feasibility of the pipeline project. Wood Mackenzie worked for the state on previous iterations of the project.
South Korea, another major potential buyer of Alaska gas, has not yet announced whether it will or will not buy gas from the pipeline or otherwise participate.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250828-Rex-Cannon-slide-1024x853.jpg,,,2025-09-10 21:57:26.074460

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) HARWOOD, N.D. — The Harwood City Council gave final approval for a data center Wednesday but the city of Fargo plans to continue to pursue adding the site to its city limits. 
Harwood called a special meeting Wednesday to approve rezoning 320 acres from agricultural to light industrial so Texas-based Applied Digital can build a $3 billion facility where tech companies can house computers for creating artificial intelligence. 
Harwood’s City Hall was filled to capacity for the meeting, with some project opponents pressing signs against the windows for council members to see. Many of the signs urged the council and Mayor Blake Hankey to allow public comment.

Hankey, who led the meeting remotely, asked council members if they wanted to take public comments but none did. 
The Applied Digital building site is southeast of Harwood, outside the city limits, at the edge of its extraterritorial area. The property is adjacent to Fargo’s extraterritorial area. 
Jim Gilmour, director of strategic planning and research for the city of Fargo, said in an interview before the meeting that Fargo is better suited to develop the infrastructure, such as roads and sewer lines, that the project will need. 
“We’re in a better position as a city of 135,000 to kind of work with that growth versus a city of a few hundred,” Gilmour said. 
Gilmour said Fargo will be mailing annexation notices to property owners, the city of Harwood, Cass County and townships of its proposal to annex three areas between Fargo and Harwood, including the Applied Digital site. 
He said the Fargo City Commission will meet Nov. 10 to review any protests and make a decision on whether to push forward. 
If Fargo does try for annexation, Gilmour said it may be up to an administrative law judge to decide if the area belongs to Harwood or Fargo. 
On the line is tax dollars each year that Applied Digital would pay that could support local services. 
Harwood contends it would have to give Fargo permission to annex the property. At a Sept. 2 meeting, the Harwood City Council voted against giving Fargo that permission. 
At the meeting, Applied Digital Executive Vice President Nick Phillips said the company would side with Harwood if jurisdiction were to come down to a legal battle. 
Gilmour said the extraterritorial areas were established in a 1998 agreement between Harwood and Fargo, but that agreement expired after 10 years. 
“So there really is no agreement between the two cities right now for who should have what territory,” Gilmour said. 
Wednesday’s special meeting of the Harwood City Council was called to give a second and final reading to approving the zoning change and building permit that Applied Digital needs to break ground. 
Company announces plan for $3 billion data center north of Fargo

The initial votes came Sept. 2 after contentious public hearings. Applied Digital has tried to assure area residents that the data center won’t drive up utility rates or use large amounts of water. 
The company may break ground yet this month. Keith Leier, senior construction manager for Applied Digital, said the company wanted to work out some traffic flow details before moving dirt at the site. 
The first part of the facility that it calls Polaris Forge 2 is planned to be operational in the second half of 2026 and phase two operational in 2027.
Applied Digital said the data center will have 200 to 300 employees in addition to numerous contractors. 
The company also has sites in Jamestown and Ellendale. 
Dale Rosenkranz, a 20-year Harwood resident, was among those who called for the council to take public comments. 
He said the four-member council was “hiding behind their authority.”  He said the approval process felt rushed since Applied Digital made its plans public on Aug. 18. 
Rosenkranz said Harwood, a town of about 800 people,  would lose the “small, comfortable” feel that attracted many residents. 
“The town is going to change,” he said.

(Photo courtesy Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)In recent days, residents of Virginia and other states began to need a prescription from their primary care provider in order to get a COVID vaccine, a change prompted by shifting federal requirements. An order the Virginia Department of Health issued Wednesday now makes it easier for eligible Virginians to get vaccines in the weeks ahead.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently ended broad emergency authorizations for COVID vaccines that have been in place since vaccines first rolled out for the global pandemic. Under that new federal rule, health care providers and pharmacists could no longer freely offer COVID shots to the public. The new standing order allows Virginians 18 and older to still receive vaccines, sans prescription.
The new federal requirements to be 64 and older or have a prescription had posed challenges for people statewide, according to health care workers and advocates.
 “While one barrier might not seem like a big deal for one population, it is for others,” University of Virginia nursing professor Ashley Apple recently told The Mercury. 
Those who live in rural areas or areas with fewer hospitals or primary care clinics may have a harder time accessing a primary care provider and obtaining a prescription. That’s about 3.8 million Virginians statewide, according to a recent Virginia Commonwealth University study. 
Last week, two primary care clinics and an urgent care clinic closed that serve patients in the Shenandoah Valley. Augusta Health, which had operated those clinics, cited federal actions like forthcoming health care changes in the reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer as a contributing factor. But the closures still mean less of their health care footprint in the region, and hurdles for some of their patients. 
Before VDH’s order, Apple had anticipated a “bottleneck” at primary care clinics, as both current patients and new ones seeking to establish a primary care provider would rush to schedule appointments for prescriptions. She had also suggested the health department issue such an order to quickly open access to the vaccine. The Mercury had asked VDH Tuesday if this type of order was a possibility; VDH epidemiology spokesman Logan Anderson said he wasn’t yet able to answer the question. 
While the order can alleviate some of the current hiccup amid the shifting federal policies, accessibility to COVID-19 shots are still up in the air pending other federal actions. 
On Sep. 18, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet to discuss guidance for doctors, insurance companies and states on how shots can be accessed. 
Insurance companies typically cover vaccines that are recommended by the CDC, but that could change depending on what the ACIP meeting entails. 
For people with insurance, their shots might be covered or partially-covered. Out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus vaccines can range in hundreds of dollars. CVS, for instance, charges $224.99. 
While ACIP plans to deliberate the future landscape of vaccines, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed critics of coronavirus vaccines to the committee, which could signal that the shots may be less accessible, more broadly. 
In the meantime, VDH’s order can help those wishing to get their vaccines in the near future. The nation is no longer experiencing a global pandemic, and vaccines have played a role in reducing infections. Last week, nearly 4,000 Virginians tested positive for COVID-19. As colder months approach and people are more likely to gather inside, airborne spread illnesses typically experience upticks.

September is the final month of the federal budget year, and typically, the training held at armories across Washington on the second weekend draws a large turnout. 
But due to a budget shortfall, adjustments were made to pare participation and reduce costs.
Approximately 5,000 soldiers were scheduled to drill for the full weekend. An estimated half received an excused absence while the other half participated for a portion but not the entire period, officials said. Those with training requirements drilled and any soldier who desired to participate could, officials said. 
“The work that needed to be accomplished, got accomplished,” said Joseph Siemandel, state public affairs officer for the Washington National Guard.
Exactly how many did not take part and how much money was saved will be known in a few weeks. A typical drill weekend costs about $2.5 million, officials said. Participants earn between a couple hundred dollars to as much as $1,000 a weekend, based on their rank and number of service years.
There are a variety of reasons for the budget shortfall, said Karina Shagren, communications director for the Washington Military Department. 
One of those was the decision by the National Guard bureau to pull back funding for training from several states, including $3 million from Washington since February, “with the expectation that Congress would allocate funding to fill the hole left behind,” she said. 
“That expected funding has yet to arrive — and the money taken has been redirected to support other missions — to include domestic deployments,” she said.
Shagren did not know if funds shifted away from Washington went to underwrite costs associated with the deployment in the District of Columbia, or elsewhere such as the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles.
Last month, President Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops to patrol the streets of the nation’s capital. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth followed that with a directive that they be allowed to carry weapons.
Trump has since signed an executive order directing state National Guard units to be ready to assist local, state and federal law enforcement. He’s threatened to use them in Chicago. More recently, he vowed to “clean up” Portland and “wipe out” protesters in Oregon’s largest city, propelling state officials into action to prevent such a move.
Trump has yet to set his sights on Seattle. 
Shagren said losing the dollars and excusing those soldiers from the most recent training has not weakened the capabilities of the state’s National Guard.
“On drill weekends, we focus on getting our men and women ready for all kinds of missions. So when those training opportunities get cut back, it clearly affects our overall readiness. That said, we’re still fully capable of responding to emergencies both here at home or abroad,” Shagren said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguardthree_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 20:56:43.985866

After wildlife advocates and retired biologists came out in force, the commission unanimously rejected an agency recommendation to remove Red Desert and Farson region from protected corridor.
The post Game and Fish Commission reverses plan to trim Wyoming’s first pronghorn migration corridor appeared first on WyoFile .","After a four-hour discussion about nixing protections for two portions of a famous pronghorn migration that weaves across the Green River Basin, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission reversed course to formally designate the route in its entirety. 
“With 20 years of science, data and the vast support of the public, I believe this should move forward to the next stage,” Commissioner Ken Roberts, who made the motion, said at Wednesday’s meeting in Lander. 
In the moment, the court clerk from Kemmerer didn’t say much about why he wasn’t going with Game and Fish’s recommendation to not designate two of the 10 segments of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration. That had come much earlier. Roberts jumped in to share his doubts shortly after the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s Jill Randall and Martin Hicks presented their agency’s proposal.
“I can’t see where it hurts anybody,” Roberts said of leaving the migration intact. “I’m just kind of mystified.”

Hicks, the state’s deputy chief of wildlife, reasoned the threats to pronghorn moving through the Red Desert and “East of Farson” segments didn’t rise to a level that warranted protection under Wyoming’s policy, which is being taken for its first spin nearly six years after it was revamped in response to industry concerns. 
“There’s no bottlenecks, and the threat levels were limited — that, to us, precluded designation,” Hicks said. 
He also explained there was a lack of “high-use” habitat in the two segments. That’s the designation for areas used by greater than 20% of collared pronghorn. 
But there was another unspoken factor at play that partly explained why Roberts was skeptical and why most seats were filled for hours at the Lander Community and Convention Center.
The Wyoming Stock Growers Association’s lobbyist, Jim Magagna, renowned for his influence in Wyoming politics, has a ranch in the vicinity, and he’d asked that the two segments be removed, while also noting that maintaining his land and grazing lease locations had nothing to do with the request.

On Wednesday, Maganga told commissioners his concern with including the two segments had to do with the sheer size of the migration corridor — at 2.6 million acres, it’s larger than Yellowstone National Park. 
“That’s going to build opposition to the whole concept of the executive order,” Magagna said. “It’s the lumping of everything together, that is our major concern.” 
There were other concerns aired as well. Oil and gas industry representatives shared doubts about the need to advance a new layer of habitat protection for a migration path that cuts across the Pinedale Anticline, Jonah and Normally Pressured Lance gas fields. Steve Degenfelder, a Casper-based landman for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, told the governor-appointed commission that the Anticline alone had generated $2.75 billion in education funding.

“Twelve-thousand, eight hundred and sixty-five Wyoming students had their entire K-12 education made by one project,” he said. 
Repeatedly through the morning, commissioner John Masterson asked commenters for input on how the Game and Fish Commission should balance its mission — “conserving wildlife and serving people” — with “perfectly legitimate” social and political considerations. The question was posed to Degenfelder, too.
“Your initiative should be towards wildlife,” Degenfelder said. 
The sentiment was a theme of almost all the other public comments. Retired biologists, recreational hunters and bunches of professional conservationists had a unified message in urging the seven-person commission to designate all 10 segments of the Sublette Pronghorn Migration. It’s among the largest and the best studied pronghorn populations in the world, and Brock Wahl of the North American Pronghorn Foundation worried about the repercussions of inaction or getting the designation wrong.
“If we can’t get it right in this particular instance,” he told commissioners, “I feel as if it sets a very bad precedent for anything going forward.”

Meghan Riley of the Wyoming Outdoor Council emphasized the sheer number of pronghorn migrating through the segments at risk of being axed. There are about 5,000, she said, far more than traverse the famous Path of the Pronghorn and punch through all the way to Jackson Hole. 
“It would be a mistake to discount the significance of this segment to the population as a whole,” Riley said. “Accessing summer range matters to animals’ survival just the same, whether that animal travels 165 miles or 30 miles.” 
Todd Guenther, a Lander archaeologist, joined the chorus in calling for the commission to designate the entire migration. Pronghorn are “fragile,” he said, and in need of “proactive” care. 
“Too many times over my life, since I was a kid, wildlife [has] become a sacrificial lamb for different types of development projects,” Guenther said. “We’re running out of opportunities to preserve these different forms of wildlife.”

Because of housing sprawl and industrial development, Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migrations are at “high risk” of being lost, according to an earlier Game and Fish analysis. In a later phase of the years-long process, the public came out in strong support of taking action and deploying Wyoming’s migration policy for the first time. Nearly 99% of the 530 comments the state agency received asked for designation, according to data Randall, with Game and Fish, presented in the meeting. 
Game and Fish Commissioner Rusty Bell, of Gilllette, cited the volume of public support as he explained why he was supporting Roberts’ motion to designate all 10 migratory segments used by the Sublette Pronghorn Herd. 
“I think people want to see designation,” Bell said. “I’m going to go along with what the people have said.” 
Unanimously, the other six commissioners made the same call. The Game and Fish Commission’s decision to buck its department’s proposal was “not unexpected,” Magagna told WyoFile after the vote. 
“I respect their decision,” he said. “We’ll go along to the next step and be engaged there.”
Next up in Wyoming’s labyrinthine designation process, Game and Fish’s migration proposal will go to Gov. Mark Gordon. If the governor finds it favorable, he’ll then appoint an “area working group” to review the migration. That will include representatives for each county that the corridor cuts through and a number of stakeholders — at least two will represent agriculture.

Judy Ward","A pharmacy manager retrieves a bottle of antibiotics. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of state senators heard from pharmacy owners about the impacts of pharmacy benefit manager reforms and what can still be done to stop pharmacies across the commonwealth from closing.
”It’s very telling to me that we have a caucus here of folks from rural and urban areas, Republican and Democrat, and we’re coming to you in desperation,” said Sen. Judy Ward (R-Blair), Republican chair of the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus.
One of the pharmacists sharing her experiences was Chichi Momah, the CEO and founder of Springfield Pharmacy in Delaware County.
Aside from filling prescriptions and administering vaccines, Momah’s business does tests for diseases like RSV and strep, provides special packaging for patients with memory issues, makes house calls to disabled patients, and regularly advises patients on a host of health issues — services that are especially important since the closure of nearby Crozer Medical Center and Taylor Hospital.
“Our work is hands-on. It’s constant and it is deeply personal,” Momah said.
Yet Momah said her pharmacy is struggling, and she’s often shifting funds around to keep all the pieces of her business afloat.
“We are exhausted,” she said. “We’re stretched thin and doing everything possible to serve patients with the very little resources we have.”
And the experience is not entirely unique.
According to the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus’ Democratic chair, Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton), around 600 pharmacies in Pennsylvania — often on the front lines of community health care — have closed in the last two years. Pharmacy owners and trade groups lay the blame largely on pharmaceutical industry middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
Pa. pharmacists demand state action to regulate PBMs, curb pharmacy closures

PBMs are companies hired by insurance providers to handle the prescription side of health insurance plans. When an insured patient picks up a script, paying only a co-pay if anything, it’s the PBM that reimburses the pharmacist on behalf of their insurance plan.
But the companies have come under scrutiny from both state lawmakers and federal regulators. Critics say they’ve contributed to the rising cost of drugs and driven down pharmacy’s bottom lines, leading to a wave of closures around the country.
One of the primary issues raised by pharmacists is the slowly dwindling reimbursement rates they receive for drugs they dispensed to covered patients. In some cases, what they receive from PBMs fails to cover the cost of stocking and dispensing the prescription.
The three largest PBMs in the country, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx, are estimated to represent roughly 80% of all health care plans. Pharmacists say that leaves them stuck with the option of accepting the reimbursement rates they offer or potentially losing all customers covered by them.

Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing many of the nation’s largest PBMs, said, “PBMs recognize that pharmacies are critical to providing patients access to get their prescriptions. That’s why PBMs are supporting community pharmacies in Pennsylvania through programs that increase payments for dispensing drugs.”
Last year, Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a law to rein in PBMs and give state regulators tools to block certain practices community pharmacists said were driving them out of business. But on Wednesday, pharmacists said the measures weren’t enough to stop their stores from closing.
“Act 77 is limited in scope,” said Victoria Elliott, CEO of the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association, a trade group representing independent and small chain pharmacies across the state. “If that were expanded, we might not be having this conversation.” 
While the law banned certain practices criticized as anti-competitive — such as PBMs funneling patients toward preferred pharmacies that are often owned by the same parent company — it did not require the middlemen to reimburse pharmacies at higher rates.
According to state Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys, while he expects the law to help struggling pharmacies, he said it only applies to PBMs contracted for commercial healthcare plans written in Pennsylvania. That’s roughly a quarter of plans in the commonwealth.
And some parts of the law have yet to kick in.
“We realized the delayed effect dates for Act 77 have caused confusion and frustration as Pennsylvania community pharmacies are struggling and in need of assistance,” Humphreys said.

But the hearing focused primarily on the role of prescriptions filled through Medicaid, a health insurance program run by the state, which accounts for around 11% of all prescriptions in the commonwealth.
Federal law makes it difficult to regulate many commercial health insurance plans on the state level. But lawmakers and administration officials could theoretically take action to change the practices of PBMs hired to administer prescription benefits through Medicaid.
The state Department of Human Services hires managed care organizations (MCOs) to administer Medicaid benefits. Those companies in turn hire PBMs to handle prescription benefits and reimburse pharmacies.
When a PBM reimburses a pharmacy for a prescription picked up by a Medicaid patient, pharmacists receive a sum based on both the cost of the drug itself and a dispensing fee intended to cover the costs like bottles and printed labels.
But pharmacists told lawmakers that, in some cases, the dispensing fees are as low as $1 or $3, causing particular strain for pharmacies in areas with high rates of Medicaid enrollment. 
In some cases, reimbursement rates don’t cover what the pharmacy paid for the drug. Deron Schultz, CEO of Minnich’s Pharmacy in York, said that he regularly loses money dispensing Biktarvy, a brand name HIV medication that he called a matter of “life or death” for his patients. He also listed other, more common drugs like certain blood pressure and cholesterol medications, depending on the PBM reimbursing him.

Pharmacy trade groups believe the low reimbursement rates violate at least the spirit of the contract that Medicaid MCOs sign with the state’s Department of Human Services. That contract states pharmacy reimbursements must accurately reflect the cost of a drug and “the pharmacist’s professional services and cost to dispense the prescription.”
Val Arkoosh, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, testified her agency is unable to see whether or not a pharmacy profits when it dispenses drugs to Medicaid patients, but does know how much the managed care organization and PBM pay them and their rationale for doing so. 
Moreover, Arkoosh stressed that her department created a grievance process for pharmacists if they believe they’re being treated unfairly by PBM’s contracted with MCOs providing Medicaid services.
“[The Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association] had the opportunity to review the draft agreement language,” Arkoosh said. “DHS received comments and several changes were incorporated into the agreement based on those.”
Lawmakers also asked panelists about the possibility of moving Pennsylvania’s Medicaid plans to what’s called a “single PBM” system. 
That’s what states like Ohio and Kentucky did when facing similar issues.
Instead of allowing MCOs to hire PBMs to handle prescription benefits, those states now hire a single PBM to act more as an administrator across their Medicaid plans. That’s allowed those states to set terms like reimbursement rates for pharmacies to ensure they aren’t losing money dispensing prescriptions.
According to reports, the move has not only helped pharmacies in those states, but saved taxpayers’ millions of dollars.
Arkoosh, however, urged some caution in using those reports as an indication of what could happen if Pennsylvania did the same. She said because the commonwealth has regulated the middlemen in ways those states hadn’t when they switched to a single PBM model for Medicaid, it’s unlikely the state would see the same level of savings.
However, she said there may still be merit and that DHS is looking into the possibility.
“That may be the right policy decision for a whole host of other reasons, but I’m not sure it’s going to save the commonwealth money,” she said. “We are deep in that analysis”
Testifying pharmacists, meanwhile, also brought up the possibility of requiring PBMs administering Medicaid plans to pay a minimum dispensing fee of around $10 for every prescription filled, on top of a reimbursement for the cost of the drug itself.
Ultimately, lawmakers said they will continue to look at the issues.
“This is an issue that we’re really going to stay focused on,” Ward said. “We will continue to have these meetings.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway officials told lawmakers they would “dig in” to solve utility easement concerns raised by leaders of multiple cities and organizations — but also defended its “good outcomes” and said the easement process is complicated.
Those problems, raised at an earlier meeting of the Legislature’s Energy and Technology Interim Committee, include high fees for permits and a lack of consistent communication from the company on active projects.
City officials from four different Montana towns have brought issues to the Legislature.
Several BNSF employees spoke to the committee on Tuesday. The issue of easements, which also touches the state’s efforts to increase rural broadband, came to a public head earlier this summer during another ETIC meeting.
BNSF defended its process, saying how to grant easements, and running cables near tracks, is complicated because it needs to be safe and pointed to examples of where they’ve had successful partnerships. Consistency with the permit process, including communication and how much the utility permits will cost, has been the crux of the issue.
“The vast majority of those permits are processed and completed within a reasonable amount of time and allow for good outcomes on those projects,” Matt Jones, a BNSF lobbyist told the committee. “We also work with cities and towns local governments on a wide array of other real estate projects, and we are committed, as with the utility permits with these other community-based projects, to good outcomes, and we often are willing to agree to low-cost leases, often donations in order to get these projects done for the benefit of the community.”
As for two towns — Thompson Falls and Colstrip — that had serious concerns with the BNSF permit process, Jones apologized and said he’d “dig in” to see what went wrong. Thompson Falls waited months for communication from BNSF, while Colstrip was forced to pay an expensive fee for a utility permit. In Colstrip’s case, the project was being funded by grant money that had an expiration date — it became a choice of either completing a needed infrastructure project at high cost or wait and potentially lose out on the money altogether.
“And I’m extremely sorry, personally and on behalf of BNSF that the process has been so difficult for those two situations,” Jones told the committee.
But other local leaders, NaDean Brown, the mayor of Richey, and Steve Zachmann the mayor of Baker, pointed to problems they’ve had with the railroad company. 
“I think I’d like to reiterate the request for some expediency and a format to follow something a little more standard,” Zachmann said. “We’ve got a number of issues.”
Zachmann said trains sometimes stand still over railway crossings and BNSF has not communicated well on the issue, adding, “my most recent letter of 2023, has gone so far unanswered.”
Jones said that BNSF had interest in working with the League of Cities and Towns on education outreach about the permit process. The railroad company has reached agreements with energy co-ops and broadband providers in Montana, Jones said.
“I think we could come to an agreement in principle, with the League of Cities and Towns, in terms of, you know, what the expectations should be there. I think, our track record with the other organizations we’ve worked with, we do a good job of meeting those expectations,” Jones told the committee.
Committee chairman Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said it was “important” the issue got resolved.
“After today’s presentation, it sounds like many of these communities and businesses that we’re seeing deal with the railroads are being treated more like hostages than partnerships,” Zolnikov said. “And yes, there are solutions, but the solution is to call one person in the entire state, which is a reaction to a problem, not a process that gives clarity and a route forward.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BNSF-JH-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

Wes Moore, left, and Comptroller Brooke Lierman at the Sept. 10, 2025, meeting of the Board of Public Works. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Board of Public Works approved $465 million Wednesday to expand the number of beds available for placement of foster children, in what state officials called a “critical” step toward meeting youth care needs.
The Department of Human Services contracts — $279 million for three year period and another $186 million for a two-year renewal — would be split between 31 child placement agencies statewide and would fund a total of 2,013 placement beds, an increase of 4.8% from the current levels.
Expanding the number of beds prevents out-of-state placements and reduces the number of children forced into extended stays in hotels and hospitals when other space is not available, said Maryland Human Services Secretary Rafael López.
“Ideally, we don’t want them [youth] to get to the point where they have to remain in a hospital at all,” López told Maryland Matters after the board meeting. “And the expansion of beds is one of those solutions.”
The contracts will support both treatment foster care services (TFC), for youth with emotional, behavioral or psychological challenges, and independent living program (ILP) services, which help youth in foster care prepare for independent living. While the number of beds overall will grow from 1,920 to 2,013, the number of ILP beds will go from 290 to 335, a 15.5% increase.
This contract comes amid recent efforts by the Department of Human Services to “modernize the child welfare system,” said López, such as weekly staff meetings to review individual children’ s cases and the hiring of a hospital liaison who is in contact with hospitals caring for Department of Human Services youth.

“We are prioritizing the right bed and the right service for the child — that is our number one priority, and their safety is our highest priority,” López said after the board meeting.
In January 2023, when the Moore administration took office, the department was using “almost manual processes” for how it and its 24 local offices received youth into the system, and lacked statewide standards, López said.
“The contracts with these 31 providers really demonstrate, I think, a key first step in the state’s commitment to ensuring the best possible outcomes for our youth,” said Comptroller Brooke Lierman, one of three Board of Public Works members, with the governor and treasurer. “This is obviously just one of the legs of the stool of rebuilding our foster care system and our child placement system.
“Under this administration, what we have seen is a shift in priorities to make sure that we are taking care of the kids who have been left in a situation that they didn’t ask for and that is out of their control,” Lierman said.
López told the board that the department has been working to lower the number of hospital and hotel overstays since January 2023 — reducing the number of hospital overstays from 21 in February 2024 to 10 this month, and cutting the number of 54 to 11 in the same period.
The board agenda noted the number of youth in overstays was higher prior to January 2023, but there was no statewide tracking of youth overstays.
“While this is still 21 too many of our young people in Maryland, we are determined to get to zero for the first time in Maryland’s history,” Lopez said. “This work is not yet complete, but an important step in the right direction.”
Richard Barth, a distinguished professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, thinks the increase in beds and placement options is a “significant step forward.”
“Many youth who have been interviewed about their experience in care say they’re appreciative of the chance to be in care because they had no other good options, but that the services didn’t fit their needs very well,” Barth said Wednesday. “A greater supply of options for placements of children are likely to lead to a better match between what they actually need and what we’re providing them.”
Variations of placements, such as strengths in education or vocational issues, may appeal more to individuals, Barth said. He thinks there need to be more options for youth to enroll in residential schools and support for those looking to transition to higher education, as well as a larger effort to return youth to their homes.

Since then, the question of whether the requirement to write the date on a mail ballot’s return envelope has been an issue in every election.","A Pennsylvania mail ballot envelope (Capital-Star photo)For more than a century the commonwealth’s Supreme Court has followed a presumption that voting rules passed by the legislature don’t violate the state constitution’s free and equal elections guarantee unless they make voting so difficult they amount to a disenfranchisement.
An attorney for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Republican National Committee argued before the high court Wednesday that opponents of the commonwealth’s troublesome requirement to put the date on mail-in ballots can’t make that claim.
“There’s nothing objectively difficult about completing the declaration or filling in the pre-printed date boxes on the ballot return envelope,” John Gore said, adding that in the 2024 presidential election, compliance with the date requirement neared 100%.
“If a voter wants to avoid the requirement entirely, the voter can simply vote in person, which is the most popular method of voting here in Pennsylvania. That’s the end of this case,” Gore said.
Chief Justice Debra Todd noted the trouble with the date requirement is that it’s not usually a question of whether a voter wants to comply, but a mistake that leads to the voter’s ballot being set aside.

In the 2022 election for governor, that caused about 10,000 mail-in ballots not to be counted, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania said. Even after the state redesigned ballot envelopes to prompt voters to write the month, day and last two digits of the year, 4,500 ballots were thrown out because of missing or incorrect dates in 2024.
“Even if this date requirement was not intended as a disenfranchisement trap. We now know that that’s what it has become,” ACLU of Pennsylvania lawyer Stephen Loney said.
An amendment to the Pennsylvania Election Code made voting by mail without an excuse an option for voters for the first time in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the question of whether the requirement to write the date on a mail ballot’s return envelope has been an issue in every election.
It has been challenged in several courts without a conclusive decision. Most recently, the Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to vote and the 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law.
Gore said the GOP filed a petition Tuesday asking the federal appeals court to rehear the case en banc, in hopes that a larger panel of judges would reach a different conclusion. 
The case before the Supreme Court stems from a special election for the state House in September 2024, when the Philadelphia Board of Elections disqualified 69 ballots because of missing dates.
“Two of those voters, Miss [Susan] Kinniry and Mr. [Brian] Baxter, were eligible lifelong voters whose most fundamental rights as Pennsylvania citizens are at stake,” Loney said, noting the state constitution clearly bars interference with the right to vote.
“However you try to slice it, a practice of disqualifying votes for non-compliance with a meaningless handwritten date requirement … it diminishes the right of suffrage, and it’s untied to any government interest,” Loney said.

The ACLU sued on their behalf and days before the 2024 election, the Commonwealth Court ruled that all mail-in ballots must be counted regardless of errors in the date. The Supreme Court granted a GOP request to stay the ruling, meaning that missing or incorrect dates would cause mail ballots to be set aside in the presidential election.
In analyzing whether the requirement is constitutional, the Supreme Court also asked lawyers for their thoughts on the level of scrutiny they should apply to determine whether some infringement on voting rights is permissible because it serves a clear governmental purpose.
In this and past cases on the date requirement, the GOP has argued the handwritten date serves purposes ranging from preventing election fraud to preserving the solemnity of voting. 
Election officials have said the date serves no purpose because every mail-in ballot is stamped with the date and time when it is returned to the election office. The state’s Statewide Uniform Registry of Voters system also allows officials to track each ballot with a bar code. 
“So given that we have two procedures to determine the actual date that it was received, what purpose can it possibly achieve for the voter to insert that date?” Todd asked Deputy Attorney General Brett Graham.
Graham described the requirement as part of a “belt and suspenders” approach to protecting the election system. 
Ben Fabens-Lassen, who represented the Philadelphia Board of Elections, said election officials have a process to segregate untimely ballots and said he disagreed with the “belt and suspenders” metaphor.
“The hand written date is more like this tie. It has no functional purpose and it serves no purpose in holding up my pants at all,” Fabens-Lassen said, drawing laughter from the court. “The date on a ballot declaration doesn’t serve any purpose and it doesn’t solve any actual or imagined problem.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0679-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

A transgender sheriff’s deputy seeking gender-affirming medical care through a county-operated health plan in central Georgia was handed a loss by a federal court Tuesday.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a trial court’s decision in favor of Houston County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Anna Lange and sent the case back to the lower court.
“After everything I’ve been through, it’s crushing to know I will have to continue to fight to get what a jury already said I was entitled to,” Lange said in a statement. “This should never have happened to me, and it shouldn’t happen to anyone else.”
Lange has served with the Houston County Sheriff’s Department since 2006. She came out as transgender and began to medically transition in 2017, according to court documents. She sued the county in 2019 after seeking gender-affirming surgery and being denied because the county’s insurance policy excludes “drugs for sex change surgery” and “services and supplies for a sex change and/or the reversal of a sex change.”
In 2022, a federal judge in Georgia ruled in Lange’s favor that an employer cannot exclude or deny coverage for transition-related medical treatments from its employee health insurance plan. Judge Marc T. Treadwell, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Macon, cited Bostock v. Clayton County, a U.S. Supreme Court case out of Georgia affirming that transgender people are protected from discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Houston County appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, where last May a three-judge panel initially upheld the lower court’s ruling. But in August, the appeals court vacated that ruling and granted a rehearing in front of the full court.
In Tuesday’s ruling, the full court cited United States v. Skrmetti, a 2025 U.S. Supreme Court case in which justices upheld a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Justices found that the ban was not discriminatory because they said it was based on a patient’s age and medical need rather than their sex or transgender status.
“The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Skrmetti applies equally here,” reads the 11th Circuit’s opinion. “The County’s policy does not pay for a sex change operation for anyone regardless of their biological sex. … Lange is a natal man. If Lange were instead a natal woman who wanted a female-to-male sex change, the insurance policy would not pay for it. Or if Lange were a natal woman who sought coverage for the same male-to-female sex change that Lange received (perhaps for a male dependent), the County’s policy would operate in the same way—it would deny coverage. Nothing about the policy exclusion turns on whether the County’s employee is a man or woman.”
In a dissenting opinion, Judge Nancy Abudu wrote that the majority’s opinion echoed arguments opposing past laws banning interracial marriage and “serve as fodder for those who oppose legal rights for transgender people.”
“Lange was denied coverage, and thus access, to medically necessary treatment by a healthcare coverage exclusion that limits an adult’s control over their own body,” Abudu wrote. “The importance of bodily autonomy crosses political and religious lines and has been illustrated by, for example, the recent challenges to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines. … Our Constitution does not permit courts to pick and choose which people warrant protection under the law based on the personal views of a subset of the population.”
In a statement, Lange’s lawyers expressed confidence that she will prevail at trial.
“While we are deeply disappointed in the court’s decision, we remain focused on vigorously fighting for Anna’s right to medically necessary healthcare and will continue to do so as the case proceeds,” said attorney Jill Grant of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.

The General Assembly is meeting in special session to revise the state’s eight congressional districts so Republicans are likely to win seven instead of the six they currently hold. The Missouri House has already approved the map sought by Trump, who on Tuesday demanded on social media that the Senate do the same.
“The Missouri Senate must pass this Map now, AS IS, to deliver a gigantic Victory for Republicans in the ‘Show Me State,’ and across the Country,” Trump wrote.
To push the bill to final passage by Friday, Republicans had to get the two bills passed in the House into position for committee hearings on Thursday. But before that could take place, the chamber had to vote on rules for the session and Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin rolled out revisions intended to make House bills the Senate’s top priority.
And to get those revisions passed, they voted to shut off debate — using a once-rare motion known as the previous question. This year saw a major break from tradition, when Republicans used the motion to slam through partisan priorities at the end of the regular session in May.
It was the first time since 2017 when the previous question was used during a regular session.
The proposed rule changes triggered a Democratic-led debate that consumed two hours before Republicans forced a vote.
For about two hours, Democrats accused the Republicans of cheating by substituting the new rules instead of using the rules used during this year’s regular session — and for the veto session that took place just minutes before the chamber convened for the special session.
“For those of you that are going to be here for a few years, why would you give away your power just to make today a little bit easier?” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia. “That doesn’t make any sense, and it really saddens me, because I don’t know where it stops.”
State Sen. Stephen Webber, D-Columbia, looks to the Senate dais in a disagreement over Senate rules (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The new rules were not distributed before the session convened and many Republicans were not informed in advance the changes were coming.
State Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence, said he was given the new rules and the bill on congressional maps approved in the Missouri House with the expectation he would be an automatic vote in favor of both. But Webber’s point was valid, he said, and he’s not ready to go along.
“I’m nobody’s puppet. I will never be anybody’s puppet,” Nicola said. “I’m not going to come down here and be expected to rubber stamp anything. That is not what I was elected to do.”
But when the chamber voted on the previous question, Nicola went along.
The previous question motion is used commonly in the Missouri House, but until this year it was considered a last resort in the Senate. When the votes were held, Democrats started calling the presiding officer of the Senate “Speaker” instead of “President.”
“There are no speakers in the Missouri Senate,” said state Sen. Jason Bean of Holcomb, who was presiding at the time.
Following the vote, the House bills were read and the Senate will meet at 9 a.m. Thursday to move them to committees for hearings later in the day.
 Flipping the 5th District

The Republicans’ target is the 5th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, a Democrat who has been in office since 2005. The map being considered would split the district into pieces, putting portions in the 4th and 6th districts and adding enough Republican votes to what remains to flip the district to the GOP.
Gov. Mike Kehoe also wants lawmakers to pass a state constitutional amendment raising the majority requirement for passing constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition. 
Instead of a statewide majority deciding the questions, initiative proposals would have to win majorities statewide and in every congressional district. That would allow as few as 5% of voters to decide the question.
But it is Trump’s insistence on a new congressional map to shore up the GOP’s shaky majority in the U.S. House that is the main focus of the special session.
During a caucus of the Republican senators Wednesday, Trump called Kehoe and spoke to the members through the governor’s phone.
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, insisted in an interview that the special session was not called just because Trump wanted it. The proposed new map puts all of Schroer’s county into the 3rd Congressional District — it is now split between the 3rd and the 2nd districts — and he said that will keep a community together in the same district.
But when asked whether Kansas City, which is almost entirely in the 5th District but would have its population split among three in the proposed map, deserved the same consideration, Schroer said it did not.
“Donald Trump is encouraging Republicans to grow a spine, and stop bending the knee to the Democrats to avoid filibusters like we did in 2022,” Schroer said. “It’s really helped and it’s binding the Republican Party back together.”
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, D-Kansas City, compares the State Senate to the House, remarking about the lack of debate allowed (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Democrats have vowed to challenge any new map in court and plans are being formed to force a statewide referendum on the bill. On Monday, Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh will hold a hearing on a lawsuit filed by the NAACP challenging the legal basis for calling a special session.
At a news conference on Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said Republicans are rigging congressional elections because the policies they have pursued since Trump took office again are proving extremely unpopular.
And, he said, Republicans are trying to protect Trump from being shown to be a friend of deceased child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“The thing that frightens them the most, the thing that keeps them up at night, the thing that sends cold sweat down their back as they rub elbows at their elite country clubs is that if Democrats retake the House, they will release the Epstein files,” Beck said.
The Capitol was filled with opponents of the redistricting plan on Wednesday. And as the Senate adjourned for the day, Suzanne Till of Dent County said she would be back to continue the opposition on Thursday.
“If we don’t at least make a presence, then they’re going to railroad us,” Till said. “And also, I’m just gobstopped that they would just so openly, and brazenly, try to snatch away voters’ voices.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_beck3-scaled-e1757547726290-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana Speaker of the House Brandon Ler criticized an 8% tax hike in Missoula County and said the increase is evidence more property tax reform is needed in the Treasure State.
“Montanans deserve stability, not surprise increases every budget cycle,” said Ler, a Republican from Savage, in a statement earlier this week. “It’s time to have a serious discussion about putting limits on local mill increases in future sessions so families can plan and budget with confidence.”
But Missoula County Commissioners said the impact on residential homeowners actually amounts to an 11% decrease — and the dollars are mostly going to paying a living wage for staff to provide services residents expect.
Even with the decrease for residential payers, the county budget can be larger because legislative changes mean other classes of property taxpayers, such as agriculture, pay more, said Chris Lounsbury, chief administrative officer for Missoula County.
He said the change is the Montana Legislature’s response to an earlier reappraisal that resulted in a roughly 35% burden shift onto residential payers in Missoula, and the current adjustment pushes roughly 21% back to other classes.
“Both sides of the aisle did a good job of pointing out whenever you change tax policy, it does have impacts in ways you can’t 100% predict,” Lounsbury said.
Lawmakers passed a property tax reform package in the 2025 Montana Legislature after intense debate, but on behalf of Republican leadership in the House, Ler said the increase in Missoula “highlights the need for future reforms.”
Property taxpayers also have been protesting their reappraisals this year, albeit not to the degree they filed appeals in 2023.
Representatives of local governments, however, pushed back at the idea of further curtailing their ability to collect taxes.
House Republicans call for more reform
In the statement from House Republicans, Ler said lawmakers are prepared to consider in the 2027 legislative session proposals that would “place reasonable caps on local mill increases.”
“Such measures would provide predictability for taxpayers, bring accountability to local budgets, and prevent families from being blindsided by sudden hikes,” the news release said.
The Legislature currently caps local government mill increases at roughly half the rate of inflation, and a spokesperson for Ler said the Speaker doesn’t have a specific number in mind for where to move the cap at this point.
In the 2025 session, the Legislature passed a bill to require local governments to represent voted levies in dollars instead of mills — because mills are confusing to the general public.
A mill is a tax rate equal to $1 for every $1,000 in taxable value. If a county levies 25 mills, the cost to a property taxpayer is $25 for every $1,000 in taxable value.
Jennifer Olson, with the Montana League of Cities and Towns, said local governments already are making that change from House Bill 20, which takes effect on Oct. 1.
“I think there’s a general sentiment that provides transparency,” Olson said.
However, she also said it’s important for local governments to be part of the conversation about property taxes from the beginning because they are on the “ground floor” when it comes to providing basic services, things like police and fire.
Municipalities account for roughly 10% to 15% of total property tax bills depending on the district and voted mills, she said.
Currently, she said, the cap at half the rate of inflation — averaged over the previous three years — limits the ability of local governments to maintain its responsibilities, such as to manage its sewer treatment, or even to grow responsibly.
“What is it, holistically, that a community needs to be able to bring in businesses or bring in tourism dollars or to support a large business economy?” Olson said.
But she said the months between legislative sessions are a good time to continue the discussion, especially because there’s no single answer.
“It is a complex system, and there are complex needs out there,” Olson said.
Missoula County responds
In an email to the Daily Montanan, Missoula County Commissioners said their budget already falls under the half-the-rate-of-inflation cap set by the Montana Legislature.
“Even with this limit, Missoula County has not levied the full amount of available mills for the past several years — including this year,” commissioners said. “Any statements implying otherwise come across as willful attempts to obscure the facts to score cheap political points.”
A budget presentation from the county showed the way the legislative change affected various properties.
For example, one home in Lolo with a higher market value this year compared to last would actually see a lower taxable value and pay $179.10 less in taxes, or 9% less — even with the overall tax increase in the county.
Lounsbury said that’s because mills get applied across all property tax classes. Since the tax values in residential went down, the money generated from residential properties will be smaller too.
“It basically shifts so those mills will raise less money in residential and more money in other property tax classes,” Lounsbury said.
Toward the end of the legislative session this year, some lawmakers said that shift was too large, although others said they didn’t have constituents complaining to them about the taxes big corporations pay.
In their email, Missoula County Commissioners said the county has proposed “innovative alternatives” to fund local governments besides property taxes, but “unfortunately, Speaker Ler has opposed those efforts.”
“We hope enough legislators on both sides of the aisle will continue working to reform the state’s property tax system in a way that won’t hamstring the revenue counties need to protect public safety, answer 9-1-1 calls, pave and plow roads, run elections and provide other services Montanans rely on,” the commissioners said.
Lounsbury, though, said he believes Ler, the county, and every legislator is “trying to do their best in a really complicated — really, really, complicated — (property tax) landscape.”
“There is no such thing as a perfect tax system,” Lounsbury said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-579-copy-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

(Photo by Perry Beeman/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report. 
The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years. 
The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year. 
“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said. 
Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields. 
“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”
Coal down, wind and solar up
In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state. 
The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation. 
Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”
Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.” 
Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024. 
“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”
The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants. 
According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. 
Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.
Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.
“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.” 
A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.” 
Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.
According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024. 
“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.” 
‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected 
Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers. 
According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years. 
Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years. 
“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.” 
Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”
“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”
‘Big beautiful’ law changes timeline for tax credits
Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032. 
The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits. 
Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report. 
“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said. 
But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa. 
“Even without the credit, the renewable generation will still be lower cost, but the credit certainly will have an impact and help customers overall,” Guyer said.

Sept. 10, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceIn continuing testimony from a hearing held earlier this summer, the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday invited AI watchdogs and business representatives to testify on a set of bills regulating the development of artificial intelligence systems and creating criminal penalties for individuals using AI for reasons outside of the law.
The committee heard testimony from the bills’ sponsor, state Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport, the committee’s chair, and other proponents in June.
Lightner welcomed additional comments on her proposed policies, which ranged from praise for potential security measures in AI development, to concerns that regulation at the state level could create a patchwork of differing rules. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Of the two pieces of legislation, Wednesday’s discussions largely focused on House Bill 4668, which would require developers training AI on broad sets of data to implement a number of safety and security protocols beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The protocols would manage risks, including the creation and release of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapon or a cyberattack perpetrated or assisted by an AI model.
Felix De Simone, the organizing director of PauseAI US, pointed to the unpredictability of how AI systems make their decisions, warning that there’s a lack of oversight and a lack of accountability in how these systems are trained.
De Simone pointed to remarks from Jared Kaplan, the chief scientist for Anthropic, which develops the Claude AI chatbot. Kaplan told Time Magazine: “we’re not sure if we can rule out the risk – the specific risk being uplifting a novice terrorist, someone like Timothy McVeigh, to be able to make a weapon much more destructive than would otherwise be possible.”
His comment came during discussion on the safety measures taken in releasing the Claude Opus 4 model.
“In short, we might soon be building AI systems that have goals of their own, that have the ability to create weapons, including biological weapons, and that can act autonomously without human oversight for extended periods of time,” De Simone told the committee on Wednesday. “Experts are warning us that this is a recipe for disaster and instead of rolling the dice and gambling with an uncertain future, we should act now to make sure that these worst case scenarios of autonomous, weapon-capable AI systems don’t come to pass.”
However, Tyler Diers, the Midwest executive director for the technology trade association TechNet, said trying to regulate advanced AI models is a continuous moving target, calling for Michigan to see how regulation efforts play out in other states with policies further along in the process, or to commission a study or task force on the topic.
He also raised concerns about House Bill 4668’s requirements mandating independent third party audits.
“I think it’s worth noting that there are no established third party audit standards and expertise in AI safety auditing, even at the federal or international level,” Diers said. “Mandating that developers who are investing in AI innovation in the state provide untrammeled access to their research to an unaccredited third party without sufficient technical depth, could miss critical risks or flag false positives.”
In light of conversations held over the Summer, Lightner recommended the committee refer House Bill 4668 to the House Communications and Technology committee, with all 10 committee members in attendance approving the motion.
The committee did not vote on Lightner’s House Bill 4667, which creates three new felonies to prevent individuals from using AI to commit a crime.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Election officials from Louisiana are reacting to the death of ultra-conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot Wednesday afternoon during an event at a Utah university. 
Videos circulating on social media show Kirk seated under an open tent at an outdoor amphitheater venue on the Utah Valley University campus as he was fielding questions from a large crowd. The audience scattered after hearing a popping sound. Kirk appeared to recoil from an impact and began bleeding from his neck. Witnesses said he was answering a question about gang violence and shootings when he was shot.    
Police in Utah have said they have a person of interest in custody but did not indicate it was the shooting suspect.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry called Kirk “a patriot in every sense of the word” in a social media post. The governor said he and first lady Sharon Landry were praying for Kirk, his wife Erika and their two children, along with the Turning Point USA organization that Kirk founded and led.
“It is important to recognize that the very idea of a representative republic is to allow for the free exchange of ideas that can be debated in a peaceful setting, so that we don’t have to fight it out in the street,” Landry said in a post on the platform X.
The governor also encouraged Kirk’s supporters to fly an American flag in his honor.
“He stood for the principles that made this country great: liberty, freedom, and prosperity, which are all of the things that the Left hates,” Landry added. 
Charlie Kirk dies after shooting at Utah Valley University

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, described Kirk as a “close friend and confidant” and said his death was “utterly devastating” in a statement.
“He will be sorely missed by so many,” Johnson said. “Every political leader must loudly and clearly decry this violence. Our prayers go out to his wife and young children. May he rest in peace.” 
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, said in an X post that he was “sad and digusted” to learn of Kirk’s death.
“Political violence is NEVER acceptable,” Scalise wrote. “The perpetrator of this horrific act must be held accountable … It’s past time for the incendiary rhetoric to come to an end, and we must see universal condemnation of this gruesome act.”
Eight years ago, Scalise barely survived a politically motivated mass shooting at a Virginia park where he and other GOP lawmakers were practicing for the annual congressional baseball game. Shooter James Hodgkinson also wounded a Capitol security officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist before being killed by return fire.
U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Madisonville, called Kirk a “courageous conservative” and said “his senseless death makes me sick,” in an X post.
“His legacy will live on through every freedom-loving American who watched his show, listened to his speeches, or attended one of Turning Point USA’s events,” Kennedy wrote.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, shared a brief prayer on Facebook and shared a post President Donald Trump made to his Truth Social platform that said “No one had or understood the Heart of the Youth in the United States better than Charlie.”
Without mentioning Kirk by name, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette, offered his own prayer on social media: “May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ shield us, strengthen us, and forever defeat the evil that threatens our anointed Nation under God.”
In her own X post, U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, asked for prayers for Kirk’s family “as they begin this unimaginable walk.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill also said she was praying for Kirk. 
“The videos circulating are both shocking and disturbing, which seem entirely inadequate to describe this horrible event,” she said in a statement. “Political violence has no place in our society.” 
Democratic officials from Louisiana also shared their reaction to Kirk’s death.
“Violence is never the answer — not in politics, not in life,” U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans said in an X post. “We can disagree without dehumanizing, and we can debate without destruction. My prayers are with Charlie Kirk and his family.”
“The tragic death of Charlie Kirk is a reminder of the painful moment our country is living through,” U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields said on X. “No matter our political differences, violence is unacceptable and has no place at all in our democracy. My thoughts and prayers are with Charlie Kirk’s family, especially his wife and children, as they mourn this loss.”
The event where Kirk was fatally shot was typical of his many visits to college campuses where he fields questions from students, including those who challenge his conservative viewpoints.
The Turning Point USA chapter at Louisiana State University had planned to host Kirk for an Oct. 27 event on campus. In response to questions from The Reveille student newspaper, the LSU chapter provided a statement from its national office that confirmed Kirk’s death and asked for prayers for his family.
Derek Babcock, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, praised Kirk as “a bold truth-teller, a courageous leader, and a patriot who never shied away from defending the values that built this nation.” He also called on younger party members to carry on Kirk’s legacy.
“The enemies of truth may have silenced his voice, but they cannot extinguish the fire he lit in your hearts,” Babcock said in a statement. “In this dark hour, I urge you to rise up, carry forward the torch of faith and freedom, and show this nation that Charlie Kirk’s legacy will not be buried with him. It will live on in you.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)In a far-ranging online town hall meeting on Tuesday night, U.S. Congressman Troy Downing, a Republican from Montana’s Second District, stood lockstep with the Trump administration, including the use of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., tariffs and support for the controversial rollback of the “Roadless Rule.”
However, he expressed concerns about the economic upheaval for the Treasure State’s agricultural community.
Since his election in November 2024, Downing has held four “telephone town hall” events, taking questions from callers, while avoiding larger town-hall formats. The topics discussed on Tuesday followed the contours of national issues, including the use of military, the Epstein files and unflinching support for fossil-fuel energy. Downing’s district covers the central and eastern part of the state. Montana’s other representative in Congress is Rep. Ryan Zinke, also a Republican who served as Secretary of the Interior for a time during President Donald Trump’s first term.
The mostly question-and-answer format allowed selected callers to lob questions at Downing, and several focused on concerns about the Epstein files and the National Guard’s use in Washington, D.C., and other American cities.
Downing said he wanted full transparency when it comes to the Epstein files but was worried about naming victims who want to remain out of the public spotlight. However, during the conversation about the topic, Downing did not mention President Trump or a new evidence linking him to Epstein’s nefarious activities, which have emerged this week.
“Republicans are on the side of truth and transparency when it comes to securing justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,” Downing said. “While other politicians make grandstanding (gestures) and engage in political theater, I will continue to advocate for transparency and a process that leverages the maximum weight of the law while protecting victims of these heinous crimes.”
  National Guard and the military 

During the roughly 45 minutes dedicated to questions from callers, several asked about the Trump administration’s use of the military in Washington, D.C., and some veterans’ expressed concerns that the presence was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which at least one federal court has affirmed.
Downing said that he fully supported the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act, while also offering support of Trump’s authority to use emergency powers to send in the troops.
When the first caller, identified as “Charles from Huntley,” asked “why the United States Army is invading our national (capitol) Washington, D.C.,” and other cities, Downing responded unequivocally.
“I don’t agree with your basic premise there,” Downing said. “This is a shining example of the United States of America and crime has gone crazy. This is not a state. It falls under the federal government, and I think the president of the United States has the prerogative to make sure it’s safe. I am very proud that this president made a decision to do something to make sure that it’s safe.”
However, widely published statistics show crime rates were falling in D.C. before Trump’s call-up of the National Guard, and Downing’s claim that crime had fallen after has not been verified.
Another caller asked if Downing supported the concept of the Posse Comitatus Act as well as the U.S. Constitutional protection against the military being used against citizens, except in extreme circumstances.
Downing expressed support for both the Constitution while also offering support for the use of the military.
“Mr. Downing, will you affirm your commitment to the Constitution, specifically the principle of Posse Comitatus, and be sure that in cities like Chicago, the military is never used as a police force against civilians,” said John, a caller from Whitehall.
“There’s nothing particularly new here,” Downing responded, pointing to the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard at the southern border. “This is exigent circumstances. This was a state of emergency because of the special conditions of an emergency exists in D.C. He did keep the peace there and dealt with those, and I believe he was within his constitutional authority. I just don’t subscribe to your thought that any of these acts have been unconstitutional.”
  Roadless rule 

Downing also seemed to break with the majority of Montanans on the U.S. Forest Service’s attempts to repeal the so-called “Roadless Rule,” which protects more than 6 million acres of federal public forest land in Montana from having roads or vehicle traffic.
Polling data for Montana specifically on the rule was not available, but in an analysis of public comments when the rule was first proposed, 95% of the more than 1.6 million comments on the rule supported the measure.
Conservatives argue such policies have hurt the economy and the health of forests by not allowing for “management” and by letting forests grow more thick, leading to hotter, more intense fires. Others say that the rule prohibits timber harvest and robs taxpayers of the chance to make money from federal lands.
However, environmental groups say that the rule protects the wilderness and many endangered species, as well as provides carbon sinks to capture carbon generated by fossil fuels. Furthermore, surveys done by hunting and outdoors organization show a widespread support of the rule. For example, the Backwoods Hunters and Anglers have come out in strong opposition to the change.
“I think in order to be true stewards, we need that,” Downing said. “I am very supportive or repealing the roadless rule, because I think it helps protect us in Montana from having bigger, hotter, more destructive fires.”
  The economy, tariffs and a federal government shutdown 

Downing’s town hall also spent time touching on various economic issues, including the economy, Trump’s use of tariffs and an impending federal government shutdown that could happen when funding for the government expires at the end of September.
Downing said that if the Republicans had not passed the “big, beautiful bill,” Democrats would have led America off a financial cliff, and he defended massive tax cut continuations that the Congressional Budget Office has said will add trillions to the debt problem — an issue which Downing hit on several times.
However, Downing defended the move, saying that taxes would have risen to pre-COVID levels that would translate to an average of $1,280 for the average Montana family in his district. He said that a closer reading of the economic plans shows a different outcome. He said that the CBO scored the measure as if the American economy would remain flat, but Downing said the Republican plans will supercharge the economy and don’t factor in economic growth.
“If we just have 3% growth, which is not anything, you know, unachievable — actually, I think we can do much better than that — then we actually reduce our debt over 10 years that this reconciliation bill covers,” Downing said.
However, federal statistics show that in the past decade, gross domestic product only hit above 3% once, in 2021 after the pandemic when it rebounded from a negative, -2.16% to a positive 6.06%, something most economists point out as an statistical anomaly due to COVID-19. The 10-year average GDP growth sits at 2.46% through 2023, the most current yearly data available. The last time the economic growth eclipsed 3% was in 2005.
Meanwhile, Downing told constituents that he didn’t think that Congress would let all the federal government shut down. Instead, he thought that the Democrats and Republicans would come together to pass “continuing resolutions” to fund most — if not all — parts of the government for a period of time, possibly until the end of the calendar year, in order to negotiate a budget that will take support from Democratic Senators.
“Do I want to sign a continuing resolution? Absolutely not. But given the chance to get a little bit of runway to get these bills through, hopefully by the end of the year, is a reasonable place so that we can start to get back to regular order and start doing the business of the people,” he said.
Finally, Downing echoed Trump saying that the U.S. economy may experience some temporary pain due to tariffs, but said he supported the president’s use of them in order to bring about better trade deals with foreign adversaries and friends alike. He didn’t explain what he meant by temporary pain, or how an economy being weighed down by tariffs would necessarily continue to grow at more than 3%.
“What I strongly believe is that the president is using tariffs to try to get to a point where we have fair and equitable trading agreements with our trading partners,” Downing said. “And I think a lot of this has been successful — incredibly successful.”
He said that instead of returning the money from tariffs to the American people that the Trump administration should put the money toward paying off the national debt.
“As a lot of people have said from the beginning, including the president, there might be some short-term discomfort until we get to a point that actually is a good place for the United States of America, for, you know, our industry, our production and some of these things are national security issues to make sure we are producing what we need to produce here,” Downing said.
In maybe one of the few areas where Downing began departing from the Trump policies was in the ripple effects the tariffs have caused in the agricultural sector. Many have expressed concerns that the trade deals lessened the value of Montana’s agricultural products, while making imported equipment and parts for agricultural operations more expensive.
“One thing that I have been very vocal with the administration about is agriculture,” Downing said. “People are concerned about the short-term increases in input prices, in cost of equipment, parts, and all that stuff. The biggest concern is knowing where things are going to settle in two months, in three months or six months. I’ve been very vocal with this administration that it’s hard for our producers, for our small businesses, to plan in the future with that ambiguity. I’m hoping  we start to see some stability in that short of time. I do think we end up settling with more jobs on shore, more manufacturing on shore, and more businesses investing in the United States of America.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-34-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959
,California,2025-09-10 22:47:13+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s bid to fast-track Delta tunnel stalls again,Rachel Becker,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/09/delta-tunnel-fast-track-dead/,"Water wonks say the proposal to speed the multibillion Delta tunnel project could rise again. ‘This is the zombie offspring of the zombie project,’ one opponent said.","In summary
Water wonks say the proposal to speed the multibillion Delta tunnel project could rise again. ‘This is the zombie offspring of the zombie project,’ one opponent said. 


In a blow to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ambitions to replumb the Delta, California lawmakers once again punted on his plan to fast-track a deeply controversial $20 billion tunnel project that would funnel more water to the south. 
Multiple sources in the Legislature say the clock has run out on a sweeping measure that would overhaul permitting, financing and other road blocks to the Delta tunnel project. The news comes as lawmakers and Newsom race to reach a megadeal that encompasses carbon trading, wildfire funding, energy transmission, and refinery issues. The governor’s office did not respond to CalMatters’ inquiry. 
While supporters acknowledge the tunnel bill has hit a dead end for now, this isn’t the first time Newsom has tried to fast track the project. And water watchers expect that it won’t be the last. 
“Even if action is delayed this year, the need for modern delta conveyance has never been greater,” said Jennifer Pierre, general manager of the State Water Contractors, a staunch supporter of the bill, in a statement. “The need is urgent, the support is broad, and the time to move forward is now.” 
Lawmakers representing Delta communities called the failure to fast-track the bill a relief. They have long said that building a tunnel to reroute water around the Delta would devastate communities, fish and local farms. 
“It’s going to be incredibly disruptive to my communities,” state Sen. Jerry McNerney, a Democrat from Stockton, told CalMatters. “They made a good fight, but we just were too unified for them to have any progress.” 
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City, said no amount of compensation for Delta communities would make up for the project’s lasting harm. 
“Once a short-sighted policy, always a short-sighted policy,” she said in a statement. “We will continue to stand strong and fight for the Delta and the communities who call it home.”
‘Let’s get this built’
The proposed tunnel, more formally known as the Delta Conveyance Project, would extend 45 miles from the Sacramento River to a reservoir near Livermore, bypassing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which serves as a critical hub for California’s water supply. 
It’s the latest iteration of a decades-old plan to funnel water deliveries from Northern California around, rather than through, the Delta — with the goal of shoring up water supplies for 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of agriculture largely in the central and southern parts of the state. 
Planning for the project remains underway, though it is fiercely opposed by conservationists, Tribes, Delta cities and counties, and the fishing industry. 
They fear the loss of water supplies, environmental degradation and years of construction that they say will make some towns uninhabitable. The state’s own analysis warned that a Delta tunnel would put salmon at risk. 
Newsom introduced the streamlining bill earlier this spring as a budget add-on, a strategy he’s used before that bypasses more extensive input from lawmakers. 
“We’re done with barriers  — our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future,” Newsom said May. “Let’s get this built.” 
Stalled, but not dead
The tunnel bill aimed to flatten roadblocks related to land acquisition, water rights decisions, funding and litigation. Delta lawmakers pushed back against it, as well as Newsom’s strategy of using the budget process to shortcut deliberations. 
“Drying out the north just to water the south doesn’t make it better at all, and it doesn’t make it fair,” Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, a Democrat from Elk Grove, said in May. 
Lawmakers tabled decisions on the bills until later in the session, and the Newsom administration continued to push for both the tunnel and the streamlining effort. 
Pierre, with the State Water Contractors, told CalMatters that the failure to fast track the project didn’t reflect Legislative opposition to the tunnel itself. 
“We had vote cards that demonstrated the majority in both houses,” Pierre told CalMatters. “This was not a function of a lack of support for the bill.” 
But McNerney said he thought the political cost for the administration became too high. 
“I think the governor realized that he’s got other battles to fight,” McNerney said. “It’s just not worth taking that battle to the wall.” 
Jon Rosenfield, science director with the San Francisco Baykeeper, said he hoped this was the last effort by the Newsom administration to “grease the skids” for a Delta tunnel. 
But, he added, “This is the zombie offspring of the zombie project … You understand if I don’t necessarily believe that this is the end.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/022525-DeltaTunnelHood-FG-CM-32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959

“You cannot change this funding and ask us to ‘hope’ that it’s OK,” said Erin Horstmeyer, whose disabled son received care from LifeScape before he died. 
“Families like mine, the people in this room, have lived on hope every single day of our lives,” she said. “All we do is hope, because we don’t know what the future holds for kids that have multiple disabilities.”

At issue is the state Department of Social Services’ plan to revise the methodology it uses to reimburse providers through Medicaid, the joint federal-state program providing low-income health insurance and disability assistance.
A rule dating to the 1980s allows LifeScape to be exempt from the state’s typical Medicaid reimbursement rates, according to LifeScape’s Leah Orsack, resulting in more funding for the unique care the organization provides. According to Kristin Tuttle, also of LifeScape, the proposed rule change would reduce LifeScape’s annual funding by about $9.7 million. LifeScape’s locations in Sioux Falls and Rapid City serve more than 3,300 children and 500 adults in South Dakota.
At the outset of the public hearing at the state’s One Stop building in Sioux Falls, however, Department Secretary Matt Althoff said the initial proposal that sparked the outcry would no longer be pursued — news that surprised both the organization and those in attendance. 
He said the proposal came about due to the department needing to modernize its decades-old reimbursement system in alignment with federal guidance. He said the methodology for reimbursing LifeScape will still need an update, but did not offer specifics on a new plan. 
“We have to modernize the methodology,” Althoff said. But when pressed on whether LifeScape’s bottom line would hold steady, he conceded, “We don’t know that.” 
Althoff also acknowledged, “South Dakota is a lot worse off without LifeScape. We need LifeScape to be there.”

The two-hour hearing was filled with tearful testimony from parents and advocates describing how LifeScape’s outpatient therapies and specialized programs helped their children walk, talk and participate in daily life. Many stressed there are no comparable providers in the state, particularly after Althoff suggested others exist. 
Some attendees bristled at Althoff responding to speakers during the testimony period of the public hearing, saying it gave the impression the department was dominating a forum meant for public input. One attendee attempted to seize the microphone from Althoff and spoke over him when he declined. 
The advocates urged the department to delay any changes until the real-world impacts are better understood.

Colchester officials have given preliminary approval to a proposed $8 million lakefront lodging development — a move that has angered many residents who now plan to appeal the decision.
Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp. describes its development as a “20-room inn” with five “cottage-style” units built into the slope overlooking Malletts Bay to house a restaurant and event space, with almost 100 parking spots mainly on the opposite side of East Lakeshore Drive.
Opposed residents dispute that characterization of the development — called The H at Malletts Bay — and continue to raise concerns about its potential effect on water quality, increased traffic and pedestrian safety, and setting a precedent for large development along the scenic waterfront.
“We are disappointed with the decision, believe it misstates many of the facts and contains flawed analysis. The group is seriously considering taking an appeal,” said Brice Simon, a lawyer representing a group of town residents.
Residents have also objected to the board trying to reframe its own definition of what constitutes an inn, Simon said, because the town’s development regulations do not allow hotels or motels in the lakeshore district.
An inn, by the town’s rules, is an establishment containing at least six rooms but no more than 20 for living or sleeping purposes. No more than 40% of the rooms may contain apartment-type furnishings such as a kitchen, bath, living space and separate bedroom.
The project proposes 20 rooms, all or almost all of which contain typical apartment-type furnishings, according to an email shared by town officials. The floor plans submitted show such features in at least 10 of the 20 rooms, he further noted.
“There has never been a satisfactory explanation from the developer as to how the project meets the definition of an inn. Therefore, it is a hotel or motel, and is not an allowed or conditional use in the district. Therefore, the application should be denied as a matter of law,” Simon wrote in an email.
The town’s Development Review Board issued its 46-page decision on Sept. 3. Residents said they expect to discuss the matter at the board’s meeting Wednesday night. 
Development Review Board members did not respond to a request for comment.
The inn proposal is not on Wednesday meeting agenda, and the board does not plan to discuss it at the meeting, according to Cathyann LaRose, director of planning and zoning.
“The DRB, as a quasi-judicial board, is prohibited from discussing items which are not on an agenda or part of an active deliberative session. The Hazelett properties have no active applications and a decision has already been issued for the preliminary plat application. The Board will not and cannot discuss this property amongst themselves or with members of the public,” she wrote in an email Wednesday. 
The developers and their representatives did not respond Wednesday to a request from VTDigger to comment on the residents’ concerns.

‘Grossly negligent’
“This is one of the most egregious town decisions I have ever read,” resident Jack Scully said in an email.
“They’ve sold our souls for $8 million. Shame on them,” Jeanne Welch, another resident, said.
By rubber-stamping a large development that requires building into the slope right against the bay, the board is “ignoring” a town ordinance on what could be built there, what constitutes a traffic study, and its responsibility to uphold the state’s Shoreland Protection Act, said Lori Barg, a West Lakeshore Drive resident. 
“It seems like they look for every hole in their regulations and miss the heart of the regulations,” she wrote in an email.
It’s “grossly negligent of the DRB” to approve a plan that has severe environmental and ecological impacts on Malletts Bay and on Lake Champlain, said resident Julie Elmore, one of many who recently organized to oppose the project.
“Colchester is abdicating its responsibility for water quality in Malletts Bay,” said Marilyn Sowles, a former selectboard member and a member of the resident group Save the Bay, which has also pointed to possible environmental detriments the project poses, as well its inconsistency with the 2019 Town Plan that provides an outline for land use and town development.
In meetings this year, Sowles voiced her opposition to the town allowing developers to cut down many trees and combine the two small Hazelett lots to make way for an “inn,” restaurant, spa and event center that would connect to the new sewer being built on Lakeshore Drive, causing significant traffic delays.
“It appears that the $16.7 million Malletts Bay sewer, supposedly being built to protect water quality, is instead enabling additional development along the lakeshore with no consideration by either the town of Colchester or the Colchester Development Review Board for how this new development will impact water quality,” Sowles said. “There will be no stormwater treatment along the lakefront and 43% of the existing trees will be cut. Stormwater runoff will only be treated on the opposite side of West Lakeshore Drive.”
Colchester resident Marilyn Sowles displayed this photo at a public hearing on the proposed inn project. She said this is what the shoreline consisting of the Hazelett parcels with the marina and the trees look like from a boat on Malletts Bay. Courtesy photo
When the sewer project was discussed last year, many worried the town was investing in future development over environmental mitigation, but officials disputed those arguments. Town Manager Aaron Frank at the time said the new sewer line would not have the capacity to support excess development, citing limited roadway capacity and existing land use regulations on East and West Lakeshore drives.
Prior to that, the town reworked zoning for Lakeshore Drive in 2022, eliciting the same environmental and over-development concerns.
Hazelett, which has long owned the plots, demolished the vacant Beach and Boat Motel in 2017 and has contemplated rebuilding there since, according to the Colchester Sun.
Residents have a 30-day period to appeal the decision in the environmental division of the Vermont Superior Court. The preliminary plat approval is one step in the review process. The applicant has to apply for a final plat review, which will include at least another hearing and final decision, according to LaRose.
The environmental court is the last recourse for the concerned residents, Elmore said. It is tragic, she added, that they have to incur legal fees to fight a development the town should have rejected based on its own rules.
“To me, the decision is unconscionable,” Welch said. “It guarantees that West Lakeshore will be immeasurably more congested and unsafe for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists than it already is. Not to mention the loss of that iconic view. All to provide a playground for the rich and line a developer’s pockets.”

Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted with all Democrats to advance the amendment.The move by Schumer was the latest attempt in Congress to force Republicans on the record about the Trump administration’s announcement in July that it would not release any further materials from the federal sex trafficking case against Epstein.“If Republicans vote no, they'll be saying to the American people, you should not see the Epstein files,” Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. “I asked my Republican colleagues, after all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, ‘Why won't you vote yes?’”The financier, who for years surrounded himself with powerful and influential figures, died awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019. He and President Donald Trump had a well-documented social relationship that Trump says turned sour before allegations against Epstein surfaced.A bipartisan effort in the U.S. House aimed at forcing the Department of Justice to release all investigative materials has not gained enough Republican support to bypass House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, for a floor vote.The discharge petition filed by Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and California Democrat Ro Khanna has the signatures of all Democrats and four Republicans, including Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

Free.,"After near-deportation, attorneys seek protections for immigrant children in HHS care",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-near-deportation-attorneys-seek-protections-immigrant-children-hhs-care,,"WASHINGTON — Attorneys for a group of 10 Guatemalan children who were nearly deported late last month asked a federal judge during a hearing Wednesday to grant protections for all unaccompanied minors in the care of a Department of Health and Human Services agency handling refugee resettlement.Efrén C. Olivares, the lead attorney of the National Immigration Law Center representing the unaccompanied Guatemalan children, told U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly that President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps to remove children from other countries “under the guise of reunification” with their parents.The administration’s actions did not comply with federal law or constitutional due process rights, Olivares said. The government also backtracked on its initial claim that the parents had requested their children’s removal.The attorney asked Kelly to bar the removal of all children in the care of the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement who are not subject to final orders, removal or voluntary departure. The group should be certified as a class, he said.“We believe the entire class is at risk (of removal),” he said.At a minimum, Olivares said, the court should bar the removal of all Guatemalan children who met those criteria. Nearly deportedA flurry of legal action over Labor Day weekend halted the removal of the 10 children, who were woken up in the middle of the night and put on planes to Guatemala before a federal judge issued an emergency restraining order.Olivares said the move appeared to be part of an administration initiative to deport children in the agency’s care.“We did not hear a denial that there are plans… to get out of the country children from other nationalities,"" he said of the U.S. Department of Justice’s position.He also told Kelly that some children were pulled out of foster homes.If a preliminary injunction is granted, Olivares asked if it could also direct ORR to place those children back in their foster homes, rather than agency-run shelters. ‘Unfortunate’ incidentCongress has carved out special legal protections for immigrant children, such as a 2008 law that requires minors be placed in immigration proceedings and able to access legal counsel.Olivares said in court Wednesday that the Trump administration broke that law over Labor Day weekend when officials tried to whisk the children out of bed for deportation to Guatemala. Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, asked DOJ attorney Sarah Welch if the government has the right to wake children in the middle of the night on the weekend to remove them from the country. “I think everyone can agree it's unfortunate that the children were frightened and woken up in the middle of the night,” she said. Welch objected to class certification because there could be children in the class who want to return to Guatemala. But she acknowledged that the government had no record in the case of a child wishing to return. She added that in general, non-U.S. citizens facing removal could not be considered irreparably harmed because they could return to the U.S. Kelly said he would make a decision as soon as possible. Parents were unaware, court records showAfter immigration attorneys asked the court for emergency relief in the early morning hours of Aug. 31, a judge who heard the emergency request blocked the government from deporting the roughly 2,000 Guatemalan children in ORR’s care.DOJ attorneys initially argued that the parents of the children being removed had requested their children be returned to Guatemala. However, in court documents, the children said their parents were unaware. A declaration from one parent, referred to as B.M.R.P., detailed how she was not notified by either government of her child’s removal.“I think she is in danger if she does return to Guatemala,” B.M.R.P. said. “All I ask is that you help my daughter stay safe – help her stay safe by not returning her to Guatemala.”Kelly pressed Welch on those declarations and information from Guatemala's government that the parents of the children were not notified they would be returned to the country. Welch said that the Trump administration would withdraw its claim that the parents of the Guatemalan children had requested the return of their children.However, she said the Trump administration’s position is that a parent’s request is not required for a child to be deported. ‘I feel traumatized’Court filings also detailed the children’s experience. They said after being woken in the middle of the night, they were rushed to buses where they waited for hours without food. One 17-year-old, referred to as H.D.C.R., said the stress of being removed and potentially returned to Guatemala caused them to faint and be hospitalized for three days. “I suffered so much that I will never forget the bad time I had that weekend,” H.D.C.R. said, adding that they wish to remain in the U.S. to fight their immigration case.Many of the children also expressed their fear of returning. A 16-year-old girl, A.J.D.E., said her sister was murdered in Guatemala and she feared the same would happen to her. She said she felt relieved when she learned she was not going to be deported to Guatemala because of Sooknanan’s order.“The impact is real. I feel totally traumatized. I don’t even know how to explain it,” A.J.D.E. said.",,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959
,New Jersey Monitor,2025-09-10 22:11:13+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,"Insurance funds, brokerage call for investigation of state watchdog",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/10/insurance-funds-brokerage-call-for-investigation-of-state-watchdog/,"The comptroller, who has raised the ire of multiple public agencies, is now the target of a politically connected insurance brokerage firm.","Lawyers for a politically connected insurance brokerage firm want a special counsel to investigate acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh for his recent probe into public joint insurance funds. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A fight between New Jersey’s comptroller and a group of public joint insurance funds escalated late Tuesday when a group of the funds demanded the watchdog apologize for his recent “slanderous” investigation of the industry and accused his office of attempting to obtain confidential documents.
Their complaint echoes one made by insurance brokerage Conner Strong & Buckelew and a related entity operating under the name PERMA that alleges attorneys with acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh’s office improperly attempted to secure documents the firms said are protected by attorney-client privilege. Conner Strong, which has ties to South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, wants Gov. Phil Murphy to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Office of the State Comptroller.
“Pursuant to OSC’s current policy, memorialized in both written correspondence and in recorded statements, OSC officials have repeatedly insisted that they are entitled to review attorney-client privileged materials involving the subjects of OSC inquiries, without providing any credible legal basis justifying OSC’s access to such sacrosanct information,” Deborah Gramiccioni, counsel to Conner Strong and PERMA, said in a Tuesday letter to Murphy.
The separate letter from the chairs of six health insurance funds to Murphy, legislative leaders, and regulators called for the comptroller to apologize and retract his report. They also called for a state investigation into the office and legislation to “rein in this out-of-control agency and end these abuses of power.”
Walsh’s investigations have raised the ire of multiple public and private entities, with some of them suing in state and federal courts to prevent his office from obtaining documents or releasing reports to the public.
A spokesperson for the comptroller’s office defended its most recent investigation and its officers’ conduct, saying enabling legislation provides it access to even confidential records.
“The Legislature granted OSC broad access to public documents, including confidential ones, to ensure transparency and protect taxpayer funds,” said Pam Kruger, the spokesperson. “This specifically includes reviewing attorney-client communications for public entities, among a host of otherwise confidential materials.”
In a report released Tuesday, Walsh’s office claimed it found a bevy of contracting and ethics violations related to joint insurance funds, which allow local governmental units to pool their workers to dilute risk and secure health benefits at lower prices than they could achieve on their own.
The report alleges that Conner Strong and PERMA, which holds contracts to administrate the three funds examined by the comptroller’s review, for years failed to tell regulators and joint insurance funds they are legally and practically a single business, drafted solicitations meant to exclude other vendors, and oversaw procurements they bid on.
It’s not clear what documents the comptroller’s office is alleged to have tried to obtain. According to Kruger, the insurance funds did not provide any privileged information, nor did the office compel such productions.
“This is an attempt to distract. Every fact in OSC’s report is supported by documents or recorded interviews with (health insurance fund) trustees and vendors,” she said.
The Conner Strong and PERMA letter recounts portions of emailed exchanges and interview transcripts between officials in the comptroller’s office and those at PERMA and the health insurance funds.
“As part of OSC’s procurement reviews, we may ask for documents that are otherwise confidential and/or subject to privileges, so long as the requested documents represent government records. To the extent that any responsive documents may be confidential and/or subject to a privilege, you must still provide them responsive to OSC’s request,” comptroller attorney Alysia Walsh said in a Dec. 14 email, according to the letter.
Conner Strong is one of the nation’s largest insurance firms and was founded by Norcross, who took a leave of absence from the brokerage last year after he was indicted on unrelated racketeering charges that were later dismissed by a Superior Court judge. A Norcross spokesman said this week he has not returned to the firm.
The brokerage is contracted as program manager for the funds reviewed by the comptroller. In that role, Conner Strong provides professional and other services to the funds.
Language in the comptroller’s enabling statute gives the office broad access to public documents, including those typically excluded from disclosure under the state’s Open Public Records Act so long as they are related to an audit, performance review, or contract review the office is conducting.
Documents subject to the attorney-client privilege are listed as exempt from OPRA. That could make them subject to disclosure to the comptroller if the documents were government records related to one of the office’s investigations.
Some records created by private entities holding public contracts are considered government records disclosable under OPRA, subject to relevant exemptions, said CJ Griffin, an attorney specializing in public record matters.
“If they are created for the public agency, they should be subject to OPRA unless an exemption applies. But the entire contractor itself isn’t subject to OPRA,” she said.
For example, briefs a private municipal lawyer drafts for their township would be disclosable under OPRA, while the private law firm’s own payroll records would not be subject to disclosure, said Griffin, who has represented the New Jersey Monitor in numerous legal matters.
But statute is not the only thing that governs the disclosure of documents and information shielded by attorney-client privilege. The judiciary’s Rules of Professional Conduct also set limits on such disclosures.
Court rules generally bar attorneys from revealing information related to their representation of a client, though they include exceptions that require disclosure to prevent the commission of certain crimes.
Other provisions in court rules allow, but do not require, attorneys to breach privilege to defray the impact of a client’s illegal activity that was furthered by attorney services, mount a defense in a conflict with a client or to charges stemming from a client’s behavior, prevent a client from harming themselves, or comply with other law.
“OSC’s position does seem like a broad reading of its authority. Attorney-client privilege is pretty sacrosanct,” said Griffin.
It’s not clear whether the comptroller’s ability to breach attorney-client privilege has ever been tested in court.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) and Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) declined to comment through spokespeople. Murphy spokeswoman Tyler Jones did not comment on Conner Strong’s demand for a special counsel but said the governor’s office “stands ready to work with the Legislature to reform industry practices for local government and school board health insurance funds to promote fair competition and reduce conflicts of interest.”
Murphy had a tense relationship with Norcross and the power broker’s legislative allies in his early years as governor, though their relations thawed in later years.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-10 22:08:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Insurance department approves double-digit rate hikes for 2026 health plans,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/10/rate-hikes-ct-health-plans/,"The rate hikes come amid a flood of federal health policy changes, including new cuts to Medicaid and expiring federal subsidies.","Officials with the Connecticut Insurance Department announced Wednesday they have signed off on an average rate hike of 16.8% for 2026 state-regulated individual health plans.
They also approved an average increase of 11% on small group policies.
The rate hikes come amid a flood of federal health policy changes, new cuts to Medicaid, tighter restrictions on care at community health centers and expiring federal subsidies.
The plans collectively cover about 224,000 residents (158,000 in individual policies and 66,000 in small group).
“All of us – regulators, consumers, and industry – have faced unprecedented uncertainty this year due to the federal government’s pending changes to health care coverage,” Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais said in a statement.
Insurers originally requested an average rate increase of 17.8% on individual health plans. Insurance department officials said that number recently rose to 23% after factoring in the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies, which will run out at the end of the year.
Insurers had also asked for an average hike of 13.1% on small group plans.
“We have to figure out a way to address this, because these double-digit increases every year are not sustainable for families,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the legislature’s Insurance Committee, said Wednesday. “With housing, the cost of living, wages not keeping up, the impact of these tariffs – which is going to make everything more expensive – and now you add this, it’s going to be unsustainable.”
“These double-digit increases reflect a badly broken system that we cannot afford to ignore,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “The insurers, the hospitals, the pharmacy benefit managers have zero incentive right now to negotiate lower costs for Connecticut families. Too many families are drowning in these ballooning premiums, deductibles, coinsurances and copays.”
Three insurers sell plans through the state’s exchange, known as Access Health CT: Anthem Health Plans, ConnectiCare Insurance Company and CTCare Benefits Inc.
Anthem asked for an average rate hike of 14.2% for individual policies (later adjusted to 18.6% to reflect expiring subsidies) that cover 83,790 people. It was granted an average increase of 13.6% (with rate hikes ranging from 6.1% to 22.5%, depending on the plan).
ConnectiCare sought an average increase of 26.1% (later adjusted to 34.5%) for individual policies that cover 3,685 residents. The insurance department signed off on a 20.3% average hike.
And CTCare Benefits requested an average increase of 21.7 % (later adjusted to 28.5%) for individual plans that cover 70,160 people. A 20.6% average hike was approved.
Anthem also sought a 13.2% average hike for its small group plans that include 48,666 residents. It was granted an average increase of 11.2%.
“I would thank the insurance department for reducing the rates from what was initially requested, but I think they’re still too high,” said Karen Siegel, deputy director for Health Equity Solutions. “These increases are going to be difficult to impossible for families to accommodate, and people will lose coverage. Given all the changes coming to the [insurance] marketplaces in the next few years, rates are going to continue to go up, and the state has an obligation to contain costs.”
Insurers have cited rising health care costs, including the price of prescription drugs and greater demand for medical services, as reasons they sought rate increases.
Stephanie DuBois, a spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut, said the company’s request this year was due to more policyholders needing higher cost services, including emergency department visits.
“Our submitted ACA rates are based on the health care services we expect members to access next year, along with the anticipated costs associated with that care,” she said. “Specifically, there has been an increase in ACA members utilizing higher-cost services, including emergency room care and behavioral health services, as well as some prescription drugs and specialty pharmacy. These rates also reflect our ability to deliver on behalf of consumers in Connecticut given the changes at the federal level.”
Insurers had bigger rate hike proposals this year than in 2024. Last year, insurance companies asked for an average rate hike of 8.3% on individual plans and 11.9% on small group. The state approved an average increase of 5.9% on individual policies and 7.8% on small group.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ahct-desk.jpg,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nikki Gronli was a bureaucrat, but in a political atmosphere where that label can be an insult, she wants to benefit from it.
“There’s bureaucracy that gets in the way at times, but that bureaucracy is often put in place by Congress,” Gronli said in a speech officially announcing her campaign for Congress on Wednesday in downtown Sioux Falls. “What if someone who understands the roadblocks goes to D.C. to eliminate the bureaucracy?”
The Democratic former Biden administration U.S. Department of Agriculture appointee said that experience — helping rural communities address infrastructure, public safety, housing and broadband needs — prepared her with skills and knowledge to “cut the red tape” if she’s elected next year to South Dakota’s lone U.S. House seat.
That includes adjusting federal program requirements and processes to streamline projects or ensure a safety net for small communities relying on federal programs, Gronli told South Dakota Searchlight after the announcement, citing her history with the USDA.

She also worked with current congressional delegates in her role as well as state leaders, nonprofits, private businesses and other federal agencies to find solutions during her tenure as state director of USDA Rural Development for three years. Before that, she worked in marketing and advertising.
“Too often I think people don’t ask, ‘Can we do this? Can we change this? Can we find some people in Congress who are willing to work on this?’” Gronli said. “I would like to go there and do that.”
Gronli, who lives in rural Dell Rapids, promised the crowd that she’ll continue to host public town halls throughout the state, which she began leading this spring.
One of the Aurora native’s biggest issues to address, if elected, will be representing South Dakota farmers, she said. She blamed the Trump administration tariffs and trade policies for “damages already taking effect” on farmers because of stalled trade markets and low commodity prices. 
“It’ll take around 60 new countries and deals to replace the Chinese soybean market that disappeared overnight and may never be the same again,” Gronli said.

China is boycotting U.S. soybean purchases this fall in response to President Trump’s tariffs. Farmers may get help from the federal government, Gronli said, but it could be too late for some.
Congress needs to “take back its responsibility” regarding tariff policy, she said, while working with the executive branch to compromise, rather than “give over their power” to the current administration. 
“As I’ve traveled the state, never once have I been told by a farmer or a rancher that all they want is a bailout,” she said. “They want markets. They want a system that leaves some money in their pocket at the end of the season for all of their hard work, and that is not too much to ask.”
Trade policies have an impact in South Dakota beyond the agricultural economy, Gronli added, including tourism and small businesses.
“This is the place where I can say that trickle-down economics actually does work,” Gronli told the crowd. “If our top industries in South Dakota are financially damaged, that trickles down to Main Street. That impacts our businesses, it impacts our workers and it impacts our families. I cannot sit back and watch Washington fail South Dakota.”
Jackley calls for improved legal immigration policy while launching his campaign for Congress

Gronli is the second Democrat to announce her candidacy for Congress. Bill Mawhiney, of Sioux Falls, announced his candidacy last month. Scott Schlagel of Dell Rapids filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission as well, setting the stage for the state’s first Democratic U.S. House primary since 2012. 
State Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson introduced Gronli at the event, highlighting her dedication to the Democratic Party and her work to connect South Dakotans with federal decision makers during her time with the USDA.
Larson told South Dakota Searchlight that she supports Mawhiney and Gronli and is excited about the prospect of a Democratic primary.
Among Republicans, Gronli said, the primary race will be a “fight.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, is running for governor next year. South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley is the only Republican candidate so far to formally announce his campaign for the U.S. House seat. State Sen.

“That fight is going to be about who more closely aligns with the very policies Washington is using to harm South Dakota — policies that harm our top industries, our workers and our people,” Gronli said. “On this side of the aisle you’re going to see issues elevated and, I guarantee, good conversations about how we best solve them.”

One of the hospitalized students is the suspected shooter.
The shooting was reported shortly after noon and is believed to have taken place on school grounds but not inside the building, Jacki Kelley, a sheriff’s office spokesperson, said in a press conference. It was not immediately clear how the shooting suspect was injured, but Kelley said she did not “believe law enforcement fired any rounds today.”
“There is no danger. No one needs to be locked down,” Kelley said. “The school has been swept, so now the hard work begins. We have to to protect our crime scenes, and we have to put together a case.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation and that state troopers were assisting in the response.
“Students should be able to attend school safely and without fear across our state and nation,” Polis said. “We are all praying for the victims and the entire community.”
The Democratic state lawmakers who represent the Evergreen area said Wednesday that they were shocked and outraged by the shooting.
“I am horrified by the shooting at Evergreen High School, and my heart breaks for the students, educators, families and school personnel whose start to the school year has now been marked by inexplicable violence and harm,” said Rep. Tammy Story of Conifer. “I am hoping for the swift recovery of the victims, and my thoughts are with them and their families.”
“I am heartbroken by the news of the shooting at Evergreen High School and angered at another senseless act of gun violence in our state,” said Sen. Lisa Cutter. “Schools need to be safe places, and this tragedy is yet another reminder that we must do better to protect our kids.”

A bipartisan committee advising the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is calling for the closure of the state’s three ICE detention centers. (Photos courtesy the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General)A bipartisan New Mexico committee that advises the federal Civil Rights Commission is calling for the closure of the state’s immigration detention facilities, citing concerns about detainee treatment and the private companies running them.
The 11-person New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released  findings and recommendations Monday stemming from an inquiry that began in October 2024. The board looked into civil rights at the state’s three immigration detention facilities in Otero, Cibola and Torrance counties. The committee’s chair and vice-chair dissented from the majority’s opinion. 
After the months-long review, which included several hours of testimony from immigration advocates, lawyers and other experts, the committee called for the facilities’ closure and for more oversight of  the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and its contractors.

Apart from the Torrance County manager, the committee did not hear from detention center wardens, county officials, private prison operators or federal officials. Those people all were unable or declined to participate, despite the committee going to “great lengths to solicit participation” from diverse perspectives, according to the committee’s 27-page report. 
In total, the state’s three detention centers house approximately 1,500 ICE detainees, a number that has steadily increased amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. The committee largely cited testimony from January, before Trump’s inauguration, and alleged abuses from before his second term began. 
Neither the committee’s advice to the Civil Rights Commission nor the Civil Rights Commission recommendations to federal or local authorities are binding. However, the committee recommendations echo recent calls from some Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who have called on the Legislature to ban ICE detention in the state. 
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced last week that banning the facilities will not be on the agenda of an Oct. 1 special session, but that she’d put the measure on the legislative agenda early next year and would push for the strongest possible legislation to ban ICE detention centers here. 
NM Republicans — and one Democrat — tour Otero ICE Detention Center 

Proponents of the bans say the state should neither enable nor profit off the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort; opponents note the economic benefits of the jails and say New Mexico offers relatively humane facilities as compared to other states or countries. 
The committee on July 28 voted 7-2 to accept a series of findings and recommendations regarding the facilities. Those findings note that detained immigrants in New Mexico have “limited access to legal representation and rights education,” and are being housed in unsafe facilities. Regarding the latter point, the report cites repeated issues with food services and cleanliness at the facility in Torrance, as well as a 2022 surprise Inspector General report from the facility calling for its immediate closure.
“In addition to concerns about the overall sanitation of the facilities, there were even more worrying issues raised about safety in these facilities. These issues include people going without medical attention, drug trafficking by facility staff, and being assaulted by other inmates and guards,” the committee report states. 
The committee also found that those problems were rooted in the contracting process between ICE, counties and private facility operators. 
Federal inspectors demand ICE relocate migrants detained in Torrance County

“This contracting system can create some circularity and confusion when it comes to oversight and accountability and leaves each stakeholder only partially accountable for addressing issues,” the report states. 
As for recommendations, the committee said that the Commission on Civil Rights should push the federal Homeland Security Department, which oversees ICE, to immediately begin closing the three facilities; stop using county-level passthrough contracts with private prison operators in New Mexico; expand community-based alternatives to detention; and create an independent oversight entity. 
Committee Chair Chris Saucedo and Douglas Turner, the vice-chair, both of Albuquerque, disagreed with their colleagues’ recommendations to close the facilities or terminate county-level passthrough contracts. 
“We believe that neither of these recommendations address the issues related to the creation and expansion of alternative detention options, enhancing oversight and transparency of detention operations and standards, or the creation of platforms to release prompt and accessible information to the public,” they wrote. 
Saucedo did not respond to Source’s request for comment. Turner declined to comment. 
New Mexico Rep. Pamelya Herndon (D-Albuquerque) is also on the committee. She did not respond to Source’s request for comment.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Mayor LaToya Cantrell, whose extensive, publicly funded travel is at the heart of a federal corruption case against her, will be barred from leaving the country pending trial, a judge ruled Wednesday during Cantrell’s first court appearance since she was indicted last month.
Cantrell entered a not guilty plea to 11 criminal counts — including conspiracy, wire fraud and obstruction of justice — during the arraignment hearing before Magistrate Judge Karen Wells Roby, who set the terms for Cantrell’s release pending trial.
While Roby released Cantrell without bail, she will have to surrender her passport. The mayor’s domestic travel, meanwhile, will be limited to the 13 parishes under the jurisdiction of the New Orleans federal court, unless she gets clearance from the court.
The charges, first announced Aug. 15, stemmed from Cantrell’s alleged years-long affair with New Orleans Police Department officer Jeffrey Vappie, who served on her four-person security detail.
Federal prosecutors allege that Cantrell illegally used her position to spend personal time with Vappie while he was on the clock – often earning overtime pay. The indictment also details how Cantrell allegedly arranged for regular out-of-state trips with Vappie, spending over $70,000 in taxpayer dollars on his travel costs, which included not only transportation, but meals and overtime pay. In addition to charges of conspiracy and wire fraud, federal prosecutors further charge that Cantrell lied and withheld evidence from prosecutors, even after being subpoenaed.

Cantrell arrived at New Orleans federal court shortly after 1 p.m., flanked by her attorney Eddie Castaing and city Communications Director Terry Davis. She did not offer comments to members of the press waiting outside.
“Regarding today’s arraignment, the City of New Orleans will continue to stand by its policy of reserving comment,” a Wednesday afternoon statement from the Mayor’s Office. “Additionally, on the advice of counsel, the Mayor will not make any statements before or after today’s legal proceedings.”
Cantrell’s appearance in court marks the beginning of the end of her turbulent second term as mayor, a period that has been marked by unrelenting scrutiny, from a strident effort to recall her from office to multiple clashes with the New Orleans City Council, not to mention years of rumors swirling about her alleged affair with Vappie.
Now, Cantrell, who came into office on a victorious note as the city’s first female mayor, will exit with a different moniker: New Orleans’ first mayor to be indicted while still in office.
Castaing did not respond to a request for comment.
“Residents that paid any attention to this are not surprised that she got indicted,” Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor and current president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, told Verite News, noting that Vappie was first indicted last year for charges of wire fraud due to overtime he logged while allegedly spending personal time with Cantrell.
“And I think most people are sophisticated enough to realize that neither one of them were indicted for having a personal relationship; They were indicted for using public funds to finance and pay for their personal relationship,” he added.
Goyeneche also said there was another reason residents might not be surprised: This isn’t the first time that Cantrell has gotten in trouble for misusing city funds.
“What we’re seeing her do as mayor she did to a lesser extent as a member of the city council,” Goyeneche said.
In October 2017, during Cantrell’s first successful bid for mayor, records revealed that Cantrell had charged several thousand dollars of personal expenses, including travel and meals, to her City Council credit card. She later reimbursed the city for the expenses.
“The only difference between being a councilmember and the mayor is you get a lot more power and you get access to a lot more money,” Goyeneche said.
In a similar scandal in 2018, Mayor Megan Barry of Nashville admitted to a personal relationship with her head of security, which also involved improper use of city funds to pay for travel and overtime pay. Barry later resigned from office and pleaded guilty to charges of theft. Under her plea agreement, she was sentenced to three years of probation and required to reimburse the city for the misspent funds.
‘New Orleans … in a negative light’
The indictment of Cantrell has brought additional national attention to New Orleans – a Democratic stronghold in a Republican-dominated state. The city has frequently been at the center of conservative maelstroms, from how the city has handled encampments to the implementation of a citywide ID program. Most recently, President Donald Trump suggested last week that he might deploy the National Guard to the city to address crime, despite the fact that violent crime has been on a rapid decline in the city over the last few years.
Cantrell, as the leader of the blue city, is arguably one of the most prominent Democrats in Louisiana. Perhaps because of this, local and state Democratic Party leaders have taken a cautious approach in talking about her indictment.
“So, it’s always a concern to me when New Orleans is portrayed in a negative light,” Leslie Bouie, chair of the Orleans Parish Democratic Executive Committee, told Verite News.  “However, I do feel that the mayor deserves a day in court. She hasn’t been convicted of anything yet. So, for me, it’s unfortunate that it happened. I’m concerned that it did happen. But I think we have to wait and see how it plays out in the courts.”
Dadrius Lanus, the new executive director of the Louisiana Democratic Party, declined to comment on the indictment – saying he wanted to watch it play out – but said that he was confident that the city would soon be led by a strong Democratic leader after the fall municipal elections.
“There are some tremendous candidates right now who have represented the Democratic Party well, and we are just very excited about who could possibly win,” Lanus said. “The city of New Orleans is one of the most vibrant and creative cities across our country, and it serves as a platform not only for our state, but also for the Democratic Party.”
When the indictment was announced last month, the Democratic front-runners in the mayoral race – Councilmembers Helena Moreno and Oliver Thomas, as well as State Senator Royce Duplessis – largely refrained from attacking Cantrell and instead emphasizing the need for a fair trial.
“The mayor is entitled to a presumption of innocence and a vigorous defense,” Moreno said in a statement at the time.
“The announcement today reminds us of the need to let the justice system work in a fair, timely fashion and without regard to politics or preference,” Thomas said.

Route 46, about 3 miles east of Enderlin, North Dakota. (Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota is still waiting on a response to its request for federal disaster relief to help communities damaged by June tornadoes. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong requested federal disaster relief on July 21 for the June 20-21 storms.
Most federal disaster requests are resolved within 30 days, but some can be approved within two weeks, Darin Hanson, North Dakota’s emergency management director, said during a meeting Wednesday.
“We’re well beyond that 30 days now, obviously,” Hanson told members of the North Dakota Emergency Commission. “I do expect to see some sort of an answer here not too much farther after Oct. 1 at the worst case scenario.”
The Emergency Commission on Wednesday gave the Department of Emergency Services the authority to spend about $16 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and about $2 million in state funds – contingent on the presidential disaster request being approved.
Hanson said the emergency funds will be issued to local subdivisions to cover costs such as road damages and debris cleanup operations. The June storms included 20 confirmed tornados, baseball-size hail and straight-line winds over 100 mph. Nineteen North Dakota counties are part of the federal disaster relief request.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

“One of the other large pieces is the electrical co-ops,” he said. “They got a lot of damage from this storm.”
The delay in federal approval comes as other states have seen disaster requests denied by FEMA during President Donald Trump’s second term. In May, Stateline reported that denials included relief requests for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington. FEMA also denied a request that would have extended relief for victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.
Amrstrong last week also requested federal disaster aid for August storms. 
In a joint letter to Trump from North Dakota Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and North Dakota U.S. House Rep. Julie Fedorchak, the lawmakers said they support Armstrong’s request for federal disaster relief from the storms in June, as well as more recent storms in August.
They added the size and scope of the storm damage across the state would “entirely deplete” state and local emergency funds and would leave nothing available for future disasters.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A Roseland resident has filed a lawsuit against nearby Smitty’s Supply Inc. following the Aug. 22 explosion and subsequent fire at the petroleum products facility that took more than two weeks to extinguish. 
Ronnie Polezcek filed the case Tuesday in state court in Tangipahoa Parish. It alleges Smitty’s Supply failed to properly maintain its facility and follow state environmental and safety regulations. As a result, the explosion caused widespread property damage, livestock deaths and the disbursement of toxic chemicals that contaminated nearby homes and businesses, the complaint alleges.
Polezcek, who lives about 3 miles from the facility, said he had to evacuate and relocate livestock after thick black smoke, soot and oily substances blanketed his property, according to a statement from his attorneys with the San Diego-based Singleton Schreiber law firm.
The explosion, followed by a summer afternoon rainstorm, spread oily residue over neighboring properties and a nearby elementary school where students evacuated mid-day on a Friday and returned four days later. 
Firefighting crews battled flare-ups at the Smitty’s Supply site for over two weeks, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally reporting Tuesday that the fire was 100% extinguished. Crews remain at the facility to watch for signs of rekindling, according to a statement from Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller.
Polezcek alleges his home, pond, pasture and vehicles were coated with toxic residue, forcing him to burn contaminated hay and rendering his land unsafe for grazing or water use. One of his cows gave birth to a stillborn calf shortly after the explosion, according to his lawsuit.
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.
Polezcek’s complaint said the company stored large amounts of petrochemical products at the site, including antifreeze, motor oils, lubricants, greases, hydraulic fluids and detergents. The combustion of these products released hazardous volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, dioxins and fine particulate matter. Some of the substances have been linked to cancer and long-term environmental harm, according to the lawsuit.
Polezcek’s lawsuit also cites the history of Smitty’s Supply with environmental regulators, including its federal Clean Water Act violations. The business has been assessed $161,522 in EPA penalties since 2022. 
The agency has categorized the facility’s status with regards to following federal pollution regulations as “Significant Noncompliance” for more than four years.
“Smitty’s knew the risks of its operations yet repeatedly failed to comply with the most basic safety and environmental standards,” said LaCrisha McAllister, Polezcek’s lawyer. “This explosion was not an accident, it was the foreseeable result of years of negligence, and the surrounding community is now left to deal with the fallout.”
The lawsuit, which is separate from litigation initiated by the Louisiana Environmental Action Network last week, does not list a specific dollar amount Polezcek is seeking, but it said he hopes to recover property damages, livestock relocation expenses, lost income, cleanup costs, environmental monitoring and other losses associated with the incident.

Chuck Grassley appeared on ""Iowa Press"" on Sept. 15, 2023. (Screenshot via Iowa PBS)U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Wednesday he believes U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is qualified to take the U.S. Senate seat following Sen. Joni Ernst’s exit from the race.
In a news conference Wednesday, the longtime Iowa Republican senator said he has enjoyed working with Ernst and is “disappointed” she is retiring. Last week, Ernst announced she will not seek reelection in 2026, which was shortly followed by Hinson, who has represented Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District since the 2020 election, announcing her campaign for the seat.
Hinson quickly gained the endorsements and support of many major Republican officials in Washington, D.C., including President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott. Several Iowa Republicans, such as U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and state House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann, have also backed her campaign.
Though Hinson has a clear lead in gaining institutional support, there are other Republicans competing to become the GOP nominee in the 2026 U.S. Senate race. Former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian state legislative candidate, are also campaigning for the position. Carlin had also challenged Grassley in the 2022 U.S. Senate primary.
While Grassley said he believes “Ashley’s fully qualified to succeed (Ernst),” he stopped short of giving an endorsement, saying “I’ll leave it at that at this point.”
Ernst’s retirement and Hinson’s move to the U.S. Senate race have added to the number of open races in Iowa for 2026. In addition to having no incumbents in the U.S. Senate and 2nd Congressional District races, the governor’s seat will be open as Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek another term in 2026. Iowa’s 4th Congressional District seat will also be open as U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra has an “exploratory” committee pursuing a gubernatorial bid.
The two open congressional seats are in districts considered less likely to be competitive. Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Districts, represented by Republican U.S. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn respectively, are considered by political forecasters to likely be the most competitive. Grassley said he believes Iowa Republicans will win in 2026, but acknowledged there were “tough races” ahead.
“We have these tough races at the top, and then Joni’s race, and then we already have two competitive races, normally, in southern Iowa (for) two districts,” Grassley said. “I don’t think Ashley’s will be competitive, but if it is, we’ll have to work through it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-6.24.37-PM-1024x615.png,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

(Photo courtesy of Talis Abolins)A Spokane jury has ordered Washington state to pay $42 million to a woman the state failed to protect from years of childhood sexual abuse.
The striking payout in Jessica Hilton’s case adds to the state’s skyrocketing financial liability for a range of misconduct, from wrongful terminations to deaths in prison and mishandled child welfare cases.
Washington’s payouts jumped from $72 million in fiscal year 2018 to about $500 million in the most recent fiscal year that ended June 30, according to state data. Since the beginning of July, the state has already paid out nearly $89 million, not including the $42 million verdict.
A series of court rulings over the past few years opened up the state to further liability. Unlike many other states, Washington has no cap on the damages that can be paid out.
The state’s legal defense costs have similarly risen, to tens of millions of dollars per year.
The alleged misconduct the state is paying for often goes back decades and child welfare cases have driven much of the recent rise in claims. 
Hilton’s lawsuit deals with negligence primarily in the 1990s. 
Despite the 1990 conviction of Hilton’s stepfather for raping her sister, the state’s Department of Corrections and Child Protective Services allowed him back into Hilton’s life, according to court filings.
Both agencies declined to comment, other than to say they were “reviewing the jury’s decision and evaluating our legal options.” The state can appeal the lower court verdict.
Hilton’s lawyers said she was prepared to accept a settlement before trial of less than 10% of the eventual verdict, but the state only offered less than $1.5 million.
“Who is doing the risk adjustment for the state of Washington?” asked one of her attorneys, Talis Abolins, who previously worked for the state attorney general’s office for 14 years. 
Abolins expects the state to appeal.
The case
The stepfather, Raymond Mashtare, was ordered to serve more than four years in prison, but allowed to remain out of custody on a suspended sentence with a number of conditions, including state supervision, sex offender treatment and staying away from children “without a responsible adult present,” according to court documents. 
Hilton’s mother, who suffered from severe alcohol use disorder, was assigned as Mashtare’s chaperone. She would sometimes be so hungover, she’d have Mashtare watch her daughters, according to Hilton. Child Protective Services, now known as the Department of Children, Youth and Families, was reportedly aware he could be living with the victim of his crime.
Despite Mashtare’s history of sexual abuse of children, the Department of Corrections allowed him to continue spending time with his stepdaughters. The agency also failed to share information with the courts that would have forced him into prison, according to Hilton’s lawyers. The state countered that Mashtare didn’t violate the conditions of his supervision, and so there was “no basis to have Mashtare go before the court.”
Over the next decade, the state repeatedly failed to step in to protect Hilton from the sexual abuse of Mashtare and others, Hilton alleged.
“If it were not for the fact that the following events are plainly seen from available government records, it would be difficult to believe the level of recklessness by these defendants,” one expert contracted by the plaintiff wrote in court papers. 
In 1998, for example, Hilton’s mother told Child Protective Services that she’d seen Mashtare molesting Hilton. And Hilton disclosed abuse from two years earlier that she hadn’t shared out of fear of her mother blaming her. Still, CPS left Hilton in her mother’s home with a finding she faced “little or no risk” of abuse, documents state.
In court filings, the state argued officials did their due diligence investigating each referral related to Hilton. The state’s attorneys wrote that CPS investigations “were so extensive that they actually exceeded” the standard required by law.
In the 1998 example, state investigators reportedly learned Mashtare was no longer living in the mother’s home with Hilton. Prosecutors never charged Mashtare for the alleged abuse of Hilton.
The verdict
After a nearly monthlong trial in Spokane County Superior Court, a jury at the end of August awarded the $42 million verdict, with 70% of the negligence attributed to Child Protective Services (now the Department of Children, Youth and Families) and 30% to the Department of Corrections. A judge made the verdict official on Friday. Attorney fees will be decided separately.
Hilton was represented by Abolins, of mctlaw, and Eric Fong, of Fong Law.

 “Ben & Jerry’s has become successful precisely because people know it stands for something deeper than ice cream,” Cohen and Greenfield wrote in Tuesday’s letter.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield launched a campaign Tuesday to “free” the ice cream company they founded from its current owner Unilever, claiming the larger corporation has stifled the Vermont-based outfit’s political messaging and actions.
The campaign includes two open letters authored by the Ben & Jerry’s founders, which address their concerns to the current owners and prospective investors. The move comes after years of conflict in and out of court between Ben & Jerry’s and the London-based Unilever, and seeks to mobilize public support to pressure the larger company to allow its subsidiary to regain independence. 
The letter to current board members is addressed to the Magnum Ice Cream Company, an emerging spin-off entity which will own a number of brands including Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever announced last year. In the statement, the founders argued that since Unilever purchased Ben & Jerry’s in 2000, “the commitments made to us, our employees, and our customers (have been) eroded.”

In particular, the founders wrote, the company’s “freedom to pursue its social mission,” which the founders say was enshrined in the original sale, has been infringed on a number of occasions in relation to “issues such as Gaza, indigenous rights, the Trump administration, and DEI.”
Jerry Greenfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement to VTDigger on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Unilever said, “Ben & Jerry’s is a proud part of The Magnum Ice Cream Company and is not for sale.” The spokesperson added that Unilever remains “committed to Ben & Jerry’s unique three-part mission — product, economic and social — and look(s) forward to building on its success as an iconic, much-loved business.” 
Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever last year for allegedly trying to block the smaller company’s statements on Gaza, after turmoil over the company’s presence in Israel and the West Bank. Earlier this year, Ben & Jerry’s claimed in court that its parent company ousted longtime CEO David Stever over his support for progressive activism, sparking protests from employees.
“That is not the Ben & Jerry’s that we founded,” Cohen and Greenfield wrote in Tuesday’s open letter. “Ben & Jerry’s has become successful precisely because people know it stands for something deeper than ice cream.” 
The pair also addressed prospective investors, urging them to reconsider their involvement with Magnum and advising them that the founders, as well as many employees and customers, no longer support the direction of the company under current management.
“We intend to campaign for an independent Ben and Jerry’s, owned by values-aligned investors,” Cohen and Greenfield said.

(Photo courtesy of Jefferson County Sheriff's Office)Three students were hospitalized in critical condition after a shooting at Evergreen High School, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday. One of the hospitalized students is the suspected shooter.
The shooting was reported shortly after noon and is believed to have taken place on school grounds but not inside the building, Jacki Kelley, a sheriff’s office spokesperson, said in a press conference. It was not immediately clear how the shooting suspect was injured, but Kelley said she did not “believe law enforcement fired any rounds today.”
“There is no danger. No one needs to be locked down,” Kelley said. “The school has been swept, so now the hard work begins. We have to to protect our crime scenes, and we have to put together a case.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation and that state troopers were assisting in the response.
“Students should be able to attend school safely and without fear across our state and nation,” Polis said. “We are all praying for the victims and the entire community.”
The Democratic state lawmakers who represent the Evergreen area said Wednesday that they were shocked and outraged by the shooting.
“I am horrified by the shooting at Evergreen High School, and my heart breaks for the students, educators, families and school personnel whose start to the school year has now been marked by inexplicable violence and harm,” said Rep. Tammy Story of Conifer. “I am hoping for the swift recovery of the victims, and my thoughts are with them and their families.”
“I am heartbroken by the news of the shooting at Evergreen High School and angered at another senseless act of gun violence in our state,” said Sen. Lisa Cutter. “Schools need to be safe places, and this tragedy is yet another reminder that we must do better to protect our kids.”

(File/Mint Images/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A transgender student in Berkeley County can continue using the bathroom of his choice while a lawsuit continues, the nation’s highest court said Wednesday.
The order applies to only one student. The ninth grader, identified in court filings as John Doe, is suing the state over a budget clause requiring transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their biological sex at birth.

25A234 Order 
Last month, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said that student could use the school bathroom of his choice while the case proceeded, overturning a lower court’s decision. Attorney General Alan Wilson’s office asked the Supreme Court to overturn that decision, arguing the appeals court got it wrong.
The nation’s high court declined to overrule last month’s ruling. That decision “is not a ruling on the merits of the legal issues presented in the litigation,” reads the Wednesday order. “Rather, it is based on the standards applicable for obtaining emergency relief from this Court.”
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed and would have granted the state’s request, according to the order.
That lawsuit is ongoing. The budget clause, first added to the state budget last year, remained in the spending plan that took effect July 1. School districts that don’t enforce it risk losing a quarter of their funding.
Although the order applied only to the one student involved in the lawsuit, it showed support for all transgender students, said Alexandra Brodsky, an attorney working on the case for Public Justice.
“We are so thrilled that our client will continue to be able to use boys’ restrooms while his appeal continues, and hope today’s decision will provide hope to other trans students and their families during these difficult times,” Brodsky said in a statement.
Wilson said he was confident the state would ultimately win the lawsuit. He emphasized that the decision applied only to one student.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, opening an afternoon news conference in Miami, said he and the First Lady Casey DeSantis have known Kirk for more than 10 years.
“He’s somebody that a lot of people have a great regard for. He’s done a lot,” the Republican governor said, adding that he was praying for Kirk.
Charlie Kirk dies after shooting at Utah Valley University

“What happened today was not just an attack on Charlie personally, but, really an attack on the idea that we resolve these things through reason, debate, and elections,” DeSantis said.
President Donald Trump announced Wednesday afternoon that Kirk had died.
Attorney General James Uthmeier, a Republican, said in a social media post, “Leftist violence is out of control,” adding that he and his wife were praying for “one of the greatest conservative leaders of our generation.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott expressed dismay.

Republican U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody said her office was monitoring the situation and that she was praying “for Charlie Kirk, the students, and this nation.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna credited Kirk for inspiring her involvement in poilitics.

Republican Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson said in a social media post that he was praying for Kirk and his family, as did Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez.
“Charlie Kirk is a remarkable and genuine voice for the conservative movement. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family after this senseless shooting,” Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia posted to social media.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson said she was “horrified” and that “Political violence is never the answer and my prayers are with him.”

“This is a human being — a young father and husband. Charlie challenged us to engage in civil discourse, not violence. Everyone’s hearts should be broken right now for this beautiful family,” Florida Sen. Danny Burgess (R-Zephyrhills) posted to social media.
U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican candidate for governor, called Kirk “an American Patriot” in a social media post. “He did not deserve this heinous act. NOBODY DOES. Pray for Charlie.”
Republican candidate for governor and former House Speaker Paul Renner said, “Charlie was taken from us by a sick and deranged act of political violence,” in a social media post.
“The world stops when we hear of political violence. And it should. Prayers for Charlie Kirk right now, for our nation, and for our politics,” former U.S. Rep. and Democratic candidate for governor David Jolly said in a social media post.
Tuesday, the Phoenix reported on a survey finding that during the past three years, violence against campus speakers was viewed as increasingly more acceptable.
The 2025 College Free Speech Rankings produced by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression found that 34% of students nationwide consider it acceptable, at least in rare cases, to use violence to stop a campus speech. In 2024, that number was 32%; in 2023, it was 27%; in 2022, it was 20%. In 2020, 24% of students found violence acceptable at least in rare situations.

During a Florida Board of Governors meeting Wednesday in Sarasota, Education Commissioner Anastasio Kamoutsas prayed for Kirk.
“We want to pray God that his soul be resting right now, that his wife, you are there comforting her as well as his children during this incredibly difficult time,” Kamoutsas said and paused for a moment of silence.
Kirk toured the country appearing on university campuses offering debate with people. He appeared at Florida State University, University of South Florida, University of Central Florida, and the University of Florida in February.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Attorney General Gentner Drummond will allow the Oklahoma State Board of Education to hire its chosen attorney despite his doubts of the candidate’s qualifications, he said Wednesday.
“I am not in agreement with the Board’s decision on this matter,” Drummond said in a statement. “However, I respect it is their decision to make. If this is the attorney they wish to hire, then I will not interfere.”
Drummond first aired his disagreement last week after four members of the seven-seat board voted to hire Oklahoma City attorney Ryan Leonard as the board’s counsel. Leonard said last week he was “shocked and dismayed” at the criticism because until that point the Attorney General’s Office had communicated to him that Drummond was supportive of him taking on the role.
“I appreciate the Attorney General allowing me and my firm the opportunity to render this important public service for our state,” Leonard said in a statement Wednesday. “I look forward to working with the Superintendent and all of the members of the State Board of Education.”
Drummond has the authority to revoke a state board’s contract with an attorney. He said he will allow the state Board of Education to hire Leonard “for now,” but he reserves the right to cancel the contract “if circumstances justify that action.”

He revoked a lawyer’s contract with the state Board of Education once before. Last year, Drummond removed an attorney who had advised the board to block state lawmakers from attending private portions of the board’s meetings, contrary to the attorney general’s advice.
Drummond called Leonard “politically connected” but unqualified to represent a state board. 
Leonard said his firm — Leonard, Long & Cassil, PLLC — has ample experience in state government law and in representing state agencies.
State Board of Education member Mike Tinney, also an attorney, said he believed Leonard is “very qualified” for the position. State Superintendent Ryan Walters didn’t attend the board meeting last week, but he issued a statement afterward saying he was “pleased to welcome Ryan Leonard to the team.” 
Leonard previously served as special counsel for Native American affairs for Gov. Kevin Stitt, of whom Drummond is a frequent critic. Drummond is a Republican candidate running to succeed Stitt as governor.
“While I have no issues with Ryan Leonard personally, it is clear he does not have the proper experience to serve as general counsel to the most significant governing board in the State of Oklahoma,” Drummond said. “You wouldn’t hire a divorce attorney to sue your insurance company, and you wouldn’t hire a DUI lawyer to handle an adoption. Mr. Leonard does not have the right legal experience to do this job, but he certainly has the right political connections.”

Prosecutors oppose a delay, contending that Serhat Gumrukcu faces a mandatory life-in-prison sentence and any additional time to prepare for the hearing won’t change that.

The attorney for a former California man convicted of charges in a plot to kill a business partner in Vermont is asking a judge to delay his sentencing where he faces a mandatory sentence of life behind bars.
Prosecutors responded in their own filing that the hearing should go forward as scheduled.
Serhat Gumrukcu, 42, is set to be sentenced later this month in federal court in Burlington after a jury returned guilty verdicts against him in April for offenses including murder for hire, conspiracy to commit murder for hire and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
The case against Gumrukcu stems from the fatal shooting of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville. According to prosecutors, Gumrukcu ordered and paid for Davis to be killed over a failed oil trading deal between the two men. 
Susan Marcus, Gumrukcu’s attorney, filed a motion Wednesday morning seeking to delay that sentencing for at least 60 days.

Marcus wrote that a draft presentence report prepared by federal probation officers has raised issues that she wanted to address before her client’s sentencing.
While Gumrukcu faces a mandatory life sentence, Marcus wrote in the filing, “nonetheless issues like the amount of a fine, restitution, as well as factual assertions that we dispute are relevant to sentencing and warrant a response from Serhat Gumrukcu.”
Prosecutors, in a response filed later Wednesday afternoon, wrote that a delay was not warranted. 
“This Court must sentence the defendant to life,” the filing stated. “Sentencing is therefore not complex.”
The prosecution filing also included a statement from Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ widow. She wrote about the impact a delay would have on her and her family.
“For seven long years we have prayed and waited for justice in the death of my husband. We are deeply grateful for the jury’s verdict earlier this year, which finally brought us a measure of justice and peace,” Melissa Davis wrote.
“Your Honor, each postponement reopens wounds that have struggled to heal. We have endured years of extensions and delays with patience and grace, but the weight has been heavy,” Melissa Davis added. “My children and I long to take the next step forward in our lives, and that step cannot fully come until this process is complete.”  
Judge Christina Reiss, who has presided over the case, had not issued a ruling by late Wednesday afternoon.
Gumrukcu led the murder-to-hire plot to kill Davis over fears that the Vermont man was going to go to authorities and accuse him of fraud in a business deal between them regarding oil trading that had been ongoing for months. 
That would, prosecutors said during the trial, possibly have hindered a larger business deal Gumrukcu had in the works with a biomedical company with millions of dollars at stake. 
Gumrukcu was a Turkish national with permanent U.S. residency status at the time of Davis’ killing. Davis, who was 49 at the time of his death, was living in Vermont with his wife and six children, with a seventh on the way.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/10/ct-credit-ratings-lamont/,"The upgrades by Moody’s and Fitch are likely campaign fodder for Gov. Ned Lamont, who is widely expected to announce a bid for a third term.","Connecticut continues to earn higher marks from Wall Street credit ratings agencies, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday, hailing the latest upgrades as further evidence that his administration has reversed the state’s once-floundering fiscal outlook.
The upgrades by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch ratings and the improved pension fund performance also are likely campaign fodder for a Democratic governor widely expected to announce a bid for a third term soon.
“Let there be no doubt that Connecticut is back,” said Lamont, who joined Treasurer Erick Russell at the Capitol to outline how the state has doubled its pension assets in the past decade. “This is the result of sound fiscal management, a growing trust in Connecticut by businesses and residents, which is reflected in our improved economic statistics, and a historic run in the stock market.”
Connecticut failed to save adequately for more than seven decades prior to 2011 for pensions promised to retired state workers and teachers. By failing to do so, it effectively forfeited billions of dollars in potential investment earnings, leaving future generations of taxpayers to cover these obligations.
This mounting debt, in turn, drove up minimum required payments the state had to make annually to these retirement programs in the 2000s and 2010s, a trend that contributed to major state tax hikes in 2009, 2011 and 2015 while still leeching resources away from education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
Connecticut’s fortunes started to shift in 2011 when then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy closed loopholes that had allowed the state to short-change its pensions for decades. Malloy also twice secured major benefit concessions from state employee unions.
And in 2017, legislators from both parties adopted controversial budget caps that have forced huge annual savings. Since 2020, the state has dedicated more than $8.5 billion in surplus to its pensions and could deposit nearly $2 billion more later this fall. Those payments, coupled with a robust stock market and improved state investment policies, leave Connecticut with roughly $63 billion in assets for its pensions for retired state employees and municipal teachers.
“If we continue the progress we have made, the state’s pension debt … will be fully funded within a generation,” the governor said. “This is the legacy we are leaving our children and grandchildren and one we should all be proud to reach.”
Moody’s elevated Connecticut’s score from Aa3 to Aa2. The “Aa” ratings bracket is Moody’s second-highest and is reserved for states and other entities whose bond offerings are “of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.”
Similarly, Fitch upgraded Connecticut from AA- to AA.  For Fitch, “AA” is its second-highest ratings tier and is reserved for bond offerings “of very low default risk.”
The immediate impact of these upgrades should be lower interest rates for a state that borrows billions of dollars annually to build and renovate local schools, replace its aging transportation infrastructure and finance numerous capital projects at public colleges and universities.
But Russell said the upgrades mean much more than that.
Cheaper borrowing costs and minimum pension contributions that aren’t surging dramatically year after year “is going to allow us to … make really critical investments in education and in child care and [build] on so much of the work that has been done under the governor and the legislature’s leadership,” Russell said.
Required pension contributions this fiscal year will gobble up $3.4 billion of the budget’s General Fund, about $250 million more than last year. But that obligation would have grown by about $980 million had Connecticut not been pouring surplus into pensions since 2020.
“That’s money we can use to invest in our future, and/or cut taxes, both of which we have done,” Lamont added.
But many of the governor’s fellow Democrats, and other critics, say that’s not a fair description of the process.
The budget caps that generate huge annual surpluses are doing much more harm to education, municipal aid, and other core programs than any benefit these services are receiving from the limited growth in mandatory pension payments, they say.
State budget surpluses, since 2017, have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year, or more than 8% of the General Fund.
Many Democratic legislators have called over the past year for Connecticut to scale back savings efforts, arguing even a modest adjustment still would allow the state to attack pension debt while also preserving core programs.
Democratic legislative leaders were forced this spring to scrap plans for a state income tax credit for middle-class families with children and dramatically scale back new investments in Medicaid rates for doctors who accept low-income patients. Connecticut hadn’t adjusted its rates in broad-based fashion since 2007, leaving many patients unable to find doctors willing to treat them.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign in March attacking Lamont. Though grants to towns, on paper, have risen since he took office in 2019, CCM estimates education funding alone, once adjusted for inflation, has declined by more than $400 million.
Republican legislators have praised Connecticut’s efforts to reduce pension debt.
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford said “the governor and Democrats [also] have made strides to undermine the money that has been paid into pensions.”
The GOP has criticized Lamont for allowing too many accounting gimmicks and other maneuvers to work around budget caps to accommodate frustrated Democrats.
The administration agreed in June to move $350 million outside of the traditional budget to finance a major expansion in child care service by the early 2030s.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — A wildland firefighter told Kentucky lawmakers Wednesday that firefighters the state dispatches to control wildfires are grappling with low pay and a high turnover rate that heightens the dangers of their already hazardous work. 
Zoe Treibitz, who said she worked as an emergency wildland firefighter in the Kentucky Division of Forestry’s office in Hazard, told the state legislature’s Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force that chronic understaffing among wildland firefighters is putting communities at risk. 
“This job is a calling. It’s hard, dangerous and demanding, but it’s also meaningful,” Treibitz said. “But every year, emergency firefighters are forced to leave the work they love not because they want to, but because they simply cannot afford to stay.” 
Treibitz, 24, said the Division of Forestry has full-time staff and seasonal firefighters to control wildfires, but many of the firefighters on the ground are hired on an on-call “emergency” basis. These emergency firefighters, Treibitz said, work at various times throughout the year depending on fire activity. 
Treibitz said during an active fire season, workdays for emergency wildland firefighters can stretch over 12 hours multiple days in a row. She said firefighters are often breathing in smoke, traversing cliffs and managing rapidly shifting fire lines. Treibitz said her former colleagues deal with chronic fatigue and muscle strains, and she personally dealt with weeks of painful blisters on her heels at one point. 
She said people who dismiss wildland firefighting as “unskilled labor” are wrong.
“Our jobs require us to be part meteorologist, part topographer, part biologist, constantly reading the land, the weather, the fuel, to predict how a fire will move,” Treibitz said. “These are not skills you can pick up overnight. They come through rigorous training and on-the-ground-boots experience.” 
The pay for those long days is low. An anonymous letter sent in June to the task force, written by a group claiming to represent emergency wildland firefighters, stated their current wage is $12 an hour. The letter also called on lawmakers to establish a way for emergency firefighters to accrue sick leave and paid time off and criticized a lack of training provided for firefighters. Data from the state’s online portal that displays salaries of state employees suggests emergency wildland firefighters make $12 an hour, while seasonal wildland firefighters can make more. 
Treibitz, who told the Lantern she was part of the group that wrote the letter, urged lawmakers to increase the pay to $17 an hour, comparable with other states, in next year’s legislative session when a new two-year state budget will be crafted. Treibitz said she recently left her job as an emergency wildland firefighter in part because of low pay and other concerns expressed in the June letter. She said Rep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, invited her to speak before the task force after the letter was sent. 
Sen. Robin Webb, R-Grayson, who has been in the legislature since 1999, said she appreciated Treibitz’ testimony and that state forestry work has historically been “grossly underfunded and sometimes the first thing to be cut in budget cycles.” 
A spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, which houses the Division of Forestry, did not immediately provide a response Wednesday afternoon to questions about the anonymous letter and Treibitz’ testimony.

Wildland firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service have also criticized low pay and arduous work schedules with some firefighters quitting because of the poor working conditions. 
Hart, the state representative and a retired lieutenant with the Lexington Fire Department, proposed lawmakers consider creating a statewide program to coordinate wildland firefighting resources similar to a statewide program coordinating search and rescue resources. He said most fire departments in the state focus training on structure fires “because that’s what they see all the time.” 
“We don’t have the ability to really hone in our skills on wildfire firefighting like we should,” Hart said. “They are a very specialized skill set, and I’m telling you from experience because I’ve been on some of these forest fires in our state.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1991_smaller-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

“I look at this as like a crisis that they're facing,” the Republican governor said Wednesday.

MONTPELIER — Gov. Phil Scott said his administration plans to present a slate of recommendations to Burlington leaders in the coming weeks to address what he called a “crisis” related to homelessness and public drug use in the state’s largest city.
Scott’s comments, during a press conference Wednesday, come several weeks after Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak charged that the governor was not doing enough to help her city, or other municipalities around Vermont, respond to persistent social and economic challenges that have garnered significant statewide attention.
At the same time, Scott and leaders from his administration argued that the city isn’t doing enough on its own to enforce existing laws, including cracking down on illegal drug use and drug dealing as well as property crimes. A man’s death last month after he was assaulted near downtown’s City Hall Park has also inflamed local safety concerns.
“I look at this as like a crisis that they’re facing, much like a flood,” Scott told reporters, speaking in response to a question about the city’s economic vitality. “And the first thing that we need to do is respond to the flooding and help people — and then, the recovery part after. So, it’ll be a two-step process.”
The Republican governor said he met with a group of Burlington business owners Tuesday and plans to meet soon with residents and academic leaders, all of which would inform his recommendations. He would not share any specific policy changes he might propose. Scott said his administration would present its plan to Mulvaney-Stanak, who’s a Progressive, as well as the Democratic-controlled Burlington City Council.

Late last month, the council overwhelmingly passed a resolution aimed at barring people from camping overnight in City Hall Park — something that is not allowed under local ordinances but has nevertheless become commonplace — and bolstering the presence of law enforcement officers in the area, among other measures. 
In the park, which is located just off the Church Street shopping hub, “acts of violence, drug trafficking, open drug use, the fencing of stolen goods, disorderly conduct, unlawful mischief, and similarly unacceptable incidents are far too commonplace,” the council resolution states.
Scott’s press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said in an email Wednesday afternoon that the governor’s plan would focus on “public safety, holding service-resistant repeat offenders accountable, and connecting those in need of treatment to services.”
City leaders have not explicitly asked Scott to make policy recommendations, the governor said. But he contended that his goal was not to impose changes on the city that it would not want.
“We’re not going to force ourselves onto the city much like we’re seeing across the country with the current administration in Washington. That’s not our role,” Scott said. “If the city would like our help, we would lay out a plan to let them know what we can provide, and what we can’t.”
Mulvaney-Stanak wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon that she was “pleased to hear” the governor and his administration were considering ways to help Burlington.
The city is developing a list of specific requests for the state government that it believes would complement efforts already underway locally to address health and safety challenges, the mayor wrote. Her office is doing its own outreach to community members as part of that process, too.
“I look forward to meeting with the Governor to discuss our respective ideas and identify areas for deeper collaboration and coordination on both immediate and longer term solutions,” the mayor wrote.

She joined 3,200 other union members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who went on strike at midnight on Aug. 4 to get better wages and retirement plans (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).The 3,200 Boeing mechanics and workers who have been on strike at Missouri and Illinois locations since August will vote on a new settlement agreement on Friday. 
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced Wednesday a union negotiating committee had reached a tentative agreement with Boeing Defense.
“The five-year tentative agreement includes improvements to general wage increases and restores a signing bonus,” the union said in a prepared statement.  “IAM union members will be provided with more information soon.”
Union workers walked out from their jobs at Boeing’s three facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill., on Aug. 4 after members rejected a four-year labor agreement. 
According to a union statement announcing the strike, its members “assemble and maintain advanced aircraft and weapons systems, including the F-15, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies.”
One of the union’s biggest complaints was the pay progression to get to top-scale pay is much slower than other Boeing sites and other aerospace manufacturers. The union was looking to decrease the amount of time, which is called auto progression, in the new contract, Chad Stevenson, a plant chairman for the union at the St. Louis facility, said in August. 
He said the original offer wouldn’t equally benefit the longtime workers who endured pay freezes when the company’s contracts were “lean” over the last several years.
“Our members took concessions to help this company and continued to produce the same amount and the same quality of work,” said Stevenson, who works as an assembly mechanic. “So really it was over eight years, top-scale wasn’t raised. And we’re ready for them to make a competitive, fair offer in these negotiations and take it back before membership and let them decide again.”
In reaction to the details of the new offer, Stevenson said Wednesday that he wants union members to make a “collective decision, and I hope that we have a good showing at the vote, and there’s a good representation of what our membership wants.”
Boeing posted some key points of the agreement on its website Wednesday.
“Thanks to guaranteed wage increases, increased auto progression, and new progression opportunities, our team could earn up to 45% more on average by the end of this contract,” the website states. 
It also states that employees in progression represent 78% of the team and have the potential to see “their hourly wages grow even higher than 45% by leveraging the new pay enhancements.”
Last week, Boeing announced it would be hiring permanent replacement workers for the empty position. 
“If a job has been permanently replaced, there may not be a role to return to immediately,” the website states. “If a role is not immediately available, they will be added to a recall list until a position for which they are qualified becomes available.”
However, some workers told St. Louis Public Radio that Boeing already struggled to hire skilled workers before the strike began.
IAM Union members at Boeing Defense will vote on the tentative agreement Friday morning at the St. Louis Music Park in Maryland Heights. If the contract is ratified, striking employees will be required to return to work on Monday at 11 p.m.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2949-scaled-e1757539013206-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

Lisa Murkowski speaks on Election Day on Nov. 8, 2022 at a press conference held at her campaign headquarters in Anchorage. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Since January, I have called U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski’s office regularly to express my concerns about the GOP agenda, because I thought she was a moderate Republican open to input. I held out hope she might leave her party and stand up for all Alaskans and Americans. However, her deciding vote on H.R.-1, the “Big Ugly Bill” made me realize my calls to her office were pointless.
First and foremost, Sen. Murkowski is not a moderate Republican. She, like her Alaskan colleagues in Congress, are millionaires voting for their own interests. It seems there are no moderate Republicans left in Congress. The overtime and tip tax breaks that could help millions of everyday Americans are extremely restricted and sunset in 2028. Meanwhile, the tax breaks for millionaires are permanent.
Second, I do not believe Sen. Murkowski agonized over the vote. Murkowski has been adept at finding a nuanced political position over the years, one that allows her to appear independent while never actually derailing the GOP agenda. Murkowski had the opportunity to truly be an independent voice for all of America, like John McCain’s famous thumbs down vote against repealing Obamacare. Instead, she made a big political show, maintained her facade of the contrarian, and voted in line with Trump because she is afraid of retaliation.
Finally, there is a cognitive dissonance in her vote that cannot be explained away by a few Alaska specific add-ons. Murkowski has made comments critical of Trump’s immigration policies such as when fellow U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, D-California was forcibly removed from a press conference, tackled to the ground, and detained. Yet she voted to increase the ICE operating budget by  hundreds of million dollars. Murkowski has consistently said she “strongly supports women’s reproductive freedoms” in opposition to many of her GOP colleagues, yet her vote on this bill stripped funding from Planned Parenthood. She said she was considering leaving the GOP to become an Independent, but she voted in line with the GOP. Her actions do not support her statements. The only logical conclusion therefore is that Sen. Murkowski is lying to Alaska. If she actually believes these claims then she is lying to herself, and that is the true hallmark of a MAGA Republican.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC02606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

“Polished videos are nice, but how ‘bout a real conversation?,” the state employees’ union president posed to Scott in a video of her own.

In an appeal to state workers, Gov. Phil Scott released a video statement this week explaining his decision to institute a three-days-per-week return to office across state government. 
“Vermonters want and need to access their government. They need to see us in their communities. They need to know where and how we work,” he said, recording from his office desk. “Most importantly, they want and need us to be good stewards of their tax dollars.”
For its part, the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, has strongly opposed the move, and its president released a video of her own in response. 
“You have excluded us from the conversation. You have shut us out of your secret committee that is meeting to work on a policy that will have devastating impacts on the delivery of vital services,” Aimee Bertrand said in her video message, referencing a cross-agency group Scott had empowered to plan the logistics of the switch. She recorded from her kitchen, where she said she works remotely every day. 


The dueling videos reveal the high stakes of the new policy decision, which sent shockwaves across state government when Scott first announced his intention last month. Starting Dec. 1, state employees will be expected to work from their offices at least three days per week, a pivot for many who have grown accustomed to almost total flexibility to work from home. 
Scott and his top deputies have said the decision is driven by a need to increase collaboration and transparency both between workers and with the public. The employees’ union has criticized the policy as arbitrary and running contrary to Vermont data indicating state employees highly value remote work and believe it positively impacts productivity. 
Addressing state workers directly in a video was a rare step for Scott, who used the speech to stress that his choice was not a slight at the quality or commitment of Vermont’s workforce. He also noted that many state workers haven’t been able to work remotely at all.  
“One of the things I’m most proud of as governor is the silos we’ve broken down between agencies and departments,” he said in his video statement released Monday. “But we’ve lost some of that camaraderie and collaboration because we don’t see each other in person.”


On Tuesday, Bertrand turned up the pressure, accusing Scott of “attempting to divide state workers and pit them against each other.”
She argued employees are safer when they don’t have to drive through storms or work in “poorly secured” state buildings, and that less travel time was an environmentally conscious decision. 
“Polished videos are nice, but how ‘bout a real conversation?” Bertrand posed to Scott.  
Scott’s administration has the power to alter employee telework agreements with two weeks notice, far less than the three month timeline laid out. Still, the three-month turnaround is a daunting logistical feat and questions linger about its rollout. Sarah Clark, Vermont’s administration secretary, said Wednesday that the hybrid return-to-office plan is taking up 99% of her focus. 
Across the country, both private business and the public sector have grappled with bringing employees back to the office since Covid-19 brought a halt to some in-person work. In many states, governors’ efforts to bring back state workers, either part-time or full-time, have  been met with aggressive union opposition — and mixed results. 
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott first sought to end telework but then signed legislation bringing back the option. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the state governor’s return to work order after a state employees’ union challenged it. And in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has pushed for four days in office, his administration cut deals with employees’ unions to limit the mandate in exchange for salary concessions.

Simply put, “The Play That Goes Wrong” does, in so many ways, as a troupe of actors do their disastrous darnedest to get through the  mishap-prone opening night of a 1920s whodunit.
That makes it the perfect introduction for this milestone anniversary season, said New Stage Artistic Director Francine Thomas Reynolds. “I think you have to go with anything that happens, right?”
The show-must-go-on drive has seen the regional professional theater through a storied history that has launched careers, built a reliable stable of talent, supported new works and brought rich Mississippi stories, American classics and powerful contemporary fare to the Jackson stage.

From the start, the founders’ commitment reached beyond entertainment. They wanted something different, hence the “New Stage” name. Desegregating the stage and the audience in civil rights era Mississippi brought called-in threats, Reynolds said, recalling conversations with founding Artistic Director Ivan Rider. 
“Doing things like ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ as their first show — it was very bold. … They kept going. They did it.” 
Subsequent hurdles included a financial crisis that nearly closed the theater in 2001, but New Stage powered through with an “intermission” season, skeleton staff and volunteers, and rebuilt. The COVID-19 pandemic brought another huge challenge. 
“While theaters were closing or pausing around the country, we pivoted,” said Sharon Miles, former New Stage education director, frequent performer and, later this season, a guest director. Virtual play readings, streamed shows and an online summer camp met the moment.  
“That type of resilience says so much about who we are as artists, as a theater, as a community, and I won’t ever forget that,” she said.
“I think after 60 years, a lot does go wrong, that you make right,” Reynolds said, from problem-solving design challenges to keeping the lights on (or rehearsing in the back alley when Katrina knocks them out). “That’s part of the magic of theater, and how you make it happen and how you persevere.”
A milestone season brings into focus what the theater has gotten right all along. That perseverance and its legacy have a generational impact. Starkville native Miles was a 9th grader when she saw a production of August Wilson’s “Fences” at New Stage Theatre. 
“It was the first time I had ever seen an all-Black cast. It was a turning point in my life, because I did not know you could make a career in theater before that moment.” 
Miles just completed her master of fine arts degree in acting at Northwestern University in Chicago. She returns to New Stage in February to direct the Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Primary Trust” by Eboni Booth, part of the anniversary season’s main stage lineup.
Award-winning Atlanta-based playwright Topher Payne is among many who can claim New Stage as a launchpad. 
“I’m so fortunate that that was where, as a teenager, I learned what I had a right to expect in a professional theater environment, which was so driven by people first, product second,” said Payne, who came onboard as an apprentice almost 30 years ago. 
“From (founder) Jane Reid Petty forward, it was always with the goal of creating a space where community can gather. And, that wasn’t just what we’re offering the audience. It’s what we’re offering as artists, to each other,” Payne said. “For me, as a 17-year-old artsy kid from Kosciusko, that was my safe space. … It was safe for me to be joyful. It was safe for me to be brave and bold and make mistakes, and have the support of the community. That still propels me forward and expects me to do the same for others.” 
He worked that theater know-how into a professional career that has taken him all over the world. It pulls him back to Mississippi in April, when he’ll direct his new play “The Attala County Garden Club,” a contemporary Southern comedy Payne described as “a little bit ‘Witches of Eastwick’ … a little bit ‘Get Out.’” 
“It’s a story for everybody who ever thought they wanted to fit in, and then have to deal with what happens when they do,” he said.
Veteran New Stage actor Jo Ann Robinson’s show count hovers around 58, and she’ll notch another in Payne’s play next spring. The theater’s faithful core group of Mississippi-based performers and crew who return, show after show, bring the skill and dedication artistic directors can rely on, she said. 


“They’re responsible, they show up when they’re supposed to, and they’re easy to work with. … That makes it better for everyone.
“The people behind the scenes, the crews, the designers, the people in administration, the actors that work there consistently — it’s like home to us,” Robinson said. “That does set it apart.”
That care runs deep. This week, New Stage unveils the honorary renaming of the Belhaven block bound by Carlisle, Whitworth, Fortification and Monroe streets to Bill McCarty Square. The move celebrates Bill McCarty III’s roles as passionate New Stage volunteer for more than 50 years, generous donor and, for the past 24 years without compensation, the theater’s general manager.
Jackson actor John Howell, an intern in 1993 and briefly education director, adds to his frequent onstage work in “The Play That Goes Wrong,” as the earnest actor playing the butler. Fondren Theatre Workshop, started by Howell and his wife, Diana, in 2003, partners with New Stage to present John Maxwell’s play “We Need to Talk” at the New Stage’s Warehouse Theatre in November.
Now retired from teaching, Howell highlighted the key role of training at New Stage. 
“There are so many opportunities for young people, starting with kids, starting with the camps and the classes. So many people who are onstage now started out back then, as kids,” he said, noting, too, its extraordinary opportunities for associates (formerly called interns) for professional training. “They basically create their own season in the Unframed Series, in addition to all the touring and the support they give to the main shows.
“New Stage is a really great laboratory for learning about the art of theater, for all ages, for all skill levels, and for all types of interests,” Howell said.
That’s intentional. 
“When we hire people, we spend a lot of time making sure that they have a good foundation for more work,” Reynolds added.

Miles called it “a garden of fertile ground for artists. It’s a place where local talent can grow — whether you’re acting, directing or working in design.” Fruits from her New Stage time include character and community building, and the importance of costume checks. 
One night, playing the star’s best friend in “Mahalia: A Gospel Musical,” her usually meticulous check proved not good enough. 
“I’m supposed to be driving this car and we’re supposed to take off really, really fast. … So, I speed off, I throw my head back and my wig comes off onstage! I’m completely frozen. I don’t know what to do, and Mahalia looks at me and says, ‘Didn’t put that wig on too tight, did you?’”
They laughed and so did the audience, who probably never knew it was a flub. Miles chuckled.
“I check my wigs very securely now.”
Reynolds’ own New Stage roots reach back to 1989 with a “Steel Magnolias” role, followed by day camp leadership and education director, and acting and guest directing till 1995. She came back in 2006 to restart the day camp, was kept on to plan the main stage season and hired as artistic director in 2007. 
A thread throughout the theater’s history is a focus on good scripts. 
“This is one thing I always remember about Jane,” Reynolds said of New Stage Theatre founder Petty’s constant eye on well-written scripts. “She would say that, and I always kept that in my head.”
Mississippi stories, written by Mississippians and/or dealing with the state’s culture, icons and history, are another key thread. Plays by Eudora Welty, Beth Henley and Tennessee Williams, certainly, graced the stage, and so have works by Payne, Maxwell and Randy Redd, adaptations of books by John Grisham and Jill Conner Browne, plays about or including Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Bobby Rush, productions tapping into state history with the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Fannie Lou Hamer, Freedom Riders,  the murder of Emmett Till and more.
About 70% of the actors onstage are Mississippians. 
“I think it’s real important to be within the community, and build community,” Reynolds said. “Theater has the agency to build community more than a lot of things.”
 She sees it in the summer day camps. 
“I say all the time, ‘If politicians would do day camp, everything would be better.’ People from all walks of life — private and public school, different districts, different counties — come together and have a good time and solve problems and collaborate.” 
In 2017, New Stage initiated the Mississippi Plays Series as part of its Eudora Welty New Play Series, partly because certain plays and stories told about Mississippi did not get it right, Reynolds said. 
“I thought it was real important that we pay attention to the stories that are being told about Mississippi, and try to contribute to that.”
When it comes to the “magic” of theater, the production team has conjured some gasp-worthy moments over the years. The train in “Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express” (2019-20 season, Scenic Designer Dex Edwards), complete with moving cars onstage, was a particular standout that amazed even a seasoned pro. 
Maxwell, also a former artistic director as well as longtime actor, sat behind Technical Director Richard Lawrence in the audience one night, and murmured praise the first time the train’s dining car moved to the sleeper car, Lawrence said.  
“Then it moved again in the same direction … and he leaned over and goes, ‘I know how big this theater is, where the hell is that train going?’” When the train split for the caboose to come downstage, a string of “Omigods” summed up the wonder. 
“The train was the very first time I ever got applause for a set,” Lawrence said.
Another high point was the truck in “The Grapes of Wrath,” (2013-14 season, also designed by Edwards). Packing up the house, the family stacked items on the table which then turned around to reveal the truck it had become — a washboard as radiator, pots for headlights, washtubs for wheels. Built on a small turntable on a slipstage, it was able to turn and drive across the stage. 
“That was, to me, pretty ding-dang cool,” Lawrence said.
Onstage rain in several productions and a moment in “The Sound of Music,” when the whole villa moved downstage (to applause from wowed viewers) were other high points.
“One of the things New Stage does well, and it’s partly because of you,” Reynolds said to Lawrence, “is that we are able to look good on a small budget.”
Lawrence nodded. “That’s the miracle, every time.”

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Senate Republicans met behind closed doors on Wednesday at the Indiana Statehouse roughly three weeks after their House counterparts to discuss redistricting, though none shared specifics with media following the caucus.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who leads the Republican body, declined to comment as he left the Senate caucus room.
Also on Wednesday, a national poll found that most Republicans want to ban mid-decade redistricting even as a group sends texts encouraging Hoosiers to support the move.

The two-hour meeting follows a Washington D.C. trip last month where Bray and House Speaker Todd Huston met personally with President Donald Trump to discuss redistricting. Trump and his allies have identified Indiana as an opportunity to grow the slim Republican majority in Congress.
Just two of Indiana’s nine congressional districts are held by Democrats, limiting pick-up opportunities. But with Republican supermajorities in both chambers, and a GOP governor, there’s little opponents can do to halt the process.
Despite the pressure, Indiana’s leaders haven’t yet scheduled a special session and the vast majority of Republican lawmakers have been silent on the issue. Several other senators leaving Wednesday’s meeting also declined to comment or share their perspective — though both Sens. Spencer Deery and Greg Walker have been vocal about their opposition.
The state’s entire Republican delegation in the U.S. House has come out in favor of redistricting, though doing so will shift the boundary lines of their districts. Congressional representatives aren’t required to live in the area they serve.
Members of the House Republican caucus are set to meet Friday.
 Pro-redistricting texts

Texts sent by the conservative-leaning Forward America started showing back up Tuesday — urging Hoosiers to contact their local representative to support redistricting. 
“Radical progressives like Gavin Newsom, J.B. Pritzker, and Kathy Hochul are plotting to stop President Trump’s agenda by redistricting their states and wiping out the conservative majority in Congress. Our state legislators have the power to counter the radical progressives’ power grab by doing our own redistricting here in Indiana,” one message read.
The U.S. Constitution requires a count of “all persons” every 10 years. 
Poll: Most Hoosiers oppose mid-decade redistricting, want focus on daily challenges

So far, the only state that has redistricted off-cycle is Texas, a Republican state. Another red state, Missouri, is in the middle of a special session doing the same. 
Forward America was also responsible for robocalls to Hoosiers last month — resulting in several complaints to the Attorney General’s Office. That office didn’t return a request seeking an update. 
The group is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a 501c4 nonprofit out of Alexandria, Virginia. The principal officer is Blaise Hazelwood, a Republican strategist and consultant. 
Forward America has been around since at least 2019 and reported gross receipts of less than $50,000 for the 2024 tax period. It doesn’t have to make public its donors, which is why some refer to it as dark money.
Hazelwood is the owner of Grassroots Targeting LLC — a microtargeting company that tailors messages to certain voters.  
She served as the Republican National Committee’s political director in 2002 and 2004 and spearheaded the development of Voter Vault, the first online national voter file, her company bio said. 
Hazelwood launched Grassroots in 2005 to “provide accurate and actionable data — modeling every precinct in the nation.” The firm has consulted on winning presidential, senatorial and congressional campaigns as well as 19 governors. 
Hazelwood did not return a call seeking comment from the Capital Chronicle.
 A poll against redistricting

The same day as the GOP caucus, voting rights advocate Common Cause released a poll reporting that 64% of Republican and independent voters want to ban mid-decade redistricting. 
Common Cause commissioned Noble Predictive Insights to conduct the poll between Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. It surveyed more than 2,000 registered voters nationally and an additional 400 to 500 registered voters in Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois and California.

“In very clear terms, our poll shows even Republicans in red states like Indiana don’t want mid-decade redistricting,” said Julia Vaughn, the executive director of Common Cause Indiana. “But this White House is insistent on trying to twist the arms of Indiana lawmakers. We urge lawmakers in Indiana and Washington to follow the data and put an end to gerrymandering once and for all.” 
Additionally, the poll found that the majority of voters in each state supported independent commissions to draw district boundaries, rather than state lawmakers. Sixty percent of voters who supported Trump in 2024 reportedly want Congress to ban mid-decade redistricting.
A left-leaning pollster last month similarly concluded that the majority of Hoosiers, or 52%, opposed redrawing maps. Traditionally, districts are redrawn following the once-in-a-decade census. The state’s current maps were drawn in 2021.

States Newsroom file photoRepublican Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Wednesday he is launching a task force to provide recommendations and strategies for Montana to unleash American-made energy.
A press release from the Governor’s Office said Department of Environmental Quality director Sonja Nowakowski will chair the task force and Gianforte will appoint members of the task force “in the coming days,” with its first meeting planned for Sept. 22.
With increasing demand on our energy grid, we must meet the challenge head-on to ensure affordable, reliable power for Montanans now and into the future,” Gianforte said in a statement. “After four years of failed Biden energy policies that drove up energy costs, we need innovative ideas to unleash American-made energy in our state. Montana is ready to lead, and this task force will build on our natural strengths as a state rich in energy resources.”
The task force  is charged with providing shot- and long-term recommendations and strategies for the state to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy options.
In the executive order establishing the task force, Gianforte emphasizes that Montana follows an “all-of-the-above approach to energy, supporting the expansion of energy production in every sector and avoiding market distortions by not picking winners and losers.”
Gianforte cited a report from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council that says electricity demand in the western states is expected to grow 20% during the next decade, a growth rate almost twice what was forecast in 2022. It is also four times the historical growth rate from 2013 and 2022.
Montana has historically been a net exporter of electricity, but that shifted in recent years. In 2023, NorthWestern Energy noted in its annual report that the monopoly energy company is “predominantly a net importer, especially during peak demand.”
Gianforte’s executive order highlights the state’s diverse energy portfolio, which includes coal, oil, natural gas, hydropower, wind and solar.
Roughly 37% of Montana’s in-state electricity production is generated from coal-fired power plants, while 57% is generated from renewable energy sources — primarily hydropower — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Gianforte has repeatedly stated that Montana stands ready to help President Donald Trump’s efforts towards unleashing America’s energy resources.
In his first days back in office, Trump declared a “national energy emergency” which he partially defined as an inadequate energy supply and infrastructure which led to high prices.
Both the nation, and Montana, have reached all-time energy production numbers in recent years. The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. production from all sources reached consecutive all-time highs in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
Montana Electric Power Generating Capacity by Fuel Type, 1970-2024 (Total MW Capacity)Chart by DEQ.
In Montana, DEQ data mirrors that with the state reaching its highest electric power generating capacity in 2024.
The increase in capacity over the last decade is primarily due to additional wind power, which makes up 27% of the state’s electricity capacity. Coal capacity makes up roughly 23%, natural gas 8% and solar 3%, according to DEQ.
“Montana has a long history of responsible energy development,” Nowakowski said. “As we face growing demand for electricity, it’s time to build on that legacy with innovation and investment in energy resources. This task force will convene leaders in Montana’s energy sector to identify the barriers and develop a strategy to deliver affordable, dependable energy for Montana families and the businesses ready to invest in our state.”
A recent vote by the U.S. House overturned a Biden-era resource management plan which blocked new coal leases on millions of acres of land across eastern Montana, including the Powder River Basin, which contains close to a third of the nation’s accessible coal reserves.
In a letter sent to the Trump administration, Gov. Greg Gianforte urged the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana, including by reopening Bureau of Land Management acreage to coal leases, to benefit national security, provide reliable energy and boost Montana’s educational systems.
The governor’s office stated that while the governor’s task force may recommend any strategy increase the supply of affordable, reliable energy, Gianforte expressly asked the task force to “provide recommendations that provide Montana energy producers and consumers with greater certainty in the market, stable delivery systems for electricity, efficient permitting and regulatory systems, and an end to frivolous litigation designed to delay or thwart responsible, environmentally-sound energy development.”
Gianforte’s energy task force will hold its first meeting on Sept 22 and is expected to produce a written report with recommendation and strategies by Sept. 15, 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electricity-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 16:57:16.641437

Ned Lamont endorsed the potential state purchase of a share of the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun as a savvy investment, not a subsidy.","Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday endorsed the potential state purchase of a share of the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun as a savvy investment, not a subsidy of a franchise currently in play for a possible sale and relocation.
“Ask Mohegan Sun whether it was a good investment they made 20 years ago,” Lamont said.
The Mohegan Tribal Nation, the owner of the Mohegan Sun casino, purchased the team in 2003 and relocated it the arena in its casino complex. The tribe paid $10 million and currently is entertaining offers exceeding $300 million.
Lamont and Treasurer Erick Russell discussed the WNBA as a viable investment for a pension fund at a press conference announcing that the state pension funds are outperforming peers, with an annual return exceeding 10%.
“It’s been a very hot area,” Russell said. “This has been a big topic all around the country. We’ve seen other public pension plans that have invested in the space, particularly in women’s basketball.”
Industry newsletters and publications have been noting the interest in sports franchises as an investment over the past year, as one sports law web site reported in July.
“From Undervalued to Unstoppable: The Rise of Women’s Sports as a Prime Investment Asset,” was the headline of a story saying women’s sports are attractive for their lower entry price and high ceiling for growth in value.

House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, criticized Lamont for endorsing what Candelora called “a very high-risk investment with our pension market.” 
“In general, investing in a sports team is a very risky proposition,” Candelora said, adding that Connecticut, situated between larger media markets in New York and Boston, has a checkered past when it comes to enticing top-level sports franchises to relocate or remain here.
Nuccio praised Russell’s pension performance but argued that the pension investment should go to safer places.
Flirtations with the New England Patriots ended poorly, and the NHL’s Hartford Whalers decamped for North Carolina in 1997 after a quarter-century in Hartford.
But Lamont and Russell said the value of the investment in Connecticut Sun is tied to the steady appreciation of equity positions in franchise ownerships, regardless of their balance sheet or whether they ultimately relocate.
“We’ve got private investors in alongside of us. In fact, junior to us. They like the nature of this investment. They think it’s a really good, solid, long term return for him and for our investors,” Lamont said.

RJ May, R-West Columbia,  listens from the back of the House chamber during an organizational session on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024 at the Statehouse in Columbia, SC. (Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former state Rep. RJ May walked into federal court Wednesday with a legal motion consisting of 32 pages handwritten on the front and back of lined paper.
May, a founder of the South Carolina House’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, opted last week to defend himself against charges of distributing images and videos of children being sexually abused. That means he must prepare for his October trial from his cell at the Edgefield County jail.
He has remained there without bond since his arrest June 11. He resigned his House seat last month, amid the federal charges and an ongoing investigation into his conduct by the House Ethics Committee.
May’s former public defense attorneys are on standby to help answer legal questions, but they can’t help with the actual content of his case, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie reminded May during a half-hour hearing Wednesday morning.
May used some of that help in court Wednesday. When prosecutors used legal jargon to describe how their evidence was numbered, May told the judge his standby attorneys were explaining the numbering system to him.
He also asked Currie whether he could request a sample motion from an unrelated case to make sure his own motions were formatted correctly, which Currie approved.
To build his defense, May will go back and forth between the jail and the Office of Homeland Security in Columbia — a roughly 75-minute drive each way. The judge said he could make that trip as often as necessary.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office has set up a room with a computer displaying all the evidence against him, and May can bring bagged lunches from the jail to eat while he goes through it, prosecutor Scott Matthews said Wednesday.
May’s first trip to that room followed the hearing.
There is a “tremendous amount of data to go through” in May’s case, public defender Jenny Smith, one of May’s standby attorneys, said previously. Currie asked May to get through as much as possible ahead of a hearing on his pre-trial motions Sept. 24.
May will be able to bring documents back to his jail cell, as long as they don’t contain objectionable images, Currie said. He also has access to a tablet with the application Fastcase, a legal research system that May called the “poor man’s Westlaw,” referring to the more expensive legal research website available on state prisoners’ tablets.
Jailed suspects can also use the tablets to send messages, receive approved images and emails and make phone calls, according to the Edgefield County Sheriff’s Office. May has told relatives that he can use his tablet to listen to music or play games if he pays for them, according to messages obtained through an open records request.
May does not yet have access to the list of rules for federal criminal proceedings, he said, but Currie promised him attorneys would give that to him if the jail couldn’t.
May also can’t access the online court filing system from jail, meaning he has to visit the federal courthouse in Columbia each time he wants to file a motion, as he did Wednesday.
He will come back to court next Wednesday to file any remaining pre-trial motions and receive prosecutors’ motions, Currie said.
The motion May filed Wednesday asked Currie to throw out a search warrant used to collect cellphones, laptops, thumb drives and other electronics from his house in August 2024.
While asking for the warrant, Britton Lorenzen, a special agent for Homeland Security, told a magistrate that investigators were likely to find images or videos depicting child sexual abuse even though the tip was several months old by that point because people who collect such images don’t usually get rid of them, according to a sworn statement included with May’s motion.
During May’s June detention hearing, Lorenzen said it was “very, very common” not to find actual images and videos of child sexual abuse on a suspect’s phone or computer because of how easy it is to save media to the cloud or various apps.
May argued those statements contradicted each other, suggesting Lorenzen was lying in her statement to receive the search warrant.
Without that information, May argued, the search warrant was invalid and anything found on his devices couldn’t be used in court. Lorenzen’s assertion that people who collect child sexual abuse materials was integral to the judge issuing the warrant, and without it, the judge likely wouldn’t have signed off, May argued.
While investigators didn’t find videos or images on May’s devices, they did find other evidence linking May’s phone and laptop to a messaging account flagged for sending videos showing children being sexually abused, Lorenzen testified during his detention hearing. Data on May’s phone suggested that he had repeatedly typed “joebidennnn69,” the username of the flagged account, and that the Kik messaging app, along with several other encrypted apps, had been deleted from the device.
Investigators also tracked the IP address used to send the messages back to May’s house and personal phone, investigators said.
A hearing on that motion, along with any others filed in the coming weeks, is scheduled for Sept. 24.

A U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily pausing a series of federal policies aimed at restricting certain immigrants’ access to public benefits and programs.


California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island. 
In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.
California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve. 
In a hearing last month, Jessica Ranucci, a lawyer for the Attorney General’s Office of the State of New York, said the new policies mean that a slew of federally funded programs could all be required to verify immigration status before providing any help. Affected programs include suicide hotlines, mental health services, homeless shelters, soup kitchen, domestic violence and child abuse prevention services. Adult schools, which offer many English-language classes, and the free preschool program Head Start would also be required to deny entry to certain students. The new policies could exclude “millions of people” from “life-saving services,” said Ranucci, including U.S. citizens who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence but lack the right paperwork. 
A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies reflect the proper interpretation of federal law and that government programs should be able to easily verify legal status. 
U.S. district judge Mary McElroy disagreed and repeatedly questioned Skedzielewski in the hearing about the practicality of verifying the legal status of every participant. “How is this not a giant unfunded federal mandate to the states?” she asked, referring to the burden it would put on service providers. “What do we do with someone who is having a mental health crisis and maybe doesn’t even know their own name?” 
The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”  
Who qualifies for public benefits? 
In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions. 
Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all. 
As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.  
In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county. 
Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community. 
Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.
It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps. 
In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer. 
All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases. 
Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.
At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A week after Gov. Dan McKee asked to meet with President Donald Trump over the administration’s halt to the Revolution Wind project, he’s still waiting for an answer.
But U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is suggesting the paused project might not be dead in the water after all. In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Burgum, whose office oversees federal permits for offshore wind projects, indicated the administration was open to letting work resume on the 65-turbine project.
Burgum said in the interview that the administration was “under discussions,” with McKee and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and with project developers. Rhode Island and Connecticut were under agreements to buy power from the project after it became operational next year.
“We’re also finishing the reviews that we’ve been asked and required to make through the executive orders,” Burgum said.
The Aug. 22 letter from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to Danish wind developer Orsted A/S, ordering construction to cease on Revolution Wind, cited Trump’s Jan. 20 memo which put an indefinite pause on federal approvals for offshore wind projects.
“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,” Matthew Giacona, BOEM acting director, wrote in the letter to Orsted.
The move prompted immediate and mounting backlash by state and federal officials over the economic and environmental consequences of the stop work order, which halted a project already 80% complete. 
McKee reiterated the risks to thousands of labor union jobs, state climate change mandates and grid reliability in his Sept. 3 letter to Burgum, in which he asked to meet with Trump. No meeting has been held or scheduled as of Wednesday, said Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office. She did not respond to follow-up questions regarding if there was any communications between the governor and the administration.
A day after McKee called for a one-on-one with the White House came a pair of lawsuits, filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general and by the project developers, respectively. The complaints — one filed in Rhode Island and the other in D.C. — both seek court intervention to reverse the stop work order on Revolution Wind, arguing it violates constitutional separation of powers protections. The federal administration has not yet responded to either complaint, according to public court dockets. 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in an interview Wednesday said he believes the federal courts are the only way to revive Revolution Wind.
“This president is not turning wind back online willingly,” Neronha said.
Indeed, Burgum lambasted the offshore wind industry overall, calling the projects “a literal train wreck in terms of their economics,” in his CNBC interview.
Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Interior, declined to offer additional comment when contacted Wednesday afternoon. 
Orsted and its development partner have already invested or committed $5 billion into the project off Block Island, and expects to face another $1 billion in “breakaway costs” if the project is canceled, according to its court complaint.
Meanwhile, regional ratepayers across New England could face a $500 million annual increase in supply prices starting in 2028 without the project, according to Connecticut energy officials. Specific bill impacts in Rhode Island have not been determined, though the fixed price by which Rhode Island Energy will purchase power from the wind project is more than 33% lower than the winter electric rate the company proposed for the six-month period beginning Oct. 1.

The group has organized weekly gatherings on Saturdays for the past several months in front of the luxury resort Bishop's Lodge in a dispute over a sewage treatment project. (Courtesy of Protect Tesuque)An administrative hearing officer on Sept. 8 issued a formal recommendation that New Mexico environment officials approve the wastewater permit by a luxury resort surrounding housing development, over the objections from Tesuque Village residents.
Earlier this year, the New Mexico Environment Department gave initial approval for a draft permit for Bishop’s Lodge and a nearby development in Tesuque to discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two disposal fields on the property.
State environment officials and the owner of Bishop’s Lodge have repeatedly emphasized that the water from the new wastewater treatment plant is “designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
Tensions have been building for the last year, as dozens of residents in the village of about 1,000 have opposed multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort, claiming the method will pollute drinking wells downstream, and that state officials are unequally enforcing water treatment standards.
Opposition coalesced into the organization Protect Tesuque, which has mounted weekly protests, and filed objections during administrative proceedings and in the courts. In July, the New Mexico Supreme Court threw out an emergency petition by the group Protect Tesuque to stop the permitting process.
Hearing Officer Felicia Orth — who operates similarly to a judge in administrative hearings — issued a 66-page recommendation Wednesday saying she found no reason to deny the permit under the law.
NMED Secretary James Kenney’s approval is the final step needed to finalize the permit. Drew Goretzka, an NMED spokesperson, told Source NM approval is required within 30 days of the report’s filing.
Orth addressed objectors directly in her order, saying that “[Protect Tesuque’s] proposed findings and conclusions were not suitable for inclusion.” She wrote the group’s arguments were inaccurate, noting that objections called the project “an open sewer,” which is false.
“This language may have effectively inflamed emotions in the community, but it is unhelpful in a pleading. None of the scary-sounding conjecture in the proposed findings around the potential for the random introduction of pharmaceuticals or hazardous materials provides a basis for permit denial,” Orth wrote.
She further noted that state officials will require Bishop’s Lodge to sample the treated wastewater for additional pollutants within the next 90 days and to require further treatment or testing if contamination is found.
The resort welcomed the hearing officer’s decision, said Chris Kaplan, the head of Asset Management at Juniper Capital, which owns Bishop’s Lodge.
“We are encouraged by the hearing officer’s report, and we look forward to continuing to operate our new advanced wastewater treatment facility in compliance with the law and all permit requirements,” Kaplan said in a statement. “Bishop’s Lodge has been in operation for more than half a century; and, as the report acknowledged, the evidence presented in the May 2025 hearing demonstrates that the Lodge’s upgraded wastewater treatment facility meets all New Mexico water quality standards and then some.”
Emails and texts to members of Protect Tesuque requesting comment were not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon.
Bishop’s Lodge and members of Protect Tesque are currently embroiled in a separate legal battle. In July, Bishop’s Lodge sued Protect Tesuque and individual lawmakers, requesting a district judge ban protests in front of the resort within a 1-mile radius, claiming they are a danger to drivers and veer into harassment.

Protect Tesuque has said the claims are exaggerated and is a form of retaliation.
“Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,” said Rusty Day, Tesuque resident and Protect Tesuque board member in a Sept. 7 news release. “This lawsuit isn’t about justice — it’s about silencing community members who are standing up for their water, their land, and their rights.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico — which does not represent Protect Tesuque —  weighed in this week, issuing a statement of support.
“We are deeply concerned about corporations weaponizing the legal system to intimidate New Mexicans into silence,” said Kristin Greer Love, an attorney with the ACLU of New Mexico. “Bishop Lodge’s lawsuit is a textbook example of using the legal system to retaliate and intimidate. The goal is to intimidate a community organization, drain their resources, and chill the speech of anyone else who might oppose them. All New Mexicans must be able to speak out on matters of public concern without fear.”
A Santa Fe judge has set a hearing for Nov. 3 in the case.

As President Trump’s immigration crackdown intensifies, many immigrants who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for years are getting snatched by masked agents and disappeared into a vast network of jails across   the country.
In Vermont, a small but growing group of young attorneys have thrown themselves into the fight to defend the immigrants’ rights. Newly minted lawyers, including recent graduates of Vermont Law and Graduate School, are now going head to head with lawyers from Trump’s Justice Department.
The attorneys have been going into Vermont’s jails and encountering terrified immigrants, many of whom are being repeatedly shuffled between states in what appears to be a deliberate effort to frustrate their attempts to obtain effective legal representation. Some detainees do not even know where they are. 
Vermont Asylum Assistance Project  (VAAP), headed by immigration attorney Jill Martin Diaz, has been a driving force behind the effort to mobilize lawyers and defend immigrants. VAAP has grown from one staff member in 2024 to what will be a staff of eight by November, including four new attorneys who are part of the national Immigrant Justice Corps. VAAP recently received a $100,000 grant from the recently established Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to hire staff, bring in attorneys and train Vermont lawyers to handle immigration cases.
Martin Diaz formerly taught immigration law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, directed its Center for Justice Reform Clinic and practiced at Vermont Legal Aid. They currently are a lecturer in the department of social work at the University of Vermont. In 2023, Martin Diaz was named by the LGBTQ+ Bar Association as one of the 40 best LGBTQ+ lawyers under 40.
I visited VAAP’s headquarters in Burlington, where I interviewed Martin Diaz, staff attorney Leah Brenner and volunteer staff attorney Andy Pelcher.
“I’m looking around at our office that’s not even unpacked and we barely have lights and WiFi. How are we holding our own against Trump’s Department of Justice that just got a big, beautiful raise?” marveled Martin Diaz, who described fighting the Trump administration as akin to David vs. Goliath.

Martin Diaz said that immigrants are “canaries in the coal mine.”
“People are really starting to look at what’s going on in the immigration system as a microcosm for what could happen to our democracy if left unchecked, not just for noncitizens, but for everyone.”
Pelcher, who graduated Vermont Law and Graduate School in 2018 and went on to get an LLM, or master of laws, described a recent visit to Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, where he encountered a Palestinian man who was a survivor of torture who “had been bounced around to a number of facilities during the 14 months that he had been detained.” Somehow he landed in a Vermont jail. 
“People are being frequently transferred from facility to facility, seemingly as a means to deny access to counsel, family, local networks of support, and any other means by which these individuals can meaningfully prepare for their defense against removal,” said Pelcher. VAAP, together with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, took on the man’s case.
VAAP’s experience finding and aiding immigrants in Vermont’s jails has led Martin Diaz to oppose the idea of closing Vermont’s jails to ICE. “I would not advocate for more beds, but I would also strongly caution against a wholesale end to ICE’s ability to detain people in our state,” they said. “The truth is that there is no substitute for lawyers getting in their cars, going to a facility with our bodies and meeting one on one in private with our clients directly.”
“It’s really, really difficult to provide people with legal help telephonically, when the people who have your clients in custody have no respect for the rule of law and for individuals rights.”
Is America’s legal system up to the task of defending rights and institutions in the Trump era?
“I do have hope that the rule of law will prevail and that this horrible, horrible, tragic moment in our history, this painful moment for our community members who are being directly impacted, can also be a galvanizing opportunity for us to rethink what do we want our laws to say? What do we want due process to look like? What checks and balances do we want?” said Martin Diaz.

Photo by Mike Clark/For the Daily Montanan)OKLAHOMA CITY – Drag shows containing obscenity in public places or in front of children are illegal, according to an Oklahoma Attorney General’s opinion released Wednesday.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the binding opinion describes “clear red lines” to determine when the performances are free speech or a punishable crime.
Under Oklahoma law, obscene material includes depictions of sexual conduct that meet three criteria, the opinion said.
First, it is patently offensive as determined by the average person applying contemporary community standards, the opinion said.
Second, it appeals to prurient interest in sex as a dominant theme, the opinion said.
Finally, it lacks serious literary, artistic, educational, political or scientific value, the opinion said.
Sexual conduct includes intercourse, sodomy, masturbation, or exhibiting genitals or pubic areas, the opinion said.
Whether specific drag performances meet those elements involves fact questions outside the scope of the opinion, the opinion said.
Drummond said he would be issuing guidance to law enforcement.  
Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, asked for the opinion after the passage of House Bill 1217, which became effective in May. Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, and Sen. David Bullard, D-Durant, were the authors.

The law prohibits individuals from performing sexually explicit or obscene acts in public places or areas where minors are present. It bans political subdivisions from authorizing the performances.
The new law created some confusion, she said.
“I think it was necessary to clarify the issue, and this opinion certainly did do that,” Daniels said.
She said the issue of drag performances in outdoor public facilities in front of children had been a topic of discussion in her community.

Puede enfermar a la gente.,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2025/09/el-olor-a-huevo-podrido-en-el-salton-sea-no-es-solo-una-molestia-puede-enfermar-a-la-gente/,Investigadores de UCLA han descubierto que las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno en el Salton Sea están en niveles elevados y pueden causar graves efectos en la salud de quienes viven cerca del lago.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Los residentes de los alrededores de Salton Sea se han quejado durante mucho tiempo de enfermedades respiratorias causadas por la contaminación que produce el lago.
Ahora los investigadores de la UCLA han identificado otro contaminante del aire que podría estar enfermando a las personas en las comunidades cercanas al lago: sulfuro de hidrógeno.
Se trata de un gas procedente de materia orgánica en descomposición que produce olor a huevo podrido y se asocia con irritación ocular, dolor de cabeza, náuseas y otros síntomas. En dos informes publicados la semana pasada, el Instituto de Política Latina de UCLA describió cómo las floraciones de algas producen este gas en el agua y cómo se propaga por los barrios cercanos.
 “Las comunidades que viven junto a la costa o a menos de una milla de ella están expuestas al sulfuro de hidrógeno”, dijo Consuelo A. Márquez, autora de los informes junto con Alejandra López e Isabella B. Arzeno-Soltero. “Escuchamos historias: ‘Mi hijo sufre de hemorragias nasales crónicas y ha tenido asma toda su vida’”.
El Salton Sea cruza los condados de Riverside e Imperial, y es el lago más grande de California. Sin duda, también es el más contaminado. Con casi el doble de salinidad que el océano, está contaminado por escorrentías agrícolas y floraciones de algas tóxicas. A pesar de su contaminación, el mar es un refugio para más de 400 especies de aves y una parada clave en la Ruta Migratoria del Pacífico, una de las principales rutas migratorias de aves de Norteamérica.
 California creó recientemente la Reserva del Mar Salton para restaurar el hábitat de las aves y la vida acuática. Los defensores de la comunidad afirman que es necesario prestar mayor atención al impacto del lago en la salud pública de las comunidades vecinas.

 “Necesitan ayuda para recibir tratamiento, medicamentos o atención relacionada con posibles problemas cardiovasculares y respiratorios”, dijo Márquez. “Está ocurriendo con una frecuencia tan alta que muchos simplemente viven con ello. Creo que se debería prestar más atención a esto”.
Los estudios de UCLA encontraron estos problemas midiendo las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno en el lago. Un estudio se centró en cómo se produce esta sustancia química en el agua. Las altas concentraciones de nitratos provenientes de la escorrentía de fertilizantes y los bajos niveles de oxígeno en la columna de agua crean un entorno que genera gases de sulfuro de hidrógeno.
 El segundo estudio analizó las concentraciones de sulfuro de hidrógeno en el aire . Los investigadores instalaron dos monitores adicionales de sulfuro de hidrógeno en la zona y descubrieron que las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno superan constantemente el estándar estatal de la Junta de Recursos del Aire de California de 30 partes por mil millones. Registraron 243 horas por encima de este umbral tan solo entre mayo y septiembre de 2024.
 En esos niveles, e incluso en concentraciones más bajas, la sustancia química puede causar numerosos problemas de salud, según la Administración de Seguridad y Salud Ocupacional de EE. UU . Estos incluyen náuseas, irritación ocular, dolor de cabeza, insomnio, problemas respiratorios, fatiga, irritabilidad, mala memoria, mareos, entre otros.
 “A medida que más datos resaltan la conexión entre el agua y la calidad del aire, es crucial monitorear la calidad del aire en todos sus aspectos, no solo los relacionados con el polvo”, afirma el informe, señalando que la región alberga principalmente a residentes latinos, nativos americanos e inmigrantes. “El problema persistente de la contaminación por sulfuro de hidrógeno es un claro ejemplo de injusticia ambiental”.
 El Mar Saltón no es la única zona con este problema. Las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno también afectan zonas del condado de San Diego afectadas por la contaminación del río Tijuana . En partes de South Bay San Diego, investigadores del Instituto Scripps de Oceanografía de la Universidad de California en San Diego, la Universidad de California en Riverside, la Universidad Estatal de San Diego y agencias federales encontraron concentraciones de sulfuro de hidrógeno aproximadamente 4500 veces superiores a las típicas de una zona urbana, según un informe publicado el mes pasado.
 Márquez afirmó que los investigadores de la UCLA solicitan un enfoque holístico de sistemas para mejorar la calidad del aire en la zona del Mar Saltón. Esto podría incluir la distribución de purificadores y monitores de calidad del aire para que los residentes puedan participar activamente en la mejora de las condiciones. También necesitan un mejor acceso a tratamiento médico para posibles problemas cardiovasculares y respiratorios. Sobre todo, los residentes quieren asegurarse de que sus preocupaciones sean escuchadas y atendidas, añadió.

Ned Lamont on Wednesday issued a slew of executive actions seeking to protect COVID-19 vaccine access in Connecticut amid recent federal changes that are causing confusion over who’s eligible for shots, where people can get them and how much they’re going to cost. 
Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration limited its approval of updated boosters to people 65 and older, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. As a result, access to the booster for anyone who falls outside those categories has been in flux. 
But the executive actions announced today by the Lamont administration buck the federal changes. 
The state’s Department of Public Health is encouraging children 6 months and older, as well as adults of all ages, to get vaccinated. Guidance issued by the Department of Consumer Protection seeks to facilitate access to the boosters at local pharmacies, and a bulletin from the Connecticut Insurance Department guarantees coverage of the shots for certain residents.
“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” Lamont stated in a Wednesday press release. 
Here’s what you need to know.
Who can get a booster in Connecticut?
On Aug. 27, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, under the leadership of the Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., approved the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine for people over the age of 65 as well as anyone with an underlying health condition that puts them at risk for severe outcomes from the virus. 
The announcement upended guidance from the past several years that allowed anyone 6 months or older to get the vaccine.
The state’s Department of Public Health issued interim guidance on Wednesday stating that all residents who qualify for a booster based on the FDA’s eligibility criteria, as well as children ages 6 to 23 months, “should” get the vaccine. It also directs that anyone 6 months or older, regardless of underlying health, “can” get a booster.
Guidance issued to pharmacists by the Department of Consumer Protection allows anyone who falls outside of the FDA eligibility criteria to show up at their local pharmacy and get a vaccine or make an appointment without a prescription, a spokesperson with the state’s Department of Consumer Protection confirmed.
“DCP has met with both CVS and Walgreens, as well as the National Association of Chain Drugstores (NACDS) and Walmart regarding this guidance,” the spokesperson stated in emailed comments. “Our guidance offers the ability for a person who falls outside the FDA eligibility criteria to show up at a CVS or Walgreens (or any other pharmacy) without a prescription.”
Prior to Lamont’s announcement, spokespeople with CVS and Walgreens confirmed that Connecticut residents could stop by a pharmacy or sign up to get the vaccine without a prescription if they were in the populations approved for the booster by the FDA. Patients can self-attest their eligibility, and no proof or additional documentation is required. 
Those who do not qualify can still receive the vaccine with a prescription from their provider, a spokesperson with CVS confirmed. 
But the CDC’s list of qualifying underlying conditions that can lead to severe COVID-19  is extensive. It includes conditions like asthma, depression and substance use disorder. People with a BMI of 25 or greater, those who are “physically inactive,” as well as anyone who is a current or former smoker, also qualify.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Lamont acknowledged that the state’s guidance conflicted with federal guidance and that it could take a couple of weeks for pharmacies to sort out.
“I’d say it’s a little tricky for a national pharmacy company to get some rulings from the feds and Health and Human Services and then different ideas from the state. They’re trying to get that balance right as well,” Lamont said.
Lamont said he’d be reluctant to use emergency powers — calling it a “last resort” — to mandate pharmacies to broadly administer the vaccine but would wait a couple of weeks to see what’s needed to ensure Connecticut residents have access to the boosters.
“If the pharmacists say, ‘That’s not enough for us because we worry about pushback from the feds,’ we’ll have to revisit that in a week or two,” he said. 
The Connecticut Hospital Association applauded the state’s actions.
“These efforts are critical in supporting patients and protecting communities across the state. As we enter respiratory virus season, individuals are encouraged to protect themselves and their families from preventable infections. Vaccination remains one of the most effective tools we have to reduce illness and safeguard public health,” a CHA spokesperson stated in a press release.
How much will it cost?
Nearly all insurance carriers are required to cover vaccines at no cost if they are recommended by what’s known as the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. ACIP’s recommendations are separate from the FDA approval issued last month. ACIP has not yet issued recommendations regarding this year’s COVID-19 vaccine. 
The committee is scheduled to meet next on Sept. 18-19, at which point coverage of the boosters could become clearer. There have been instances where ACIP’s recommendations differed from the FDA’s initial approval.
In June, Kennedy came under fire for abruptly firing all 17 members of ACIP. Days later, he appointed eight members to serve on the panel, including several who had previously advocated against vaccines.
On Wednesday, Connecticut took steps to secure insurance coverage of the COVID-19 booster for certain residents, even if ACIP ends up recommending otherwise.
A bulletin issued by the Department of Insurance confirmed that coverage for COVID-19 vaccines is mandatory under Connecticut state law under all “Connecticut-issued policies, regardless of ACIP’s position.”
However, Connecticut only has jurisdiction over what are known as “fully insured” individual and small group plans, which cover roughly 250,000 people, or 8% of the state. 
Many large employers have what are known as “self-funded” plans, where the employer pays for employees’ health care costs directly, instead of paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier. Absent a recommendation by ACIP that would mandate coverage across most providers, self-funded plans would get to decide whether to cover the cost of the booster for their enrollees. 
Chris DiPentima, the president of CBIA, Connecticut’s largest business group, did not directly answer a question regarding whether Connecticut’s large employers would voluntarily follow suit and cover the cost of the booster. 
“Employers who use self-funded plans will adopt a holistic approach to this, considering employee health and wellness along with their overall compensation and benefits package,” DiPentima stated in emailed comments.
CT DPH recommends that anyone seeking the vaccine confirm coverage with their health plan.

(Pool photo by Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)TOPEKA — A trucker wants the Kansas Supreme Court to settle a dispute about an administrative decision by the Kansas Department of Revenue to suspend his commercial driver’s license despite securing a diversion agreement on a DUI charge in Olathe.
The case on oral argument Wednesday before the Supreme Court originated with trucker David Vogt’s appeal in Johnson County District Court of the revenue department’s unilateral suspension action. District Judge Rhonda Mason determined a diversion cannot be defined as a conviction for purposes of evaluating license suspensions, but the Department of Revenue appealed.
A subsequent ruling by the Kansas Court of Appeals said district courts in Kansas lacked jurisdiction to consider challenges to Department of Revenue administrative directives relative to CDL privileges. The Court of Appeals directed Mason to reverse her order in the Vogt case.
“The Court of Appeals got it completely right,” said Charles Bradley, an attorney representing the Department of Revenue. “Based on Kansas law, a court does not have jurisdiction to review a conviction-based suspension in this matter. If this court determines that a diversion is not actually a conviction, which I’m sure it is, then unfortunately KDOR does not have authority or subject matter jurisdiction to do anything.”
Bradley’s theory inspired questions from Justice Eric Rosen, who served as a district court judge in Shawnee County before being appointed to the state’s highest court.
“How does one contest whether the driver was convicted of a DUI? Let’s just say it was a mistake … that the notice of the conviction was for the wrong person. There’s a mistake, but the KDR goes ahead and suspends this commercial driver’s license. What recourse does a person in Mr. Vogt’s position have? It seems like there is none,” Rosen said.
“Fortunately, such an error would never occur,” Bradley replied. “A conviction-based suspension can be reviewed by KDR. The person can submit written requests for review. We take a look at it. There is no hearing.”
Justice Melissa Taylor Standridge pressed Bradley about the Department of Revenue’s conclusion state law blocked a person from seeking due process through the judicial system.
“As a matter of law, would that also include challenging whether a diversion is a conviction?” she asked.
Brandan Davies, an Overland Park attorney representing Vogt, said his client received a DUI in 2021 while driving his personal vehicle in Kansas.
Davies said the Supreme Court shouldn’t allow the Department of Revenue to define a diversion in a way that precluded people from attempting to challenge administrative findings in district court.
“The definition of ‘conviction’ is at the heart of the merit of this case, but then also … whether or not the Court of Appeals opinion is correct,” he said.
For many years, Davies said, DUI attorneys as well as city and state courts operated under the belief that Kansas law forbid commercial driver’s license holders from securing a diversion for driving under the influence. In 2022, then-Attorney General Derek Schmidt issued a legal opinion that said CDL holders were eligible for diversion.
Under the assumption Vogt would be allowed to retain his CDL, Davies said Vogt entered into an agreement with the city of Olathe to resolve the DUI.
“There was no penalty taken administratively on his driver’s license,” Davies said. “Mr. Vogt had a CDL. He was saving his job. He had a diversion.”
At that point, the Department of Revenue put Vogt on notice that his CDL would be suspended for 12 months because, in the view of the state agency, state law characterized diversions as convictions.
“The state misclassified or intentionally classified diversion as a conviction and suspended his driver’s license,” Davies said.
In the original district court ruling, Judge Mason said a failure to provide Vogt with advance notice concerning the potential adverse impact a diversion could have on his CDL compromised his constitutional right to procedural due process.
Rosen indicated he was puzzled the Court of Appeals agreed with the Department of Revenue’s position that certain DUI defendants had no appellate rights in district court.
“Was that ever addressed by the Court of Appeals at oral argument or did this just come as a complete surprise when the opinion was issued?” Rosen said.
“There was no oral argument at the Court of Appeals,” Davies said. “The Court of Appeals sidestepped the merits of the case. They’re just saying, because KDR said it’s a conviction, that you can’t appeal.”
Bradley, representing the Department of Revenue, said state law regulating commercial motor vehicles included provisions directing that a person convicted of DUI must have commercial driving privileges suspended for one year. Unsafe commercial drivers shouldn’t be allowed to mask a DUI by seeking a diversion that kept the incident off a driving record, he said.
“The current case and the treatment of all DUI diversions for all CDL holders is based upon the specific wording used in these statutes,” Bradley said.
He said a first-time DUI offender was required a pay a $750 fine. That financial sanction should to be viewed as the consequence of a conviction, he said.
The Department of Revenue argued, and the Court of Appeals accepted, the notion that the Legislature enacted a path to judicial review only when a CDL was revoked for life after a second or subsequent DUI conviction. This meant there was an avenue to district court for persons who completed a 10-year period of CDL disqualification and had been denied restoration of privileges by the agency.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230201_KSSupCourt.EN_.POOL-17-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 16:57:16.641437

(Image via Governor's Office Flickr feed)Just over half of Massachusetts residents approve of the job Maura Healey is doing as governor – holding steady according to a new poll – but any challengers aligning themselves with Donald Trump will have to contend with the president’s persistent deep unpopularity in the Bay State.
In a new poll for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – 1,000 Massachusetts residents weighed in on the state and federal executives between August 11 and 18. (Topline | Crosstabs)
Asked how they thought Healey is doing as governor, 20% of residents said they strongly approve of her performance, 36% say they somewhat approve, 15% somewhat disapprove, 18% strongly disapprove, and 11% said they were unsure. The credibility interval is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Most Massachusetts residents have an opinion on Trump’s performance, with only 4% unsure. And they’re more firmly opposed to the president’s actions. Some 48% of the respondents said they strongly disapprove, 12% somewhat disapprove, 18% somewhat approve, and 17% strongly approve.
“Healey looks to me like a conventional Democrat,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling group. “She draws more cross-party support than Trump. Republicans don’t love her, but they also are not united against her the way Democrats oppose Trump.”
Between Healey’s own base and enough independents, he said, it’s a “perfectly fine poll” for the incumbent. “It’s a long campaign with a lot to come,” he said. “But this poll on its own doesn’t feel like a warning sign.”

Though the poll was fielded in August before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a series of moves that will limit who is eligible for COVID vaccines, Bay Staters were already holding Kennedy in generally low regard, though not quite as much as the president. The poll found 56% of residents disapproved of Kennedy’s performance and 34% approved.
Healey last week announced that Massachusetts would chart a new path to break ties with the new federal vaccine policy.
“The government is failing its responsibility to Americans, including Bay Staters,” Healey said. “So we’re here to say: This is not going to happen in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we will not let Donald Trump or Robert Kennedy get in the way of patients, and the care, and the treatments and the medication that they want and need.”
Predictably for this era of hyper-partisan and nationalized politics, party affiliation was the major indicator of approval or disapproval for state and federal leadership.
Some 42% of registered Republicans and independents that lean Republican – groups that largely vote the same way – strongly support Trump’s performance, 39% somewhat support him, 9% somewhat disapprove, and just 6% strongly disapprove.
The polarization was even sharper among Democrats. Only 6% of Massachusetts Democrats or independents that lean Democratic said they strongly supported the president’s performance. Three-quarters of the Democrats and leaners strongly oppose Trump’s performance.
The firm majority of registered Republicans and leaners are chilly to Healey’s performance overall. But while 66 percent either strongly or somewhat disapprove of her, 27% said they strongly or somewhat approve of her performance.
The governor does still hold her Democratic base, with 80% of Democrats and leaners saying they approved of her performance. But that was somewhat softer support, split between strong approval and somewhat approving. Only 3% of the group said they strongly disapproved of Healey’s performance.

Her overall numbers are still a far cry from her unusually popular predecessor, Charlie Baker, even as Trump’s first term sparked outrage in the Bay State.
During Baker’s first run for governor, he was widely perceived as stridently partisan – a mismatch for the generally liberal Massachusetts electorate. But after toning down his pitch and winning a tight race against Attorney General Martha Coakley by less than 2 percentage points in 2014, Baker moved to the center with a Mr. Fix-It brand.
In 2017, as midterms approached and the gubernatorial election was just a year away, Baker was viewed favorably by 67% of the state’s voters and held leads of at least 34 points against his three declared Democratic challengers.
By the end of Baker’s term, his support came more from Democrats than Republicans, Koczela noted. “That’s a better formula for Baker,” he said, “since registered Republicans are such a small part of the electorate.”
Healey’s election marked the return of one-party rule on Beacon Hill, and some political watchers mulled that there may be interest in rebalancing the state level partisan math if a strong candidate came along.
Relatively little polling has tested out the odds of Healey’s Republican challengers, Brian Shortsleeve and Mike Kennealy, who both worked in the Baker administration and are currently criticizing each other over fundraising while going after Healey on shelter capacity, crime, and spending. A February UMass Amherst poll found Kennealy trailing Healey 40% to 15%, and Shortsleeve behind 44% to 12.
“Donald Trump has a 35% approval rating,” Koczela noted. “Aligning with him could be helpful in winning a Republican primary but won’t help with the broader electorate. This has been the conundrum for GOP candidates in Massachusetts since Trump came on the scene.”
In net approval – total approval minus total disapproval – Healey struggles with voters without college degrees and is barely above water with true independents and residents of Southeast Massachusetts. That region tends to be the hardest area for Democrats, Koczela said.
Healey also seems to be a bit softer than a Democrat might like among non-white residents, which are generally reliable Democratic voters and with whom the poll shows Healey has net positives of 28 percentage points. Non-white voters in 2024 chose Kamala Harris over Trump in Massachusetts 73% to 25%, a 48-point margin.
Though Massachusetts does not have exit polls during non-presidential years, Healey won cities and towns with heavily Latino populations by healthy margins in 2022. For instance, she won Fall River with 57% of the vote to Geoff Diehl’s 41%.
“In 2024, Massachusetts saw a major realignment, particularly among Latino voters,” Koczela said. “This showed up in places like Lawrence, Fall River, and other Gateway Cities with Trump making major gains over past Republican candidates. Democrats would certainly hope for a strong performance among the state’s voters of color to show this was a one off, and this poll doesn’t clearly point in that direction.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Legislators finalized rules this week allowing additional grounds for challenging a person’s right to vote in South Dakota.
The rules, approved Tuesday by the Interim Rules Review Committee, are a result of Senate Bill 185, which was signed into law in March. It expanded the justifications for challenging voter rights to include claims that a registered voter has died, is not a legal resident of the state or has voted or registered in another state.
Previously, state law allowed challenges based on a person’s identity, a felony conviction or mental incompetency. Those challenges are still allowed.
The new rules were part of a larger package presented by the Secretary of State’s Office and the Board of Elections to align with several “election integrity” bills approved by lawmakers earlier this year. Activists who favor the hand-counting of ballots, oppose the use of vote-counting machines and deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election were among those who supported the legislation.
Rules not ‘perfect,’ voting official says
Deputy Secretary of State Tom Deadrick told committee members it was “challenging” to “keep the due process in line” for people who are being challenged.
“I’m not going to tell you it’s a perfect package, because I doubt if it’s perfect,” Deadrick said, “but I think it’s a pretty good package that takes care of the legislative intent.”

State Sen. Amber Hulse, R-Hot Springs, sponsored the legislation. She told South Dakota Searchlight that the rules are largely aligned with her bill’s intentions, but she’s concerned that requiring challengers to provide personal information for voters in question could lead to privacy risks for South Dakotans.
There are people on South Dakota’s voter registration list who should not be registered to vote in the state, Hulse said. But the challenge process should be a balance.
“You have to ensure that you’re protecting people’s private information and protecting their right to vote, due process rights and other really big rights that go into these processes,” Hulse said. “It makes it feel clunky or difficult, but that’s purposeful so we’re protecting arguably more important rights than cleaning voter rolls.”
The American Civil Liberties Union-South Dakota’s Samantha Chapman originally opposed the legislation, but worked with Hulse in an attempt to make it less onerous to voters. Chapman said the rules create “stronger protections against indiscriminate challenges” because the documentation “should be hard to track down,” but she said they could be stronger for voters.
“We are putting potentially an undue burden on voters to hang on to their ability to vote,” Chapman said.
Chapman’s greatest concern is about challenges based on voting histories in other states. Sometimes a person’s voter registration in their former state isn’t canceled due to administrative oversight or miscommunication between states.
“It assumes the voter intends to vote twice when in reality it could be an administrative error outside of their control,” Chapman said.
How challenges work
Based on the new rules, challengers must be registered to vote in the same county as the person they’re challenging on residency or out-of-state registration grounds, and must submit the challenge at least 90 days before an election. Challenges based on a person dying ahead of an election, being mentally incompetent or being imprisoned must be submitted by a South Dakota registered voter at least 30 days before an election.
A challenge to a voter’s residency must include evidence that the voter is not a South Dakota resident, based on state election law. The challenger must provide, under a sworn oath in front of a notary, one of the following:

A driver’s license or ID card issued by another state.
A resident hunting, fishing or trapping license issued by another state.
A postal change of address indicating the voter moved to another state.
State or county property records indicating ownership of a primary residence in another state.
Tax documents indicating the voter is a resident of another state.
A residency affidavit or certificate from another state.

A challenge to a voter’s out-of-state registration or voting history must include a voter file from an election official in that state documenting the claim. There is not a time parameter set for voting history evidence.
The challenged voter must fill out a “verification request” mailed to them by their county auditor within 30 days of the challenge, with evidence documenting their qualifications as a registered voter. 
Challenged voters can request a hearing and appeal decisions to the board of county commissioners or circuit court, but there is no appeals process for the challenger spelled out in the rules.
The county auditor must cancel the voter’s registration if the voter doesn’t respond with sufficient evidence. But the removal can’t happen within 90 days prior to an election, and only challenged voters who don’t cast a vote in the time between the challenge and the next general election can be removed. Auditors will notify the challenger and challenged voter of their decision.
If someone votes who is later determined to be ineligible, that can be challenged through the courts rather than the new challenge process, according to Hulse. She said the new process is designed to remove registered voters who are both ineligible and inactive.
“This process is more for folks who claim residency but aren’t participating in elections,” Hulse said, adding that such people can influence election district boundaries when they’re counted as registered voters.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A federal judge denied a new trial Wednesday for former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren and reset their sentencing on fraud and kickback convictions for Sept 16.
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson found that the inadvertent playing of an unredacted interview with Casada by FBI agents wasn’t enough to merit a new trial. Defense attorneys for Casada and Cothren claimed that the recording, which was mistakenly played in court, incriminated Cothren and prejudiced the jury in the four-week trial.
In a phone hearing Wednesday, Richardson determined that prosecutors made a mistake but that the defense’s request failed to meet a series of five factors for holding a new trial.
In FBI agents’ recording of their interview with Casada, the former House speaker said Cothren’s participation in Phoenix Solutions couldn’t be known because payments to the vendor wouldn’t have been approved. Cothren had left his legislative job amid a racist and sexist texting scandal.
Federal prosecutors brought up the fact that they played the wrong recording a day later, Richardson said, and defense attorneys didn’t catch the error when it happened. The judge also pointed out the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence that Cothren’s identity had to be kept secret for the plan to work.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Richardson threw out three convictions Tuesday against Casada and Cothren, saying prosecutors failed to prove they operated as agents of the government. Casada still faces 14 counts and Cothren 16 counts in the case.
Responding to defense attorneys’ requests for more time to prepare for sentencing in light of the three charges being thrown out, Richardson moved the sentencing hearing to Tuesday. It was initially set for Friday.
The judge did not make a decision on whether to hear from an alternate juror who wrote a letter saying she would have voted to acquit the pair.

(Photo courtesy of Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory)Following efforts to crack down on xylazine, two members of Florida’s Cabinet are looking to reclassify the drug commonly used by veterinarians so it is more accessible to those caring for animals. 
Attorney General James Uthmeier and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson say they’ve filed to reclassify xylazine, a controlled substance illegal to possess or sell in the state, to include an exemption for veterinarians to use the animal sedative. 
The drug, although originally developed for humans, is not recognized for human use but is often found cut into street drugs like fentanyl. 
“By providing an exemption for xylazine for this limited purpose, we are protecting access for legitimate veterinary use while keeping this dangerous substance out of the hands of drug dealers and abusers,” Uthmeier said in a social media post. 
Lawmakers and law enforcement officials have cracked down on the drug, making it less accessible.
The reclassification would allow only veterinarians to obtain the drug. Livestock producers would only be able to access the drug from veterinarians. 
Selling or intent to sell xylazine is a third degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lawmakers proposed the veterinary exemption during the 2025 regular legislative session, although that bill did not pass.
The attorney general’s office did not respond to a Phoenix question as to how the reclassification would be implemented, considering drug schedules are enshrined in statute.
“The Florida Veterinary Medical Association (FVMA) supports the xylazine veterinary exemption proposed by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier,” the FVMA said to the Phoenix.
The group lobbied in favor of the bill that did not pass.
“The necessity and importance of the exemption is that it will enable veterinarians to have access to a critical, effective, and safe sedative when medically necessary evaluations, treatments, and surgical care are required for the health and welfare of animals. The FVMA has engaged in crucial efforts for this exemption due to our mission of advancing the veterinary medical profession, promoting animal health and well-being, and protecting public health.”
Dr. Kent Mathias, a psychiatrist and addiction-medicine doctor at the University of Florida, said people inadvertently take xylazine because those manufacturing street drugs cut the veterinary drug into it. 
“The whole goal of this, obviously, is to make the drug seem more powerful so they can get more money for it while putting less of the actual drug into,” Mathias said. 
The veterinary-to-street-drug trend is also seen with medetomidine, an anesthetic used for animals. 
“It seems that they are using the veterinary drugs because no one’s really looking for them at first and it’s hard to test for,” Mathias said. A common indicator people have injected Xylazine, Mathias said, is ulcers near the area the drug where the drug was administered, which he said can be “pretty severe.”
The drug cannot be reversed with naloxone, unlike opioids.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A special election to fill the Providence City Council’s vacant Ward 2 seat — which represents the Blackstone, College Hill, and Wayland neighborhoods — is set for Tuesday, Dec. 2. A primary date is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 4. 
The contest already has three contenders. The latest hopeful is Democratic pollster Matt McDermott, who announced his intent to enter the race Wednesday morning.
McDermott has served as national co-chair of the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund Campaign Board and worked with candidates like U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who was elected in 2024 to become the first openly transgender person in Congress. 
David Caldwell Jr., president of the Audubon Society of RI, and Jeff Levy of the law firm Levy & Blackman LLP previously announced their candidacy. Both candidates are Democrats.
City charter rules triggered a special election for Ward 2 to fill the seat left by Helen Anthony, who resigned Sept. 1. Anthony’s resignation was OK’d by the Providence City Council at its Sept. 4 meeting, the first after the Council broke for its summer recess. 
Candidates must declare their intent to run by filing forms with the city’s Board of Canvassers between Sept. 25 and 4 p.m. on Sept. 26. Nomination papers go out on Oct. 2, and need to be returned by Oct. 7 with at least 50 signatures from eligible voters in Ward 2.
McDermott, who lives with his husband, a grade school teacher, in Wayland Square, calls for expanding affordable housing and returning schools to local control, after being under state control since 2019.
“Providence stands at a pivotal moment — a time when bold action can shape our future,” McDermott said in a Wednesday statement. “We need leaders who defend our values, build real collaboration, and deliver transparent, community-led governance.”
Caldwell’s website indicates that he shares the goals of returning schools to local control and creating more affordable housing. The Marine Corps veteran also wants to prioritize meeting Rhode Island’s Act on Climate goals and protecting the environment — a commitment he traces back to his deployment during the Iraq invasion.
“My most vivid memory during that deployment was standing on the Kuwaiti border as Saddam Hussein set the Rumaila oil fields ablaze, turning day into near-darkness,” Caldwell wrote. “Missiles occasionally flew overhead, intercepted by our Patriot batteries. In that moment, wearing a chemical weapons suit on the other side of the world, I made a promise: my children would never have to fight oil wars abroad.”
Caldwell moved with his wife from California to Rhode Island in 2008, then to the East Side in 2017 so his daughters could attend the Lincoln School, an all-girls college preparatory school. 
Levy’s website promises that he will “fight to protect our city from Trump.” Levy wrote that he wants to keep the capital city “welcoming, safe, and affordable,” and cited his pro bono work against election theft and volunteer work with the American Civil Liberties Union as proof he’ll bring “relentless advocacy” to City Hall.
“That means putting in the hard work to find fair and equitable solutions to the budget, schools, and housing — and being ready to fight back against the looming MAGA assault on our city,” Levy wrote. “I am ready to do both.”
Levy has lived with his family in Providence for 27 years and has coached the Fox Point East Side Little League.
Anthony announced her resignation Aug. 1, citing her continued recovery from severe injuries she sustained in a 2023 accident in a California state park while on vacation. Anthony was in a crosswalk when she was hit by an 82-year-old motorist who mistakenly hit the gas on the large ATV she was driving. She had served on the council since 2019.
Anthony chaired the council’s Finance Committee, which is directly responsible for forging the capital city’s budget each year in concert with the mayor’s office. The committee on Tuesday night elected Councilor Jo-Ann Ryan, who represents Ward 5 and first took office in 2014, as the its chair. Ryan previously chaired the committee from 2019 to 2023.
“City Council has no greater responsibility than to be effective stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Ryan said in a statement Tuesday. “I intend to lead this committee with transparency and diligence as we work together to build a city that serves the best interests of all of its residents.”
During her first stint as chair, Ryan oversaw city budgets which were shaped by the allocation of more than $100 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding.

Jared Polis speaks at the Colorado Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is urging the state’s congressional delegation to support the extension of a tax credit for health insurance premiums before the end of the month, with one Republican congressman already on board.
The enhanced premium tax credit for people who buy their insurance through the individual marketplace was established through the Affordable Care Act and then expanded and extended during the Biden administration in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The creation, expansion and extension of the credit were all approved by Democrats when they had a majority in Congress.

It is set to expire this year under a Republican-led Congress, and experts warn that insurance premiums could skyrocket.
“Colorado has done everything we can at the state level to blunt the damage of H.R.1 and the loss of the tax credit, but only Congress can stop these massive premium increases and the resulting loss of coverage for hundreds of thousands of hard-working Coloradans and their families,” Polis, along with Lt. Gov. Dianna Primavera, wrote to the state’s 10-member congressional delegation in a Tuesday letter, referring to the massive federal spending and tax cut bill passed this summer.
Average premium increases for Coloradans who get their insurance on the marketplace will be 170%, Polis wrote, and people who live on the Western Slope will be hit hardest. The increases are expected to be 262% in Garfield County and more than 330% in Delta and Montrose counties.
U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the Western Slope counties in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, signed on last week to a bipartisan bill to extend the tax credit for one year. He is the only Colorado representative on it so far.
“Families in Colorado shouldn’t be faced with higher health care costs because Washington failed to act,” Hurd said in a statement. “Extending the Premium Tax Credit for another year gives Colorado families real stability while we work towards a permanent solution.”
The extension considered in the bill would punt the issue until after the 2026 midterm elections.
Polis did not explicitly state support of that bill in his letter, but urged an extension of the credit.
Colorado lawmakers passed a bill during the August special legislative session to inject up to $100 million to soften the premium increases. That money is dependent on the sale of insurance premium and corporate tax credits.
“Even with these steps at the state level, without congressional action to extend the tax credit, we project more than 75,000 Coloradans will still lose access to affordable health care in 2026, and rural communities will face premium increases of 300 percent or more,” Polis wrote.
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert responded “Absolutely agree!” to a social media post from U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, expressing opposition to a tax credit extension. The offices of U.S. Reps. Gabe Evans and Jeff Crank, the other Republicans in the delegation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot from court documents)A federal judge converted a temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction Wednesday in a case challenging the constitutionality of a new state law requiring Ten Commandments displays in Arkansas public schools. 
The order from U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks applies to the Conway School District, which was added as a defendant in the case last month. 
Seven families with religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed the original lawsuit in June against the four Northwest Arkansas schools their children attend — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale. The state also became a defendant in the case after the Arkansas attorney general’s office intervened. 
The plaintiffs argue their religious freedom rights are being infringed by Act 573 of 2025, which requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
Arkansas school district responses to Ten Commandments law mixed

Brooks issued a preliminary injunction on Aug. 4 to block the law, which took effect Aug. 5, from being enforced in those four districts. Attorneys for the plaintiffs were later allowed to add two families from the Conway School District, where Ten Commandments posters had been hung, as plaintiffs in the case. 
The Conway School District was also added as a defendant in the lawsuit. Brooks granted a temporary restraining order against the Central Arkansas district Aug. 28 and ordered all posters be removed from its schools by 5 p.m. the following day. Brooks converted the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction Wednesday. 
A temporary restraining order is a temporary injunction that may be issued immediately, without informing all parties and without holding a hearing. It’s intended to last until a court holds a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, according to Cornell Law School. 
In Wednesday’s three-page order, Brooks denied a request from the state for the court to reconsider its prior issuance of the preliminary injunction because “the State offers neither new facts nor new law to support its request for reconsideration.”
The state also renewed its request to narrow the preliminary injunction to the specific classrooms currently occupied by child plaintiffs in Conway, according to court filings. 
“The court rejects this request for a ‘bubble injunction’ as infeasible, unworkable, and likely to cause further injury to Conway Plaintiffs’ religious rights,” Brooks wrote. 
The converted preliminary injunction will remain effective “until this matter is decided on the merits,” according to Wednesday’s order.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In an unprecedented move, New Mexico is making child care free.
Beginning in November, it will be the first state in the nation to provide child care to all residents regardless of income, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced this week.
The state has been working to lower child care care costs since 2019, when it created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department and started to expand eligibility for universal child care. This latest change removes income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments.
The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually.
“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of $13,000 on child care annually. It’s much higher in many states.
In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years.
The state’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support.
The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion. Latinas in New Mexico led the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said.
The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour.
The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options.
Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dow told the Albuquerque Journal that she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state’s child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported.
But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation.
“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we’ll be one of the first to apply.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/day-care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 15:58:23.559383

Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot at an event in Utah, at Utah Valley University in Orem on Thursday, according to reports from the scene.
Videos circulating on social media showed students scattering after a popping sound is heard and Kirk appears to be impacted by something. A suspect is in custody, according to a UVU alert sent to students, Deseret News reported.
“A single shot was fired on campus toward a visiting speaker. Police are investigating now, suspect in custody,” the UVU alert said.
President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot. A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!”
FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X that the FBI is “closely monitoring reports of the tragic shooting involving Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.”
“Our thoughts are with Charlie, his loved ones, and everyone affected. Agents will be on the scene quickly and the FBI stands in full support of the ongoing response and investigation,” Patel said.
Kirk is a founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions and a close ally of the president. He was speaking at the university as part of his American Comeback tour.
On Capitol Hill, dozens of congressional Republicans offered prayers for Kirk, with whom many GOP members have personal relationships.
U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, paused the panel’s consideration of a bill and held a moment of silence after Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene informed the committee of the shooting.
Vice President JD Vance offered his own statement of support on X.
“Say a prayer for Charlie Kirk, a genuinely good guy and a young father,” he wrote.

Jolly leads Donalds, the Southwest Florida U.S. representative endorsed by Donald Trump, 41%-40%, with 19% undecided.
Renner leads Jolly, 42%-40%, with 18% undecided.
“This is more than just a number,” Jolly said in a post on X. “It’s a sign that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike have had enough of the chaos. It’s a sign that Floridians are ready for something better.”
The survey of 631 registered Florida voters was conducted by the Miami polling firm of Bendixen & Amandi International, with a margin for error of +/- 4.0%.
With the general election more than 13 months away, the survey revealed that a large portion of the electorate isn’t aware of who any of these candidates are.
Donalds does best in name recognition, with 50% saying they don’t know who he is. Renner is unknown to 57% of the public, while 62% said they didn’t know who Jolly is.
The survey also shows that 48% oppose a mid-decade redistricting of Florida’s congressional districts map, with 41% in support. Banning vaccine mandates is also a loser, with 60% opposing and just 37% supporting.
In a breakdown of the poll results, Bendixen & Amandi says that 43% of those who responded to the survey were Republicans, 34% Democrats, and 23% registered as non-party-affiliated (NPA) or with a third political party. That’s close to the political breakdown of the state by party registration, which now has Republicans with a 10-point lead over Democrats statewide.
A poll conducted by Victory Insights in June showed Donalds leading Jolly, 37%-31%, with 31% undecided.

(Photo courtesy of Kamiwan and Paul Oliver)A Calais couple is suing their town over its rules regarding backyard chickens that they claim could be unconstitutional. 
Kamiwan and Paul Oliver keep 19 chickens on their quarter-acre property that provide about a dozen eggs per day and meat to feed themselves and their three children. However, a town ordinance might prevent them from keeping the birds, which they argue would violate their right to food established in the Maine Constitution. 
“I have peace knowing that my family has eaten and will eat again tomorrow thanks to our flock of 19 chickens,” said Kamiwan, in a virtual news conference Wednesday morning. 
“Even with that peace, I have spent many sleepless nights worrying whether the city will attempt to enforce this unconstitutional ordinance upon us. We live in fear that since we do not and, sometimes, cannot comply with the many limitations of the ordinance that we will lose one of our main sources of food.”
In June 2024, the city of Calais adopted an ordinance that does not allow residents to keep more than six chickens per household. The ordinance also requires the birds to be kept on at least half an acre of land and coops must be at least 20 feet from an abutting property. There are also restrictions on where the coops can be on a lot. Existing coops that do not comply were not grandfathered.
The Olivers are being represented by the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, a national civil liberties law firm that represents people pro bono. 
The lawsuit, which was filed in the Washington County Superior Court, hinges on the right to food that was enshrined into the state constitution in 2021. The amendment to the state constitution, which was passed by voters, says Mainers have a “natural, inherent and unalienable right to . . . grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.”
“We are filing the suit today to ensure the Olivers can continue to use their property to provide for themselves without bothering anyone else,” said Nick DeBenedetto, a litigation fellow with the Institute for Justice working on this case. He added that the Olivers have never received a complaint about their flock.
The city has 21 days to respond now that the suit has been filed, DeBenedetto said. The city did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.
Maine was the first state in the country to guarantee a right to food, so the issue has sparse legal precedent, but its limits have been tested in court before. 
In 2022, another Maine couple filed a lawsuit that argued the state’s Sunday hunting ban was unconstitutional after the passage of the right to food amendment. However, the state’s highest court found that the Sunday ban does not violate the right to food because it falls under the poaching exception in the amendment. 
Earlier this year, the state also passed legislation that bars a county or municipality from adopting a regulation that prohibits a person from keeping chickens on their residential property. However, it also specifies that the new statute doesn’t limit home rule authority for the municipality. The new law doesn’t take effect until later this month. 
DeBenedetto said the new law was a factor in the timing of this lawsuit. He explained that the law prevents a town from outright banning residents from keeping chickens on their property, but it leaves room for reasonable regulations. 
However, he said, “that’s where the mischief lies in this case.”
The series of regulations in Calais don’t explicitly ban chickens, but he argued that “when taken together and when you look at the practical effect of the regulations they amount to a ban for Calais residents.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A federal judge in the U.S. Western District Court opined on Tuesday that Shenandoah County School Board’s decision to restore the moniker of Stonewall Jackson High School violated a group of students’ First Amendment rights, since it compelled them to promote a positive image of the Confederate general.
In siding with the students, U.S. Court Judge Michael F. Urbanski wrote that Jackson’s name “is expressive as a symbol of racial exclusion in public schools.”
In June 2024, the NAACP Virginia State Conference and five students enrolled in the school division filed a lawsuit alleging that the board’s decision to rename the school after the controversial Civil War era figure violated the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs want Confederate names, mascots and vestiges removed from the school, and to prevent any future school naming involving Confederate leaders or references to the Confederacy.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)
Urbanski said that the board cannot force anyone to express a message, and that the students were being forced to convey a message endorsing Jackson by their school being renamed after him, and by wearing their school’s “Generals” apparel and being identified as “Stonewall Jackson Generals” during extracurricular activities. 
“By reinstating the name “Stonewall Jackson High School” and thereby compelling students to advance the School Board’s chosen message favoring “Stonewall Jackson” through the conduct of extracurricular activities rendered expressive by that name, the School Board has violated plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, against compelled speech,” Urbanski wrote.
Urbanski granted the students’ summary judgement, denied the school board’s counter motion and deferred a final judgment on the matter. A trial has been set for Dec. 8, 2025.
“The federal district court judge delivered a powerful victory for students, affirming that they cannot be obligated to promote the legacy of Stonewall Jackson—a symbol deeply associated with the Confederacy,” Marja Plater, senior counsel at one of the law firms representing the civil rights group and students, said in a statement Wednesday. “The court’s opinion makes it unmistakably clear: students deserve the freedom to define themselves unencumbered by symbols they do not choose.”
Li Reed, an attorney with Covington & Burling, which is also representing the plaintiffs, added that the decision is a “key vindication” of what their clients have argued since the reinstatement of the Confederate name was proposed by the school board, which students said amounted to “forcing them to constantly espouse pro-slavery, anti-Black messages is a violation of their First Amendment constitutional rights.” 
Rev. Cozy Bailey, president of the NAACP Virginia State Conference, said the judge’s ruling “reinforces what we know to be true; those who led the Confederacy should not be honored.”
Virginia school board restores Confederate names

On May 10, 2024, the Shenandoah County School Board reversed a 2020 decision by a previous board to rename two schools bearing the names of Confederate Generals Turner Ashby, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in alignment with a nationwide effort to make schools more inclusive and equitable.
Some people, including a group of Shenandoah residents who support the school names’ reversal, believe the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union and their fight for states’ rights. Others, including civil rights groups and Shenandoah students and families who oppose the schools’ renaming, view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational part of America’s history of racism, and say modern use of Confederate symbols contributes to racial tensions.
Between the 1950s and 1960s, Shenandoah County officials named public schools after Confederate leaders.
The Mercury contacted the school board for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

(Photo via Getty Images)Local and tribal governments in New Mexico can expect to begin applying for state funding to support solar energy projects by the end of the year, state officials told lawmakers on Wednesday.
At the New Mexico Finance Authority (NMFA) Oversight Committee’s meeting in Deming, NMFA Deputy Director Fernando Martinez said applications for the newly created Local Solar Access Fund will open in early 2026 but the agency is hoping to have them ready by December.
The fund is a $20 million pot of public money for grants for solar energy and battery storage for tribal, rural and low-income schools, municipalities, counties, land grant communities and New Mexico’s seven regional Councils of Governments.
The projects supported by the fund are meant to reduce energy costs for low-income households and community service providers; support the local renewable energy workforce; enhance community resilience during emergencies; and leverage other funding sources, according to Martinez’s presentation to the committee.
The new law requires NMFA to provide project grants for designing and building solar systems, and help developers obtain state and local permits or apply for federal or other funding sources, the presentation states.
“We’ll be in the meantime building the applications internally so that we have a really good system so that when we open it up, it’s a really straightforward process, and we have a really good client experience for them, so it’s not too difficult,” Martinez said.
An advance copy of the proposed rule for funding decisions given to the committee on Wednesday also requires NMFA to work with the state Energy, Minerals, & Natural Resources Department to create minimum standards for proposed systems and metrics for applicants. Those metrics include capacity for the scope of work; project location; how much a project will contribute to a community’s “resilience;” and any other benefits that may result.
The new law requires most of the funding to benefit rural communities. The proposed rule specifies at least 60% of the money, approximately $10.8 million, be allocated to rural communities with a total county population of 60,000 or fewer people. No more than 25% of the money can go to any one county, the rule states, including the county government itself.
Half of New Mexico’s population lives in the 30 more rural counties, Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) told the committee, while the other half lives in Bernalillo, Santa Fe and Doña Ana counties.
“We don’t want to forget about either 50% of the population,” Cates said. “I appreciate that the drafters of this bill understand that rural communities are at a disadvantage and are giving them more than 50% of the opportunity for this program.”
The proposed rule sets a $16 million limit total for project grants and $2 million for technical assistance, leaving $2 million for NMFA to administer the program and cover any unexpected costs, NMFA spokesperson Lynn Taulbee told Source NM.
New Mexico’s implementation of new solar funding law comes as the federal government reverses the prior administration’s moves to boost renewable energy production.
A law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022 gave developers tax and energy production credits for wind and solar projects, but President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” abruptly ended those credits in July.
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Then in August, the Trump administration clawed back $7 billion in grants for solar energy projects for low-income households from the same Biden-era law that would have benefitted 60 recipients, including EMNRD.
New Mexico also has a different program for businesses and low-income households to receive energy from solar farms.
During the presentation, NMFA CEO Marquita Russel noted that both the NMFA and the legislative oversight committee will need to approve the Local Solar Access Fund’s rules by November. Once initially approved, the committee will have to sign off on any future changes, she said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Supreme Court tossed out a lawsuit challenging a gubernatorial executive order that ends remote work for state employees.
The high court issued an 8-1 ruling on Tuesday that found state Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, did not have standing to sue because he was not directly impacted by Gov. Kevin Stitt’s order that state employees return to in-person work. 
Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, in February sued Stitt, arguing the Republican governor didn’t have the power to unilaterally mandate a return to the office, and it was instead the responsibility of the Legislature. 
Fugate did not have legal standing to seek relief from the courts as he did not have a “personal stake” in the outcome, Chief Justice Dustin Rowe wrote in the majority opinion. 
“Representative Fugate has failed to demonstrate that he – in his official capacity – has suffered an injury in fact,” Rowe wrote. “Representative Fugate has not seen his votes affected by the Executive Order, nor can Representative Fugate successfully demonstrate the Executive Order usurps legislative power.”
Rowe referenced the Oklahoma Emergency Management Act of 2003 which gives the governor power to assume “direct operational control” over the emergency management functions in Oklahoma and “empowers” whoever holds the office to “make, amend, and rescind” the necessary orders and rules to carry out the Act. 
In March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Stitt authorized remote work that “balances the safety and welfare of state employees with the critical services they provide.”
In December, Stitt issued an executive order requiring all state employees to end remote work by Feb. 1. Fugate’s initial lawsuit was filed in late February. 
An Oklahoma County judge dismissed the lawsuit in March, but Fugate appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Stitt celebrated the Supreme Court’s ruling Wednesday in a statement. 
“Rep. Fugate spent months trying to stand in the way of common sense,” he said. “Taxpayers deserve to know their public servants are back at work, delivering the services they pay for and not hiding behind Zoom calls.”
Fugate said in a statement that Stitt’s claims that the court “backed” his order are false, and the Supreme Court’s order was focused on Fugate’s lack of standing to challenge the executive order. 
“As with much of his leadership, this is more theater than substance,” he said. “Nearly 10,000 state employees continue to work remotely.” 
Justice Douglas Combs was the only dissenting vote. He said he would send the case back to the district court for further litigation on the merits of Fugate’s claims. 
He wrote that the Oklahoma Constitution requires lawmakers to pass a balanced budget and Stitt’s “unilateral policy-making actions” requires the Legislature to appropriate funds for a return-to-work policy. Combs wrote that this is evidence of Fugate’s “personal injury” in this lawsuit.

Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican, on Jan. 14, 2025, at a committee meeting at the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ request to ban candy and soft drinks from being purchased with food assistance dollars has yet to be approved, while other states’ similar restrictions are expected to go into effect Jan. 1.
Lawmakers say the goal of the ban is to reduce obesity rates and risks by eliminating the option to buy soft drinks and candy for a specific demographic — low-income families receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Republican lawmakers at a Tuesday meeting of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency were anxious to see Kansas’ request for restrictions approved.
But Carla Whiteside-Hicks, the economic and employment services director for the Kansas Department for Children and Families, described during the committee meeting certain roadblocks.
Among them, she said, Kansas’ process is different from the process in other states. It’s more complex, she said, largely because of the nebulous definitions of soft drinks and candy in a new state law.
Bans of varying severity have been approved and are expected to go into effect on the first of the year in Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia. Some states restrict soft drinks, soda, candy or energy drinks, or a combination of the four.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chair of the committee, argued other states’ bans aren’t inherently simpler than the one in Kansas. Nevertheless, the definitions are important, she said.
“It sounds simple when we say pop and candy, but we know those details, those definitions matter,” she said
The state sent an initial request for the restriction to the U.S.Department of Agriculture on April 2. The proposal for a ban began as a bill, which passed both chambers during the 2025 legislative session but was vetoed on April 4 by Gov. Laura Kelly, who called it “simply wrong” and expressed concern for the law’s potential to hurt Kansas families and businesses. Instead of fully overriding the veto, Republican lawmakers inserted the policy into the state budget.
The provision withheld $1.8 million designated for a summertime food assistance program for families with school-age children. The provision required the secretary for the Kansas Department for Children and Families to request the restriction on candy and soft drinks before the department could access the funds.
Sen. Doug Shane, a Louisburg Republican, said during the meeting he didn’t understand why complexity was holding up Kansas’ request.
“And is there not any kind of national guidance considering this was part of a national policy agenda?” Shane said.
Kansas’ request is specific to Kansas statute and must work within the bounds of state law, Whiteside-Hicks said.
Upon first submitting the request to the USDA, Whiteside-Hicks said, she immediately assembled an internal team to guide the process of implementing the restrictions and measure their effectiveness.
“It was quickly evident that we do not have internal capacity to meet all of the requirements of having our waiver request approved,” she said.
No one on her team had the skillset to create an evaluation plan, she said, so the agency is soliciting proposals from third parties to do the work instead.
In Kansas, a monthly average of nearly 187,000 people in more than 93,500 households receive food assistance benefits. The average monthly benefit per household is around $452, according to USDA data from fiscal year 2023.
It isn’t clear how much it will cost to develop the new restrictions. Typically, the agency would undergo an analysis before submitting a restriction request to the federal government, but that didn’t happen this time, Whiteside-Hicks said.
Kansas officials targeted an effective date for restrictions for 18 months after the approval date — if it is approved.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250220_erickson-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-10 14:57:14.519600

California and New York could become the first states to establish rules aiming to prevent the most advanced, large-scale artificial intelligence models — known as frontier AI models — from causing catastrophic harm involving dozens of casualties or billion-dollar damages.
The bill in California, which passed the state Senate earlier this year, would require large developers of frontier AI systems to implement and disclose certain safety protocols used by the company to mitigate the risk of incidents contributing to the deaths of 50 or more people or damages amounting to more than $1 billion.
The bill, which is under consideration in the state Assembly, would also require developers to create a frontier AI framework that includes best practices for using the models. Developers would have to publish a transparency report that discloses the risk assessments used while developing the model. 
In June, New York state lawmakers approved a similar measure; Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has until the end of the year to decide whether to  sign it into law.
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

Under the measure, before deploying a frontier AI model, large developers would be required to implement a safety policy to prevent the risk of critical harm — including the death or serious injury of more than 100 people or at least $1 billion in damages — caused or enabled by a frontier model through the creation or use of large-scale weapons systems or through AI committing criminal acts.  
Frontier AI models are large-scale systems that exist at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation. These models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-5, Google’s Gemini Ultra and others, are highly advanced and can perform a wide range of tasks by processing substantial amounts of data. These powerful models also have the potential to cause catastrophic harm. 
California legislators last year attempted to pass stricter regulations on large developers to prevent the catastrophic harms of AI, but Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill. He said in his veto message that it would apply “stringent standards to even the most basic functions” of large AI systems. He wrote that small models could be “equally or even more dangerous” and worried about the bill curtailing innovation.
Over the following year, the Joint California Policy Working Group on AI Frontier Models wrote and published its report on how to approach frontier AI policy. The report emphasized the importance of empirical research, policy analyses and balance between the technology’s benefits and risks.
Tech developers and industry groups have opposed the bills in both states. Paul Lekas, the senior vice president of global public policy at the Software & Information Industry Association, wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline that California’s measure, while intended to promote responsible AI development, “is not the way to advance this goal, build trust in AI systems, and support consumer protection.”
The bill would create “an overly prescriptive and burdensome framework that risks stifling frontier model development without adequately improving safety,” he said, the same problems that led to last year’s veto. “The bill remains untethered to measurable standards, and its vague disclosure and reporting mandates create a new layer of operational burdens.”
NetChoice, a trade association of online businesses including Amazon, Google and Meta, sent a letter to Hochul in June, urging the governor to veto New York’s proposed legislation. 
“While the goal of ensuring the safe development of artificial intelligence is laudable, this legislation is constructed in a way that would unfortunately undermine its very purpose, harming innovation, economic competitiveness, and the development of solutions to some of our most pressing problems, without effectively improving public safety,” wrote Patrick Hedger, the director of policy at NetChoice.

Gov. Josh Stein signed an executive order Wednesday relaunching the Interagency Council for Coordinating Homelessness Programs, a multi-agency effort to prevent and end homelessness by strengthening coordination among partners across government and private and non-profit service providers and advocates. 
The Council for Homelessness Programs will be co-chaired by N.C. Department of Health and Human Services Policy Director Karen Wade and N.C. Department of Military and Veterans Affairs Chief of Staff Jessica Whichard, Stein’s office announced in a news release.
Stein said everyone benefits when people have a safe place to call home.
“Right now, we do not have enough homes, and the homes we have cost too much,” Stein said. “Cost is a major cause of homelessness and a major barrier when people are trying to return to housing. I am proud to relaunch this council to prevent homelessness and increase the development of affordable housing of all types so that every North Carolinian can thrive.”
A recent study commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that North Carolina has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
The Council for Homelessness Programs was first created under the Cooper administration. It advises the governor, state agencies and external partners on issues related to housing stabilization, services for people who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and strategies to reduce and end homelessness.
“North Carolinians experiencing homelessness face challenges when trying to access physical and mental health care and treatment for substance use disorder,” Wade said. “I am proud to co-chair this council and work with partners to ensure people receive the care they need in their journey to secure housing and live a healthy life.”
More than 11,500 North Carolinians experienced homelessness in 2024, including more than 3,200 families with children, more than 500 unaccompanied homeless youth, and nearly 700 veterans, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That’s a 19 percent increase from the previous year.
“Estimates say that nearly 700 veterans in North Carolina are experiencing homelessness,” Whichard said. “I look forward to co-chairing this council, working to end veteran homelessness, and continuing North Carolina’s status as a great state for veterans and service members.”
Approximately 6,600 people were experiencing homelessness in the 39 Helene disaster-declared counties, according to the news release. That number increased as a result of Hurricane Helene. The Council for Homelessness Programs will include a focus on Helene recovery to help more people find safe, affordable housing, the news release said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3502-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 14:57:14.519600

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A North Dakota judge rejected a request from the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline to pause a free speech lawsuit filed against it overseas by the environmental group Greenpeace.
The Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International brought the case in response to Energy Transfer’s lawsuit accusing it of engaging in conspiracy, defamation and other crimes to stop the pipeline from being built. That lawsuit, pending in North Dakota district court, was also filed against two other Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund.
Greenpeace denies all of Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the pipeline company’s true motivation for bringing the suit is to punish and intimidate the activists who participated in the Indigenous-led protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and 2017. In this vein, Greenpeace International in early February counter-sued Energy Transfer in the Netherlands under a European Union directive that provides recourse to those targeted by frivolous lawsuits for exercising their free speech.
Pipeline developer asks North Dakota judge to halt Greenpeace lawsuit in Europe

Greenpeace International in the Dutch case accuses the energy company of abusing the legal system to waste its time and money and of making defamatory statements about the environmental group. It ultimately wants the Netherlands to order Energy Transfer to award it monetary damages.
The Dutch lawsuit was filed shortly before the North Dakota case against Greenpeace went to trial. After sitting through more than three weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses, a Morton County jury in March found the environmental group at fault for more than $660 million. 
Greenpeace has indicated it will appeal the decision if it’s allowed to stand, though Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion has yet to enter a judgment in the case.
Energy Transfer says that Greenpeace International’s lawsuit in the Netherlands is an unlawful attempt to overturn its unfavorable ruling in North Dakota. It asked Gion in July to order that Greenpeace put the Dutch case on hold until its own lawsuit wraps up, arguing Greenpeace’s overseas litigation threatens to undermine the jury’s findings.
Gion on Tuesday denied the request.
He wrote that while the subject matter of the two lawsuits overlap, the fundamental legal claims they consider are different. For that reason, Gion said the Dutch case is not an attempt to relitigate the North Dakota lawsuit.
He also said it’s unlikely that the Netherlands court would act quickly enough to affect anything in the North Dakota case.
“Admittedly this court has no familiarity with the civil procedure in the Netherlands, and therefore, no idea how quickly the Dutch court moves on civil matters,” he added.
Gion has yet to enter a judgment following the jury’s verdict. Greenpeace has requested that he overturn the decision or reduce the $660 million award.
Gion wrote in his Tuesday opinion he expects to rule on those issues within the next week or so.
He also noted that attorneys for Energy Transfer previously indicated that if he did not halt the Dutch case, they may appeal his decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

Democrats currently hold nine out of 100 seats in the state House of Delegates while Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers.
Hornbuckle said, given the new state leadership under Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey, that it’s disappointing to see lawmakers not focus on matters of importance often voiced by residents, like “lowering their electric bill, good jobs, health care, education, affordable housing [and] clean drinking water.”

Research shows that early math skills are more predictive of lifetime earnings than reading or health factors. And as Massachusetts’s economy increasingly relies on evolving STEM jobs, we must prepare all students — not just a privileged few — for that future.
The post Reading isn’t enough: Massachusetts must solve its math crisis, too  appeared first on Co[...]","Alarm bells are blaring across Massachusetts, and everyone from the governor to grassroots advocates is finally paying attention: Reading scores are in freefall, and the panic is palpable — and rightly so. But as state leaders mobilize to address the literacy crisis, they’re overlooking a parallel emergency that is just as urgent and damaging — a deepening math crisis that threatens our students’ futures and the state’s economic vitality.
You can see it in the data, yes. But you can also hear it, more viscerally, in the quiet despair of kitchen-table confessions from parents: Their child sits at a desk, math homework spread out before them, struggling to figure out how much Tayna will need for a 25% down payment on a $250,000 house. The child’s eyes glaze over, numbers blurring, as he mutters, “I am just not a math person” and walks away.
If you’ve worked in schools, parented a child, or remember your own struggles with math, this silent surrender likely feels familiar. But it should feel unacceptable.
In today’s world, math matters more than ever. Recent research shows that early math skills are more predictive of lifetime earnings than reading or health factors. And as Massachusetts’s economy increasingly relies on evolving STEM jobs, we must prepare all students — not just a privileged few — for that future.
Moreover, in an era when artificial intelligence is reshaping every corner of our society, the skills cultivated through rigorous math education – critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical reasoning – will be more valuable than ever. Math isn’t just about numbers; it teaches us how to break down complex problems, spot patterns, exercise sound judgment, and evaluate solutions. These cognitive tools aren’t “nice to haves.” They will define who thrives — and who falls behind — in an AI-driven future.
Massachusetts can’t afford to fall behind. And yet, we are.
While the Commonwealth prides itself on being a national leader in education, the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results paint a sobering picture: Math scores across the state have plummeted to levels not seen in over two decades, with only 37% of 8th graders scoring proficient or above on the NAEP math exam. But the real emergency lies beneath the averages. Among Black students, only 14% scored proficient or above on the 8th Grade NAEP exam. For Latino students, it’s 17%. For low-income students, just 16%. In some districts, fewer than one in five students are meeting grade-level expectations in math.
This isn’t just a hangover from the pandemic — it’s a widening divide that has reached a tipping point.  So how do we ensure students in Massachusetts don’t walk away from math — and their futures?
First, policymakers and education leaders must confront the math crisis with the same urgency they’ve shown towards literacy. The same forces driving the literacy crisis — weak curriculum oversight, inconsistent use of high-quality instructional materials, inadequate teacher preparation and professional development, and chronic underinvestment in student supports — are also fueling the decline in math.
Second, the state should require universal math screenings starting in elementary school. Massachusetts already mandates early literacy screenings to identify students at risk for reading difficulties. Why not do the same for math? These screenings can help educators intervene early with targeted support, rather than waiting until students are discouraged and disengaged.
Third, Massachusetts must make bold investments in high-quality math curricula and guarantee that every student—regardless of zip code—has access to rigorous coursework, starting with Algebra by 8th grade. Algebra by 8th grade is a powerful predictor of long-term academic success, math confidence, and college readiness. Yet, a recent statewide poll found that only 40% of parents reported that their child had access to Algebra I by 8th grade, with even lower access rates for students of color and those from low-income backgrounds. State and school leaders should prioritize access to advanced math courses, while districts should explore automatic enrollment policies to help close access gaps.
But high expectations alone aren’t enough. We must pair them with proven support strategies like high-dosage tutoring, especially in middle school, where the payoff is greatest. Research shows that tutoring—when done consistently—can dramatically improve math outcomes and rebuild student confidence.
Finally, we must change the message students hear about who math is for and why it matters. As Emily Marhan, a 7th-grade math teacher in New Bedford, shared in a recent blog post for EdTrust-Massachusetts, math success isn’t about being “naturally gifted.” It’s about mindset, persistence, and feeling safe enough to take risks. In her classroom, mistakes are welcome, and struggle is expected.
Every student in Massachusetts deserves that kind of math classroom — a place where they feel seen, capable, and included, and where math feels relevant and engaging. The path to improving math outcomes in Massachusetts starts with recognizing the crisis and committing to bold, systemic change, and it ends with belief: belief in our students, and belief in their ability to learn and thrive.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t think people were all that upset about winter utility bills judging by the crowd gathered Tuesday night before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
There were no signs, no shouting, and the dozen attendees fit easily in the rows of chairs — a stark contrast to the 200 people who spilled out from the commission’s Warwick offices at a public hearing six months earlier.
Joanne Rich, a Providence resident, acknowledged the crowd’s small size immediately. 
“I almost didn’t come because this one seemed particularly futile,” Rich said. “But I am here because I didn’t want you to think for a moment that the public, the general public, is indifferent.”
Customers, advocates and lawmakers continued to rail against Rhode Island Energy, accusing the utility provider of putting profits over working families. A 206-signature petition submitted to the commission ahead of Tuesday’s hearing urged regulators to reject proposed winter electric rates which would take effect Oct. 1. The rate hikes require final approval from the PUC.
“Countless Rhode Islanders are being pushed to the brink by unaffordable rates, even as utility company profits reach new highs,” the petition, submitted by social justice group the George Wiley Center, stated. “We refuse to stand by while our neighbors suffer. It is time for the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission to take decisive action to protect residents and ensure access to these vital services.” 
Electric supply rates typically increase every winter, reflecting the regular, seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. The proposed 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour price, coupled with changes in charges for renewable energy programs and infrastructure and capital improvement, would increase the average residential customer’s monthly bill by 16.05%, or $22.28, over existing, summer prices. However, the proposed winter supply rate is nearly 10% less than last winter, and below the record high during the 2022-2023 winter.
Meanwhile, proposed changes to gas bills based on gas prices and company cost  recovery for operational expenses would cut annual bills by 10.3%, or $190.44 per year, for the average residential customer, starting Nov. 1.

Credits coming 
The projections do not yet account for extra bill credits mandated by the 2022 acquisition of the state utility operations from National Grid to PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company. Originally, the $154 million in electric and gas discounts was set to be distributed over 40 years. But faced with backlash over rising bills, including a state audit of accounting errors that resulted in overcharging certain customers, Rhode Island Energy executives hope to curry favor by giving a bigger discount sooner. 
At a rare July press conference to announce proposed winter rates — compared with the typical email notice — Greg Cornett, president of Rhode Island Energy, said the company plans to roll out monthly discounts starting in 2026. The discounts would slash electric bills $20 to $30 per month while cutting $40 to $50 from monthly gas bills, Cornett said.
The company has not submitted details of its requested credit distribution and schedule to utility regulators as of Wednesday morning, Todd Bianco, chief economic and policy analyst for the PUC, said in an email.
Separately, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources has proposed spending $5 million from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program to credit low-income customers in October through December of this year. The annual monthly credit from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative revenue was not immediately available.
Both bill credit proposals require separate approvals from state utility regulators.
The proposed mitigation measures did not dilute the fury directed at Rhode Island Energy, which reported a $183 million profit for the three-month period that ended June 30. Company executives and hired lobbyists warned against bills lawmakers introduced during the 2025 session that would have capped company profits while helping low-income, senior and ailing ratepayers with more time to pay overdue bills, or reducing total costs entirely.

‘I am all by myself’
Many critics of the proposed rate hikes reiterated support Tuesday for the Percentage of Income Payment Plan, a policy solution that already exists in a dozen other states that limits utility costs for the lowest-income residents.
“This failure is not natural or unavoidable,” Melissa Bubble, a community health worker, told regulators. “It’s a manmade failure.”
For Bubble, it’s personal. Rising rates make it harder for her to also pay for food for her children, she said.
Other ratepayers recounted the shock of having utilities abruptly shut off, or bundling in blankets, with the heat low and all appliances unplugged, to shave costs.
“It’s very hard for people like myself right now,” said Vrenely Espinosa, tearing up as she spoke. “I am all by myself.”
State law prevents the state utility supplier from boosting its bottom line through usage costs, which must directly reflect the price from third-party suppliers — a point reiterated by Brian Schuster, a company spokesperson, on Tuesday. And, state regulators cannot reject proposed seasonal rate increases as long as there is no evidence of extra profits for the company.
But, the PUC has control to limit spending on service charges, including capital investments, and can authorize policy changes. In March 2020, the commission ordered the utility operator — still owned by National Grid at the time — to give customers more time to pay overdue bills, with a lower upfront payment, before facing shutoffs. 
Rhode Island Energy is now seeking to suspend that pandemic-era requirement, which has more than doubled the debt owed by ratepayers, from $124.7 million in January 2022, to $254.9 million as of May 2025, according to written filings. If approved by state regulators, the extended payment plan would end Dec. 1, though customers already on the pandemic-era plan could remain so.
Roughly 2,700 Rhode Island Energy customers have taken advantage of extended repayment plans in 2024 and 2025, according to filings submitted to state regulators. Terminating their accounts could result in utility shutoffs for 5,000 residents, Troy Lange, an attorney representing the George Wiley Center, wrote in a June 30 letter to state regulators.
“It is critical that the Commission ensures Rhode Islanders are able to keep their utilities on, or restore service, as a matter of public safety, particularly as summer temperatures remain high and anomalous weather events—such as the heat wave which occurred the week of June 23, setting area temperature records for the month of June—occur with increasing frequency,” Lange wrote.

Feeling the strain
Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, implored regulators not to approve higher rates and end flexible debt repayment options simultaneously, noting the additional strains posed by the federal administration. 
“Times are incredibly tough, and so many people are struggling right now,” Tanzi said. “Rate increases and the change in repayment plans cannot happen simultaneously. I am not in favor of either of them, but my god, do not do them concurrently.”
Federal workers in her district have lost their jobs, while federal budget cuts are expected to reduce food assistance and government health care subsidies for thousands of Rhode Islanders. Meanwhile, the forced stop to the Revolution Wind project in late August — with 80% of the 65-turbine wind farm already complete — threatens to upend Rhode Island’s labor force and compromise climate change mandates while risking instability to the regional grid. Without it, the region’s ratepayers will pay up to $500 million more in annual supply costs per year starting in 2028, Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said last week.
Chris Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, deferred to Connecticut’s projections when asked for information about Rhode Island specific bill impacts on Wednesday.
Rhode Island Energy did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday about the local impacts of the stop work order on Revolution Wind. The company is separately in talks to buy additional wind power from another project planned off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, SouthCoast Wind. That project also remains uncertain under the Trump administration, and is still awaiting key federal permits.
The Public Utilities Commission will vote on proposed winter gas and electric rates, as well as the proposed termination of pandemic-era repayment flexibility, at separate meetings, none of which have been scheduled. 
The George Wiley Center is a recognized intervenor in the case, meaning it gets additional opportunities to speak and submit written filings to the commission during subsequent deliberations. The Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General was also recognized as an intervenor, but has not come out in opposition or support of the proposed rate changes. The AG’s office will be submitting its written testimony in the next few days, Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson, said Wednesday.
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community winter electric rates, which take effect Nov. 1, have not been announced. 
About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

Feb. 5, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceThe ticking clock on the fiscal year is becoming frantic, and in a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday morning, the lead appropriator in the Michigan Senate said it would take courage and hard work to reach a deal with House Republicans on budget within the next few weeks.
Meanwhile, House Republicans said this week that they are no closer to an agreement with their Senate colleagues, and that it was time for the upper chamber to stop playing “chicken” with the already stalled budget negotiations.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) also said that she and her colleagues were doing their best to work with their colleagues in the House to avoid a protracted government shutdown, which is looking more likely as the days get closer to Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The situation has not gotten any better over the last few weeks when the leaders of the House and Senate met to start negotiating. Both the House and Senate said those conversations went nowhere.
Despite the Senate’s own inaction on a roads funding plan, which remains the sticking point in Michigan budget negotiations, Anthony on Wednesday continued to lay the blame at the doorstep of the House.
“Since the start of this legislative term, Speaker Matt Hall has failed to step up and act as a serious partner,” Anthony said. “Instead of coming to the table to negotiate a budget in good faith, he and his Republican colleagues have chosen to manufacture a crisis in attempts to push through an extreme agenda, putting politics and petty vendettas over the people we’re entrusted to serve. Budgets are about values, and the values reflected in the House Republican proposal are dangerous and destructive. I will always fight for a fair compromise, but I will never sign off on a plan that does so at the expense of hardworking Michiganders.”
Anthony was joined Wednesday by three of her Democratic colleagues: Sen. John Cherry of Flint, Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak and Sen. Sylvia Santana of Detroit.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

McMorrow said that when the budget negotiations began, chaos and a prolonged stalemate wasn’t initially in the cards.
She also touched on the House Republican assertion that it was cutting $750 million by eliminating so-called “phantom employees,” or jobs that have gone unfilled even though the previous budgets accounted for them. McMorrow said that the assertion that these positions were evidence of fraud shows a “stunning ignorance of basic budgeting, or it’s a deliberate attempt to mislead the public,”
“Any legislator worth their salt understands a full time equivalent does not mean a full time employee. One FTE does not equal one full time employee at a standard set salary,” McMorrow said. “Instead, a full time equivalent is a way to measure how much work the department can get done, including full time, part time and contract workers, whose pay ranges.”
McMorrow added that when the House talks of underfunded staffing while also expecting departments to maintain services, they’re not being fiscally responsible.
“You’re forcing agencies to cut corners and compromise the services that our citizens count on,” McMorrow said. “And now they’ve got Donald Trump baseless promoting this lie to throw red meat to the base. To Hall and House Republicans, these cuts may feel like some moral victory, but make no mistake, Michiganders feel the cuts to services, all in service of this lie.”
House Republicans to Senate Democrats: Stop playing chicken
Shutdown fears loom as the budget crisis continues. State Rep. Cam Cavitt (R-Cheboygan), accused the Senate Democrats of failing to negotiate now that the House has presented its budget in full, despite their apparent opposition to the priorities the House advanced.
“Senate Democrats are playing some sort of twisted game of chicken where they wait to negotiate until the very last minute,” Cavitt said in a statement issued earlier this week. “It’s sick. This isn’t a game. If we don’t get a bipartisan budget done by Oct. 1, critical services will shut down. Senate Democrats are going to close our schools just like they did during the COVID lockdowns.”
Cavitt also touched on the Senate’s lack of a roads plan, and how that is holding things up.
“House Republicans have a commonsense plan that doesn’t raise taxes. All we’re asking is that the Senate come to the table with their own commonsense plan that doesn’t raise taxes,” Cavitt said. “Senate Democrats are going to shut our state down because they care more about raising taxes than they do our schoolchildren and first responders.”
Anthony was asked on Wednesday if she felt a shutdown would last longer than it did the last time the state was at an impasse over funding in 2007 and 2009 – shutdowns that lasted mere hours because the Democratic House, Republican Senate and then Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm agreed to a short term temporary budget meant to cover spending over a few months until a new deal was reached.
The senator from Lansing said she was a legislative staffer when those shutdowns occurred. She said she remembered late nights and tough decision making. Anthony hoped to avoid that this time, or worse, a longer, month-long shutdown.
“There’s real lives behind these political antics, and that’s why … the fact that House Republicans have waited so long to engage, and wasted precious time for us to avoid a government shutdown, is completely unacceptable,” Anthony said. “I’m not looking forward to a shutdown. We are trying to make sure that we’re preventing that every step of the way, even today, we’re ready.”
That said, Hall and state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), have been waiting at the negotiating table for weeks now. In fact, on social media, he posted a picture of himself and Bollin waiting to negotiate on Aug. 28, two days after the House finally passed its budget.
“We’ve been sitting in the room ready to go all day,” Hall wrote on X. “This is not the way to get this done. I think they’re afraid because we know the budget so much better than they do.”

The return to school and break in summer routine can be stressful, especially for children who may already have mental health problems. At the same time, health care officials said, teachers and other school staff are now interacting with children and referring them for help. 
The number of kids with mental health needs in the emergency departments increases at the start of a new school year, as does the number of children visiting the state’s urgent crisis centers, officials said at the Wednesday press conference. 
“This is supposed to be a really exciting time. You have kids going back to school,” said Dr. Laine Taylor, chief medical officer at The Village for Families and Children. “What it is, really, is a transition for some kids that can be exciting, but for other kids that can be anxiety provoking, that can cause a lot of stress and kids to feel overwhelmed.”
Annually, about 1 in 5 children, or 2,500 kids, who visit the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center are found to be at risk for suicide, said Dr. Steven Rogers, a pediatric emergency medicine physician working on youth suicide prevention. During the summer, the hospital typically has a census of about 10 to 20 children with severe mental health needs, but that number can jump to 30 during the school year.
The medical center has launched a Youth Suicide Prevention Center to help screen and treat children for mental health needs.
Since the pandemic, Connecticut families have reported that their children have had more frequent occurrences of mental illness and that those symptoms are more severe. Last summer, the state saw a spike in youth suicides, and mental health service providers have reported that their resources are stretched thin.
In response to the heightened need for mental health care, the state legislature in 2022 approved a law that established urgent crisis centers that aim to treat children with emergency mental health needs and keep those kids out of the emergency department where possible.
The centers are located in Waterbury, Hartford, New London and New Haven.
Department of Children and Families interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said she’d seen the need in her work at the agency and that urgent crisis centers offer an avenue to “provide support and access in a way that is more immediately available and more tied to the individual needs and circumstances for the children and families involved.”
The programs have been successful in keeping kids in their homes during treatment rather than sending them for inpatient hospital care.
“They will take care of your child. It’s become our safe haven,” said Lisa Paradis, a parent whose daughter has gotten services at the crisis centers.
Medical professionals also said parents whose children are struggling should talk with them about their mental health needs.
Rogers said it’s best to ask questions directly of a child who might be struggling with suicidal ideation.
“Just asking direct questions is the best way to do that: ‘Are you having thoughts about suicide?,’” Rogers said. “Research haas shown that actually talking about suicide has prevented kids from dying.”
Parents with questions or concerns about their children’s mental health needs can also call 988, providers said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8542-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-09-10 14:57:14.519600

And looming over the debate are approaching deadlines for Missouri ballots to be finalized and candidates to file for office, along with promises of lawsuits — with any delays potentially undermining efforts to create a new Republican seat in time for the 2026 midterm elections.
The Missouri House passed a new map Tuesday that would carve up the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, and disperse its voters into three districts that give Republicans an electoral advantage in seven of the state’s eight congressional seats.
The fate of the proposed new map is now in the hands of the Missouri Senate, where the GOP holds a supermajority and is expected to pass it to Gov. Mike Kehoe for his signature this week.
Missouri House passes gerrymandered congressional map, limits on initiative petitions

At least two groups are considering a petition drive to force a referendum vote on the map once it is signed into law. If they successfully gather enough signatures, the map would be frozen until an up-or-down statewide vote is held next year.
“I expect a citizens referendum as soon as this passes the Senate,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat.
Jake Hummel, president of the Missouri AFL-CIO, said that while he hasn’t talked directly with his members about whether to initiate a referendum, “I have a pretty strong feeling they will.”
That referendum strategy was last deployed in 2018, when labor unions collected 300,000 signatures in 90 days — more than three times the amount required — to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law.
The repeal push was ultimately successful, with 67% of voters rejecting the right-to-work law.
In fact, of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
Protesters gather at the Missouri Capitol on Wednesday to denounce GOP efforts to gerrymander the state congressional map and make it harder to amend the state constitution (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Referendum elections are required to be held on the November general election ballot unless the legislature votes to move it to an earlier date. The timing of that vote would be crucial in determining whether a new map could even be finalized in time for congressional elections next year.
According to a letter from the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities that was sent to legislative leadership last month, every election in 2026 administratively begins 10 weeks prior to Election Day.
Elections are administered in the statewide voter registration database, which houses the district boundaries and voter district assignments currently in effect and ensures voters receive the right ballot on Election Day.
District boundary lines must be “locked” during an active election, the letter states, and voters cannot be assigned to a new district during this timeframe to ensure proper ballots can be created, proofed, ordered and printed in time for absentee voting to begin.
Under that timeline, the April 7, 2026, municipal election begins administratively on Jan. 27. The Aug. 4, 2026 primary election begins administratively on May 26.
That means, at least according to local election officials, if the congressional map being considered by the legislature isn’t finalized until after May 26, it wouldn’t apply to the August primary.
Meanwhile, the candidate filing period in Missouri for the August 2026 primary opens on Feb. 24 and ends March 31. In 2022, the filing period came and went without a new map in place as lawmakers quarrelled over boundary lines.
And numerous opponents of the gerrymandering push have promised litigation, arguing it is unconstitutional to redraw Missouri’s congressional map before the next census is complete.
The idea of forcing a gerrymandered congressional map onto the ballot for voters to decide was a recurring theme Wednesday as thousands gathered at the Missouri Capitol to denounce the Republican-backed effort.
The other target of Wednesday’s rally is legislation making its way through the legislature this week that would make it virtually impossible to amend the state constitution through the initiative petition process.
If that bill clears the Senate, it automatically goes to the statewide ballot next year.
Voters, Aune said, will have the last word on both proposals.
“(Republicans) may not feel like they have to answer to us here in this building,” she said, “but they have to answer to each and every one of you.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-10 13:57:23.402844

LUDLOW — Addiction specialist Melanie Gulde helped Phish singer and guitarist Trey Anastasio after his 2006 arrest for driving under the influence and drug possession. More recently, she teamed with him to open this town’s 46-bed Divided Sky Residential Recovery Program.
Gulde knows the singer for the Vermont-formed band isn’t the only person who needs some backup.
“Women recover from addictions differently and face more barriers to treatment, often leaving them feeling overwhelmed and discouraged,” she said.

That’s why the nonprofit retreat center is launching a new women’s scholarship fund to assist those dealing with substance use disorder.
“It is more than just financial aid,” Gulde said of a fund that’s already raised $300,000 toward its $500,000 goal. “It’s a statement that every woman is worthy of a sober life, and we are here to support them.”
Women are more likely than men to face traumatic life experiences that can lead to substance use disorder, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports. Yet because of a lack of money and support, they account for only one-third of admissions to recovery facilities.
Enter Divided Sky. Anastasio had become dependent on opioids after dental surgery before he began a court-mandated recovery program under Gulde, a licensed counselor who specializes in abstinence-based, 12-step work.
The musician went on to create a nonprofit foundation, collect more than $1 million through a 2020 series of online “Beacon Jams” concerts, and purchase Ludlow’s 18-acre Fox Run at Okemo property, which features a 20-room lodge with a commercial kitchen, meeting space and exercise facility.
“I started Divided Sky Foundation to offer people the same help that I was fortunate enough to receive,” Anastasio told Ludlow leaders during a 2021 review hearing. “I’ve talked to a lot of people in the incredible, progressive, forward-thinking Vermont recovery community and there’s one place that they all agree, and that’s that we don’t have enough beds.”

After some neighbors voiced concerns, Divided Sky dropped its plans to offer medical services and medication-assisted treatment to help with withdrawal (Vermont has three such providers: Recovery House in Wallingford, Sana at Stowe and Valley Vista in Bradford). Instead, it opened in 2023 as a “nonclinical program grounded in compassion, mindfulness and the 12 steps” for long-term wellness, according to its website.
The cost of a 30-day stay is listed at $7,500. Because Divided Sky isn’t a detox or rehab center but a next-step recovery retreat, it can’t bill Medicaid, Medicare or private insurance and instead relies on scholarships.
“We don’t turn people away for lack of funds,” said Gulde, who has welcomed 265 attendees in the past two years. “Our mentality is what do you have and let’s work together to get you in the door.”
Divided Sky is establishing the scholarship fund with the help of Tamara Holder, a women’s rights attorney and advocate who covered the cost of the program’s first female participant in 2023.
“I know it’s already working,” Holder said of the center’s efforts.
Several Phish fan groups are planning to collect money for the cause in advance of Anastasio performing a sold-out set of fifth-anniversary Beacon Jams concerts in November. The frontman has good words for the new fund.
“This program,” he said in a statement, “can give more women the chance to heal and start fresh.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A federal appeals court on Wednesday largely rejected a constitutional challenge to a 2022 New Jersey law that restricts where gun owners can take their firearms, upholding the state’s ban on guns in parks, beaches, casinos, bars, arenas, and other places deemed “sensitive.”
The lengthy and long-awaited ruling comes almost two years after the state’s attorneys appeared before a panel of U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals judges to defend the law from gun owners’ claims that its wide-ranging restrictions trample their Second Amendment right to bear arms wherever they go.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said he is “thrilled” by the ruling upholding “this critical public-safety law.”
“The court overwhelmingly agreed with us on almost the entirety of the law, and the very few provisions where it didn’t were, frankly, minor pieces of the statute,” Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor.
He added: “We’re really gratified that the court rejected the gun lobby’s arguments, and they have said that you have a constitutional right under the Second Amendment, but that right doesn’t give you unfettered ability to bring guns into these sensitive places where we know people congregate, where kids congregate, where people drink, where they’re agitated, where fights occur. And that ultimately will keep the public safe.”

The ruling was not a total win for the state, with the judges refusing to uphold a restriction on guns in private vehicles; a requirement that gun owners obtain $300,000 in liability insurance against potential injuries, death, or property damage; and the law’s diversion of $50 in gun permit fees to a fund that compensates crime victims.
The decision was also not unanimous.
Judge Cheryl Ann Krause, an Obama appointee, penned the decision, which Judge Cindy K. Chung, a Biden appointee, joined.
But Judge David J. Porter, a Trump appointee, issued an incendiary dissent accusing his colleagues of “selective reading and overreading of Supreme Court precedent, methodological mistakes, and anachronistic disdain for public carry (which) combine to generate constitutional error.”
Under the majority’s decision, Porter wrote, “most places of human interest in New Jersey and all of its public transportation network are now gun-free zones.” That violates people’s right to bear arms in public for self-defense, he wrote.
The ruling upholds the state’s ban on guns in most of the “sensitive places” legislators listed in the law, including: zoos, parks, beaches, playgrounds and recreational facilities, libraries, museums, places that serve alcohol, entertainment facilities, casinos, medical offices, public transit, within 100 feet of public gatherings, and private homes and businesses not open to the public.
The judges also upheld the law’s requirement that permit applicants provide four references attesting to their good character.
The Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the law’s challengers, said in a statement its members are reviewing the decision “with our objective unchanged: to end New Jersey’s immoral and unconstitutional carry bans.”
“While today’s ruling offers a partial but important recognition of our position and acknowledges serious defects in the State’s laws, it does not go nearly far enough,” the statement read. “FPC remains committed to proving — when this case moves to final judgment — that these restrictions are an assault on peaceable people and must be struck down permanently.”
Scott Bach is executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, another group that challenged the law. He described the ruling as “a mixed decision that splits the baby on what is supposed to be a bedrock fundamental right.”
“It undermines the Constitutionally guaranteed right-to-carry, and this approach will ultimately wind up in the trash bin of history,” Bach said in a statement.
The group also specifically lamented the carry ban on public transportation, saying it blocks self-defense rights “in one of the areas where they are needed most.”
 Historic tradition

Much of the gun owners’ fight against the new law was rooted in a June 2022 landmark decision, known as Bruen, in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down New York’s requirement that gun owners show “proper cause” to obtain carry permits.
That decision toppled such requirements nationally, including in New Jersey, which had long barred most gun owners from taking their firearms outside their home or business unless they could prove they had a “justifiable need” to do so.
Bruen rooted its reasoning in the nation’s “historical tradition” of gun rights. In the majority’s 139-page ruling, Krause documented over dozens of pages the historical tradition of gun regulations going back more than five centuries to early England, and later colonial America, the nation’s founding, the antebellum period, and the Reconstruction era.
“Throughout our Nation’s history, the People have time and time again opted to limit the use of firearms at specific venues set aside for civic purposes, namely, governmental and democratic functions, and public places akin to the fairs and markets of old,” Krause wrote.
She added: “By imposing permitting requirements and restricting when and where firearms can be carried, our democratically elected leaders acknowledge that there are tradeoffs between the protections of the Second Amendment and fellow citizens’ enjoyment of functional government and a host of other constitutionally enshrined rights, including the right to speak, worship, protest, and vote.”
Krause seemed frustrated to be framing their consideration of the case in a historical context, noting that elected officials who have balanced gun-carry rights with public safety protections considered “modern circumstances, and the desires of the People today.”
“It is ironic that we, who are neither elected officials nor historians, may not consider that balancing but only the extent to which it resembles the balancing of legislatures in bygone eras,” Krause wrote. “Nevertheless, we have done our best to distill the principles of our Nation’s tradition of firearm regulation from the available historical record, and what we have found convinces us that New Jersey’s law, at least in part, continues that tradition.”
Krause noted that the world is far different than it was when colonial lawmakers wrote the Constitution. Firearm technology has advanced, population density has increased, and gun violence has risen and become more lethal, she wrote. Mass shootings now happen almost daily, she added.
“Our society has evolved considerably since the Nation’s earliest days. Many of the ‘general societal problem[s]’ that contemporary firearm regulations aim to address did not exist during the Founding and Reconstruction eras,” she wrote.
The legal fight dates back to December 2022, when Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law and gun owners almost immediately sued to block it.
A federal judge in Camden in early 2023 suspended many of the law’s provisions, but the appellate court quickly paused her injunction, pending appeal. That allowed the state to enforce much of the law, including the sensitive places restrictions.
Wednesday’s ruling clears the way for the state to continue enforcing the law. Platkin said he would issue guidance to law enforcement officers so that they’re clear on what the ruling means, and which restrictions remain in place and which do not.
If the gun owners press their cause further, the case ultimately could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, where a conservative majority rules.
Gun advocates instead should “just work to actually reduce gun violence in our state,” Platkin said.
But he’s not worried about the law’s fate if the legal battle continues, saying there’s “a clear historical practice supporting what the statute does, and we have shown that time and time again.”
“As you read through a very lengthy and detailed and I think very well-reasoned opinion, I think it shows that under the Bruen framework, these types of common-sense restrictions passed by a democratically elected legislature consistent with restrictions placed by democratically elected bodies for, in some cases, centuries, can continue to remain in effect,” Platkin said.

(Infographic courtesy of the New Mexico Health Care Authority)New data from the New Mexico Department of Health shows a 9% rise in suicide deaths in the state last year. According to a news release on Wednesday, the state had 512 suicides in 2024, 42 more than in 2023.
Health officials told Source NM the data is provisional and was calculated internally. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet issued 2024 suicide data.
Firearms factored into 60% of the suicide deaths in New Mexico, a data point that highlights “how many lives we could have saved with reduced access to lethal means,” Clairie Miller, the health department’s lead suicide prevention coordinator, told Source NM. “One huge misconception about suicide prevention is that if someone doesn’t have access to a firearm, they’ll just go die by suicide another way. That is not true; that is a myth. So by reducing access to lethal means, that gives us an opportunity, that provides hope, that gives us an opportunity for resources and to get this person the support that they need.”
The health department also provides free gun locks.

According to the 2024 data, white New Mexicans had the highest rate of suicide death (29.4 deaths per 100,000 residents); followed by American Indian Alaskan Native (26.2 deaths per 100,000 residents). In addition, the Hispanic suicide rate increased by 27% over the past 10 years.
The department in January reported that New Mexico’s suicide rates for women and Indigenous people had dropped steeply in 2023, and that the overall suicide rate for the state had dropped by 9% that year.
The new figures reset New Mexico at its 10-year average, Miller said. The state has mostly consistently ranked fifth in the nation, she said, adding that the top and bottom states for suicide tend to stay the same. The states with the lowest suicide rates tend to be at sea-level, while the ones with higher rates are at a higher elevation.
“Is that the determining factor?” she said. “Absolutely not. It can be a number of things, but studies have shown that behavioral health medications and physical health medication have a better effect at sea level.” While “there hasn’t been a lot of research done on this in about the last 10 years, I’m hoping that it picks that up again, because it is very promising at really showing us what we could do differently to support our communities.”
The new data released by the state Wednesday coincides with National Suicide Prevention Month in September.
“One thing that I think is really important, particularly in New Mexico, is cultural awareness when it comes to mental health and suicide prevention,” Miller said. “And the acknowledgement that throughout one’s lifespan, there is not a time that suicide isn’t an option. We can’t start thinking that our elders or our grandparents would never be thinking about suicide. We can’t think that our kiddos would never think about suicide. We have to acknowledge that throughout the lifespan, this is a potential, and there is not one time in our lives when we shouldn’t be talking about it.”

(Photo by Matt Rourke/The Associated Press)Two days after Gov. Ron DeSantis once again called on the Florida Legislature to allow the open carrying of firearms, a three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that the law banning open carry is unconstitutional.
“No historical tradition supports Florida’s Open Carry Ban,” Judge Stephanie Row wrote in the opinion, joined by judges Lori Rowe and M. Kemmerly Thomas.
“To the contrary, history confirms that the right to bear arms in public necessarily includes the right to do so openly. That is not to say that open carry is absolute or immune from reasonable regulation. But what the State may not do is extinguish the right altogether for ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens.”
Florida is one of just a handful of states that ban open carry, and the only conservative-leaning one. That’s angered Second Amendment enthusiasts, who have become frustrated that the GOP-led Legislature has refused to repeal the law, passed in 1987.
The case was brought by Stan McDaniels, a Republican candidate for Escambia County Commission who was arrested in downtown Pensacola on July 4, 2022, with a loaded handgun tucked into his pants using an inside-the-waistband holster.
According to a police report, McDaniels was waving at vehicles with one hand with a copy of the U.S. Constitution in the other hand when law enforcement officers arrested him.
At the time, McDaniels was reported to have been cooperative, saying that he wanted to take his case to the Supreme Court. Before trial, he moved to dismiss the charge and to have the open carry ban declared unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.
Following a hearing, the trial court denied his motion, but certified the question to the First District. McDaniels was convicted as charged and sentenced to probation and community service. The court stayed his sentence pending his appeal.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said in a posting on social media that his office “fully supports the Court’s decision.”
“This is a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians,” he said. “As we’ve all witnessed over the last few days, our God-given right to self-defense is indispensable.”
“The Republican Party of Florida stands firm in defending our constitutional rights, and today’s decision underscores that commitment,” added Evan Power, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, in a written statement. “The court made clear: Florida cannot extinguish the rights of ordinary, law-abiding citizens. We applaud this decision and stand with millions of Floridians in support of the Second Amendment.”
Senate resistance
Despite verbal support by DeSantis for the Legislature to repeal Florida’s ban on open carry, the Florida Senate in particular has proven resistant to such a change.
During the 2023 legislative session, then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo (R-Naples) said she didn’t support repealing the law because the Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA) didn’t want it.
Ben Albritton (R-Wauchula) succeeded Passidomo as Senate President last November. He also opposed a repeal, saying he didn’t want to cross the FSA. “I trust my law enforcement officials,” he said. “That’s where I stand.”
The Phoenix has reached out to the Florida Sheriffs Association for comment. We will update this story if we receive a response.

A bill allowing Lyft and Uber drivers to unionize was sent to the governor’s desk  this week after it was tied to an insurance bill that benefits both companies. 


California ride-hailing drivers just won a crucial round in their pursuit of the right to unionize, but the political drama around the process and among the state’s drivers groups raises plenty of questions about what comes next.
Lawmakers sent Assembly Bill 1340 to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, but it’s merely a formality. The governor had already expressed support for the legislation in a deal he announced with Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas at the end of August. 
The state’s top politicians tied the unionization bill to Senate Bill 371, which is backed by Uber and Lyft and is also expected to pass this week. It drastically lowers the amount of uninsured and underinsured insurance coverage Uber and Lyft are required to provide, which they argue inflates costs for both drivers and passengers. In exchange, the ride-hailing giants dropped their opposition to the unionization bill.
Critics of the deal say it mostly benefits the ride-hailing companies, which in 2020 wrote and passed a ballot proposition to keep drivers classified as independent contractors. Both firms are likely to drive a hard bargain with a drivers union, experts say.
“I think it’s a sign of California politics that these large tech companies are literally getting their cake and eating it, too,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Irvine who focuses on labor and inequality.
Uber called the deal a “compromise,” but a spokesperson would not answer CalMatters’ question about whether the company commits to bargaining in good faith if the drivers vote to form a union. Lyft also expressed support for the deal, but a spokesperson for the company would not comment on the unionization bill. 
There’s even more political intrigue surrounding the unionization bill: A new lawsuit filed by Rivas’s former press secretary, Cynthia Moreno, alleges Rivas made a deal with the Service Employees International Union over the unionization bill in exchange for its support for the state Democrats’ redistricting effort that will go before voters in November. 
Maya Polon, a spokesperson for SEIU California, said “the allegations are completely unfounded.” A spokesperson for Rivas said the speaker would not comment but sent a statement from Lia Lopez, chief administrative officer for Assembly rules: “This complaint is a total fabrication.”
The mention in the lawsuit aside, the political maneuvering surrounding the two bills and the dissent among drivers groups already present complications as California becomes the second state behind Massachusetts to allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize.
Consumer and labor groups opposed the insurance bill, which reduces the ride-hailing companies’ coverage requirement for crashes involving uninsured and underinsured motorists from $1 million to $60,000 per person and $300,000 per incident. They said it shifts the burden and potential remaining liability to consumers and possibly the state. 
Opponents of the bill had included the California Federation of Labor Unions. But when CalMatters asked Lorena Gonzalez, who leads the group, why she wanted the insurance bill tied to the unionization bill, she said only that her group “supports every effort to give more workers a voice on the job and a chance to collectively bargain.”
CalMatters also asked the same questions of McGuire and Rivas, as well as of Assemblymember Marc Berman, the Palo Alto Democrat who co-authored the unionization bill. They did not respond. 
State Sen. Chris Cabaldon, the Napa Democrat who authored the insurance bill, said through a spokesperson that he expects both bills to benefit drivers and riders: “My interest in carrying SB 371 was to lower fares for people who use rideshare for necessary transportation to their jobs, school, or medical appointments.” 
The governor’s office referred CalMatters to Newsom’s statement from Aug. 29, when he announced the deal tying the two pieces of legislation together. He said then: “Labor and industry sat down together, worked through their differences, and found common ground.”
The authors of both bills have received contributions from Uber, Lyft and the SEIU, according to state records.
Drivers groups at odds
Now that the state’s 800,000 drivers have gained those rights, they will need to choose a union to represent them. 
The SEIU, which sponsored the legislation, will likely become the drivers’ representative, thanks to late amendments to the bill. They include new requirements that make it tough for fledgling drivers unions to qualify to represent drivers. One of those requirements is experience negotiating union contracts. 
“This is so outrageous,” said Nicole Moore, president of Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United, adding that because the ride-hailing industry is fairly new, even a group like hers, which has been organizing drivers since 2018, does not have that experience. Moore said her group had supported the bill and been engaging with lawmakers as well. “They pulled the rug out from under us,” she said.
A spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who co-authored the bill, referred CalMatters to the SEIU.
Polon, of SEIU California, said: “The amendments are meant to ensure fake or corporate-sponsored unions are excluded, and that any organization which is representing these workers has the ability and expertise necessary to represent these workers.”
What could be next
Jaime Lopez said he thinks a union will help improve his pay and working conditions.
Lopez, 60, drives for Uber and Lyft in Los Angeles. He was in Sacramento last week, rallying with other drivers ahead of the unionization bill’s passage. Lopez said he has been driving since 2015 and has seen his wages decline over the years. He added that he works seven days a week, doesn’t get paid when he’s sick and uses Medi-Cal for health care.  
“Maybe the union can do something about it,” he said. “I’m sure something’s going to change.”
But experts who examined the bill and its amendments are skeptical. 
“Real collective bargaining for gig drivers would mean a major shift in the business model of these companies,” said John Logan, professor and chairperson of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University. “Any improvement in conditions for gig drivers should be welcomed, but how much of a voice they’ll actually get is unclear,” Logan said. 
Dubal, the UC Irvine professor, has seen previous efforts to create what she calls “top-down company unions,” which she thinks is what’s happening here. She said language in the bill “creates a mechanism to get a single union to get dues (from drivers), plus money from the company.”
That language, says Polon of SEIU, allows drivers to negotiate “contributions or fees for a separate fund for the administration of benefits and services” including for representing drivers in cases of deactivation, or when they are kicked off the apps.
Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor at UC Santa Barbara who has written books about labor history, said sectoral bargaining — or negotiating as a group in a common occupation — makes sense for fast-food workers, for example. “It’s hard to organize McDonald’s franchises,” he said. “But this is different. Uber is a gigantic corporation with a lot of resources.” Because of that, he said a union should demand more for drivers. 
Lichtenstein did point out a provision of the legislation that he thinks will be positive: Ride-hailing companies will be required to share more concrete information about drivers, rides and earnings. There is often a wide gap between what the companies say drivers earn and what drivers and labor groups report about earnings.
“The release of data will put pressure on Uber and Lyft,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_Gig-Workers-Rally_LB3_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 13:57:23.402844

That was the conclusion of a Big Blue Bug Solutions technician who spent over two-and-a-half hours last month inside the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) Providence headquarters searching for a flying intruder.
In the Aug. 23 service inspection report obtained by Rhode Island Current, technician Michael Brooks wrote that he checked cubicles, ceilings, staircases, and any where the winged mammal may still be hiding after being spotted the night before, just as contractors were set to seal the building. But the only evidence he found were two bat droppings on the windowsill of a corner office. Brooks noted a gap in the ceiling the bat could have reentered.
“At this time, it is likely that the bat made its way back into a void space through one of the various gaps around the beams and ceilings,” Brooks wrote.
It was the third reported sighting in August. The sightings added to a list of health and safety concerns from unionized workers who are urging state officials not to renew the DCYF’s 10-year lease for the converted factory building, which expires at the end of November. DCYF has already missed a key deadline to renew the lease for another 10 years.
One bat was seen Thursday, Aug. 14, and another on Sunday, Aug. 17, which led to the building being closed for a week while pest control technicians tried to deal with the situation.
That also meant a third $350 bill for building manager Ron Varone, who’s grown frustrated over having to deal with the repeated sightings and payments to pest control technicians.
“Every time they came, they charged my credit card,” he said in a phone interview. “Bats have been in every building in downtown Providence this summer — but for some reason it’s a big deal.”
Matthew Gunnip, president of SEIU Local 580, which represents about 300 of the 460 workers in the building, wrote an email to DCYF Deputy Personnel Administrator Cheryl Mammone the night of the Aug. 22  bat sighting 
“There are people who work at DCYF who have autoimmune diseases and you are making us return to work in an unsafe and unhealthy environment!” Gunnip wrote. “I thought the company secured the building?”
But since the Aug. 23 pest control visit, no bats or bat droppings have been seen within the five-story office building in Providence’s Jewelry District, DCYF spokesperson Barb Francella confirmed in an email Tuesday afternoon.
Gunnip hasn’t heard of any unwanted flying visitors either. “It’s good news, but in the big scheme of things this bat stuff was a new and additional concern for us,” he said in an interview.
The State Properties Committee was set to consider and vote on a renewal of the office building’s lease on July 22, but the union’s pushback led the panel to pause the process while it awaited the results of an air quality test. The committee postponed another vote on July 29 in order to hold a public hearing that has yet to be scheduled as of Wednesday.
“I will let you know when it’s been scheduled,” Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, said in an email. She said the hearing would be scheduled  after normal business hours to ensure workers and DCYF administrators can equally have their say.
The lease terms required the state to sign a new lease by July 31 in order to extend it for another 10 years after it expires Nov. 30. At the July 29 meeting, the State Properties Committee members suggested that in the interim, DCYF officials could negotiate new terms with its landlord, New York-based Provident Property.
Francella said officials are in close contact with Provident Property but are unable to discuss a potential lease or its terms until a deal is approved by the State Properties Committee.
After the Aug. 22 bat sighting, Gunnip emailed Mammone a list of 40 questions ranging from concerns over use of cleaning chemicals, the last time the building’s HVAC was inspected, and perceived communication issues from state officials.
“Why did we not hear of the office closure until many of the employees we[re] already in the building?” Gunnip wrote. “Our health and safety does not seem to be prioritized.”
As of Tuesday, he said his email was still unanswered. Francella said officials are still collecting the information requested by the union.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s housing agency is quadrupling its original plans for the construction of new homes selling for far less than the state median price.
Then the agency wants to help families buy them.
The state Housing Finance and Development Authority had sought to boost the number of affordable homes on the market with a 30-house pilot program.
SC housing authority offers builders $10K per home to increase affordability

Thanks to $5 million allocated by the Legislature in the current budget, the agency now has enough for up to 130 homes, said Robert Macdonald, chief of staff at SC Housing.
“South Carolina is in a housing crisis, and this is our attempt to take a big swing at finding a solution,” said Todd Latiff, chairman of SC Housing’s governing board.
“We’re talking about people that have never had the opportunity to be homeowners having that chance,” he continued. “We’re talking about creating generational wealth for the South Carolinians that take advantage of this program. This is a big deal for our state.”
How it works
To do this, SC Housing is seeking builders willing to participate. The agency is asking construction firms to build either 1,000-square-foot homes with two bedrooms or 1,200-square-foot homes with three bedrooms. Both sizes must have two bathrooms.
The agency doesn’t put any requirements on the homes’ location. But it will give more weight to applications from builders spreading homes over more locations throughout a county or region, as opposed to a single neighborhood.
The homes must be priced at or below $175,000 for a two-bedroom and no more than $200,000 for a three-bedroom.
By comparison, the median listing price of a home in South Carolina is $350,000, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.
But the cost can be much higher depending on the region. The most expensive area to buy a home is the southern part of Beaufort, where the median price in July for homes sold was $650,000, according to the latest report from the state Association of Realtors.
In exchange for the reduced price, SC Housing will subsidize the construction with a $12,500 payment to the homebuilder for each home constructed.
SC homebuyers can get up to $10K in state aid for a down payment

The head of the Home Builders Association of South Carolina, Mark Nix, reiterated that he’s glad to see the state experimenting with ways to make homes more affordable. And the agency has taken some of the association’s feedback into account since its initial proposal.
But Nix still cautions that the program might not be financially feasible for most builders in the state.
Land is expensive, and extra fees tacked on by many cities and counties add up. A lot of municipalities also have enacted strict requirements on how small they’ll allow lots to be for new home construction, Nix said.
“There’s no way you’re going to be able to build for that in a high-growth area of a major metro,” he said.
It’s more likely that construction companies will have to find land on the outskirts to make it work. Or cities will need to make concessions for builders of these projects.
The agency began taking applications from interested homebuilders Aug. 22. They have through the end of September. The agency will announce the chosen builders in October.
Adding to the affordability of the homes, SC Housing will provide eligible homebuyers with $25,000 in forgivable down payment.
To be eligible, a family’s annual income can’t exceed $127,200.
The state also will require buyers to take out a 30-year mortgage from one of the state housing authority’s participating lenders.
Record lending
Even before this new homeownership effort, SC Housing’s mortgage programs have been growing. They provide loans to buyers with low to moderate incomes at interest rates below the national average.
“We’ve all heard the real estate market slowing down. There’s a couple houses in my neighborhood that usually would have sold in 24 hours that have been on the market for a couple months now,” Macdonald said. “But our volume continues to increase.”
Macdonald estimates they’ll end the calendar year with about $400 million in total mortgage loans, up about 10% over last year.
“Our mission is to open doors, literally and figuratively,” said Richard Hutto, SC Housing’s executive director. “We are proud to be a reliable resource for South Carolinians who might otherwise be locked out of the housing market due to cost barriers or limited access to credit.”
Affordable rentals
In addition to home ownership, SC Housing also works to increase the availability of affordable rental housing across the Palmetto State. That’s largely through a pair of state and federal income tax incentives to developers willing to build apartment complexes with lower rental rates.
SC lays plans to rebuild or repair an estimated 900 homes damaged by Hurricane Helene

Last month, the state’s five-member fiscal oversight board chaired by Gov. Henry McMaster approved six projects: two new apartment complexes and improvements to four existing complexes. All must offer affordable rents for another 30 years.
The new complexes include 180 units west of Greenville and 76 units in northeast Columbia, on the site of an existing complex operated by the city’s housing authority.
The agency vets projects based on their financial viability as well as multiple other factors, including proximity to amenities such as pharmacies, health care, grocery stores, and schools, according to Lee Ann Watson, the agency’s attorney.
SC Housing expects to seek approval for about 10 more projects by February 2026, Watson said.
The agency’s ability to finance and offer tax credits for these projects is federally regulated.
In 2024, SC Housing had the capacity for 14 projects across the state — 11 new complexes and three renovated complexes with a total of about 950 units.
This is of particular importance because about half of all renters in the state spend more than 30% of their income on rent each month, according to a 2023 housing study by the agency.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/new-home-construction-1-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 13:57:23.402844

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Jamie Lucke)DANVILLE — The Kentucky Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about whether discussions of government business conducted via private cell phones are subject to the state’s open records law.
A lawyer for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources Commission defended its refusal to comply with an open records request in 2021 for any text and email communications by private phones in which Fish and Wildlife commissioners discussed official business. 
The state Court of Appeals ruled against the department, saying that electronic communications about government business even on private phones are subject to the Open Records Act.
Excluding all text messages on personal cell phones, the appeals court said, “would surely operate to encourage the use of personal electronic devices and place vital public records beyond the reach of citizens” — a concern raised Wednesday by Justice Robert B. Conley.
Conley asked what would keep officials who want to avoid public scrutiny from “just doing public business on their phones” if such communications are, as Fish and Wildlife argues, exempt from the open records law.
Jan West, the attorney for Fish and Wildlife, said “that’s the issue” but said that is not what happened in the case before the court.
Justice Conley replied, “What’s to keep other people from down the road doing that?”

West said government agencies would have to advise officials and employees not to conduct government business on their private devices and provide them with government devices and accounts.
But attorney Michael Abate, representing the Kentucky Open Government Coalition, predicted “the destruction of transparency in the commonwealth” if some electronic communications about government business are no longer considered public records.
Abate likened the use of private cell phones to conduct government business to moving records from a government file cabinet to a file cabinet in a private home. They’re still public records, subject to the open records act, he said. 
In their questioning, the justices explored how technological advances have changed communication and expressed concerns about the privacy of personal devices.

Justice Angela McCormick Bisig suggested that text messages have become the “modern day water cooler.” 
West, the lawyer for Fish and Wildlife, raised the specter of governments being forced to comb through thousands of cell phone messages and the threat to individual privacy.
Abate disagreed with the water cooler analogy, saying that texting is “a way to communicate in writing.”
He also tried to soothe fears that private phones would be seized and searched in response to open records requests. Compliance with the open records law has always depended on individuals in government doing the right thing and responding in good faith to open records requests, Abate said. Also, the law has long shielded communications of a private or confidential nature from release under the open records law.
He stressed, however, that exempting texts from the open records act — by court ruling or legislative action — would invite officials to conduct public business outside public view.
Amicus briefs asking the court to overturn the Court of Appeals decision and rule in Fish and Wildlife’s favor were filed by the University of Kentucky and Attorney General Russell Coleman. Coleman’s brief was also on behalf of Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell, Auditor Allison Ball, Secretary of State Michael Adams and Treasurer Mark Metcalf.
The attorney general’s brief argues that the General Assembly has yet to set a standard for which records on a private device must be disclosed.
Abate said the 1976 open records law is expansive and has been interpreted to include evolving technology, including faxes, email and data bases.
He said the General Assembly has considered exempting text messages from the open records act but the proposals “failed largely because of public backlash.”
The Supreme Court is meeting Wednesday and Thursday at Centre College in Danville, where Centre students and students from nearby schools have been invited to observe.

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor on Wednesday recommended that state regulators deny AES Indiana’s request for a $193 million base rate increase — instead proposing a $21 million reduction in current rates.
The agency’s conclusions come after a three-month legal and technical review of testimony and exhibits in the pending case, which is before the powerful Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
Freshly appointed Counselor Abby Gray said AES “has not demonstrated sufficient evidence” for a hike, noting that the utility filed its ask less than 14 months after nabbing approval in a previous rate case.
“My team is recommending additional reductions that would reduce the utility’s current rates and help lessen the burden on ratepayers,” Gray continued, in a news release.
The OUCC on Tuesday filed testimony from 11 agency experts. The agency recommends that:

AES’s monthly customer service charge be cut from $17 to $11.25. The utility wants to raise it to $20.
The authorized return on equity be reduced from 9.9% to 8.5%. AES has asked for an increase to 10.7%.
More than 100 “phantom hires” in the utility’s budget be eliminated. AES wants to charge ratepayers to fill 105 open roles that one filing described as “continually vacant” with “costs that are consistently not incurred.”
Proposed expenses for depreciation, operations and maintenance be decreased and vegetation control costs be kept flat.

Electric Division Director Brian Latham — the lead witness — said AES’ case-in-chief “appears to simply give lip service to affordability while focusing on shareholder returns.” He noted that residential customers pay 25% more this year than in 2023.
AES’ rebuttal testimony is due Oct. 7.
Also included in the OUCC’s filings were more than 6,800 written comments from AES customers and other stakeholders.
AES Indiana takes next step to stop using coal, convert to natural gas by 2026

The agency has gotten “significant” numbers of written comments in recent rate cases for other investor-owned utilities, but “no recent individual rate case has produced as many as the OUCC has received in this docket,” External Affairs Specialist Ashley Bishop testified.
Another 89 AES customers spoke — all in opposition — of about 500 attendees to four public hearings held around Marion County, according to her filing. The OUCC also received about 870 complaints about AES.
“We received thousands of consumer comments in this case, highlighting serious hardships many customers are facing,” Gray said, “and I want to thank the individuals who took time to submit comments either in writing or at the IURC’s public hearings.”
Citizens Action Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for ratepayers, also filed testimony urging denial and calling for greater affordability.
“The Commission should take strong action to protect residential ratepayers experiencing inexcusably poor service at increasingly unaffordable rates,” Program Director Ben Inskeep said in a separate news release. They have “grown beyond exasperated with AES Indiana’s persistent billing and autopay issues, the woefully inadequate customer service, and overall response to AES Indiana’s mismanaged billing and autopay systems.”
After AES files its rebuttals, an IURC evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin Nov. 3. A final order is expected in the spring.

LANL will begin the venting of a radioactive gas on Sept. 13, 2025 after approval of the plan from New Mexico environment officials. (Courtesy of LANL)Los Alamos National Laboratory will start venting radioactive gas on Sept. 13 to release pressure from legacy waste containers, officials said Tuesday. The announcement followed  state environment officials’ approval of the plan on Monday.
Over the next two weeks, LANL aims to vent four waste containers filled with tritium and hazardous waste that it packed in 2007 and left at the lab’s legacy waste disposal site, called Area G. In 2016, a laboratory audit found the containers had been packed incorrectly and posed a threat of exploding.
Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear power and weapons. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin. Tritium is only considered hazardous in large quantities from inhalation, skin absorption or consumed in tritiated water – when tritium replaces the hydrogen molecules in water.
New Mexico Environment Department’s conditional approval came after pressure from federal officials urging the state in a recent letter to finalize a decision and pushback from anti-nuclear and Indigenous groups about the proposal.
“The operation is scheduled to take place over a two-week period and avoids impacting neighboring Pueblo Feast Days,” LANL’s Tuesday notice stated. “It also considers weather conditions to ensure activities occur at the best and safest time possible.”
Tewa Women United and other groups raised concerns that the federal government based its tritium exposure levels of 10 millirem — a measure of radiation dose — on men, and did not take into account the impact on pregnant women and young children.
Based on those concerns, the state will require a “hard stop” limit at 6 millirem, versus LANL’s proposed limit of 8 millirem.
Chenoa Scippio (Navajo/Santa Clara), the environmental justice project coordinator at Tewa Women United, told Source NM the group is still concerned about the potential impacts for pregnant people, noting that tritium can pass through the placental barrier.
“When it comes to the knowledge that’s shared between the labs or the government and the community, it really puts the burden onto the community to research these things to find out what it does to the body to find out how it impacts the land and water,” Scippio said. “That’s not transparency.”
Scippio said people concerned about exposure should stay indoors during the weekend venting sessions.
“That’s really the best we can offer, which is unfortunate,” she said.
Representatives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state environment department will be onsite to view the venting process, officials told Source NM on Monday.

Free.,"In D.C., a moped on the ground, an SUV full of US Marshals and a mystery",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dc-moped-ground-suv-full-us-marshals-and-mystery,,"WASHINGTON — A siren blared down one of Washington, D.C.’s busiest thoroughfares. And then, a loud noise. Residents in nearby apartment buildings peered through windows and from balconies to find a dark-colored SUV bumped up against a moped lying on the ground. A dog walker called 911 to report the incident before it became apparent that the unmarked vehicle belonged to federal law enforcement, when men in U.S. Marshals flak vests exited.The rear driver-side tire on the Chevy Tahoe had completely blown and the Marshals struggled to find a jack and spare while a uniformed Washington Metropolitan Police Department officer stood guard.Bystanders pulled out phones to record and heckled. “Shame, shame, shame,” one repeatedly yelled. Another from a nearby apartment balcony screamed “Nazis!” Eyewitnesses began exchanging bits and pieces of what they said they saw, that the driver of the moped fled the scene.“He didn’t get away though, did he? He’s down there in custody,” a U.S. Marshal responded, gesturing to where the driver ran. The incident was like so many that have played out on the streets of Washington since Aug. 11, when President Donald Trump declared a federal crime emergency in the District of Columbia: A detainee is taken away by federal agents, often with local law enforcement standing by, and with little information provided to the public.On the night of Sept. 3, a States Newsroom reporter witnessed and recorded most of the incident at 14th and N streets NW. U.S. Marshals and Homeland Security Investigations agents detain a man at the intersection of 14th and N streets NW in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. (Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)  Earlier this summer, Trump ordered National Guard troops and Marines to the streets of Los Angeles as his administration launched an immigration crackdown, muddling the messages on violent crime and immigration status. In recent days Trump has threatened to send National Guard troops to Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, New Orleans, Portland and other Democratic-led cities. As of Monday, the administration announced a wave of federal immigration agents were headed to Chicago.“This is a big issue,” said Mike Fox, legal fellow for the Cato Institute’s Project on Criminal Justice.Fox, whose think tank advocates for limited federal government, told States Newsroom in an interview about Trump’s federalization of law enforcement in cities that he believes the strategy breaks down trust.“You have unidentified federal agents coming in, seizing people's property, but more importantly, seizing people. It undermines the very premise upon which community policing is supposed to work,” Fox said.Despite multiple inquiries, States Newsroom was not able to get any additional information on the man taken into custody.Moped drivers On the night of Sept. 3, as U.S. Marshals continued to struggle with the tire, Homeland Security Investigations agents arrived a short time later with a detainee in the back of a separate unmarked SUV. Eight Marshals and Homeland Security Investigations agents surrounded the man to switch his restraints to a new set with chains around his waist and between his ankles. HSI is a law enforcement agency within U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, under the Department of Homeland Security.News outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post and Bellingcat have reported on the detainments of moped drivers in the district, and publicly crowd-sourced alerts from online monitor “Stop ICE Alerts” have included sightings of federal agents stopping mopeds.

The 30-day federal crackdown has drawn widespread criticism and protests from district residents. District Mayor Muriel Bowser, however, has agreed to keep federal law enforcement on the streets beyond Trump’s emergency, which ends Wednesday.Moped drivers who run food deliveries are a routine sight on D.C. streets, and many are from Latin America. Until recently, it wasn’t uncommon to see groups of moped food delivery drivers along 14th Street NW before a day’s work or on breaks between orders.Law enforcement mumA States Newsroom reporter saw the man being taken into custody but his name and his citizenship or immigration status could not be determined, nor the reason why police chased him. Officers on the scene did not respond to shouted questions.The U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security Investigations have not provided information requested by States Newsroom regarding the incident, including whether the detainee was wanted on criminal charges or what happened to the moped that was left behind at the scene on a nearby sidewalk.U.S. Marshals are officers of the federal courts who usually apprehend fugitives and manage or sell seized assets. In January, Trump directed numerous federal law enforcement agencies, including the Marshals Service, to “investigate and apprehend illegal aliens.” States Newsroom has filed Freedom of Information Act requests with both agencies for body camera footage and reports about the incident and apparent impact between the SUV and moped, among other records.Similarly, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department did not provide information on the incident, despite its presence on the scene.When asked by States Newsroom if the agency made any records of assisting federal agents that night, MPD spokesperson Tom Lynch responded, “There is no publicly available document for this matter.”‘It should scare people across the country’Cato’s Fox said information on the federal crackdown in the district is scarce. “And that should scare everyone in D.C. It should scare Congress. It should scare people across the country. This is not a D.C.-specific issue,” Fox said. The American Civil Liberties Union’s D.C. Director Monica Hopkins told States Newsroom in a statement that “there are huge gaps and limitations in the accountability that is available to people” when it comes to federal law enforcement.“Despite the Trump administration’s attempts at fear and intimidation, everyone in D.C. has rights, regardless of who they are and their immigration status,” Hopkins said.The ACLU-DC is urging Congress to pass legislation barring federal immigration authorities from wearing face coverings and obscuring their agencies or identification when engaged in enforcement actions.The Homeland Security Investigations agents and U.S. Marshals at the incident witnessed by States Newsroom did not have their faces covered and were wearing vests identifying their respective agencies.However, agents carrying out detainments in balaclava-style face coverings or bandanas and plain clothes, donning vests that only say “police,” have been witnessed and recorded by members of the public and journalists.Later that nightAs the scene wrapped up in Northwest D.C. on Sept. 3, immigrant advocates on bicycles arrived.The volunteers said they were with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid group, a network in the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area collecting information on immigration arrests and raids. The group runs a hotline for arrest reports and for family members seeking relatives who may have been detained.States Newsroom contacted the mutual aid organization but could not obtain any details about the Sept. 3 incident.Roughly an hour after police cleared that night, a States Newsroom reporter witnessed a small group of people surrounding the moped. A few tried to start the engine and removed at least one item from the under-seat storage compartment.The moped was no longer there the following morning.U.S. Marshals and the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to questions about the whereabouts of the moped.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-10 12:57:15.402796

Terry Murrell, who has served as Western Iowa Tech Community College’s president since 2011, will retire on May 15, 2026, according to a news release. He originally started at the Sioux City college in 2007 as vice president of instruction and student services.
“Serving alongside our faculty, staff, and students has been one of the greatest privileges of my career,” Murrell said in the release. “Together, we have navigated challenges, celebrated milestones, and most importantly, made a meaningful difference in the lives of our students and the communities we serve.”

Murrell’s leadership has “left a lasting impact” on the community college and the region, the release stated, by enhancing both student success and the college’s presence in area communities and boosting partnerships.
During his time at the college, Murrell brought athletics to campus as well as a food pantry and health center, and strengthened mental health services, the release stated. Graduation rates tripled during his presidency and he helped the college craft new mission and value statements and branding.

He also took responsibility in 2024 for problems with its international education program, which led to the college settling in court with two groups of students from Brazil and Chile who alleged the college conspired with area companies to engage in human trafficking.
Western Iowa Tech paid a combined $5.3 million in two settlements after the college was accused of bringing in international students and pushing them to work at area meat packing plants, including plants run by Tur-Pak Foods and Royal Canin USA. The college then took money from students’ paychecks to reimburse itself for program costs, according to the lawsuits.
As the Iowa Capital Dispatch previously reported, Murrell said in July 2024 he and the college “got too deep into something we were not overly familiar with, and we didn’t do a good job.”
Western Iowa Tech will join other Iowa colleges in its search for a new president, including Des Moines Area Community College and Iowa State University. According to the release, the community college board of directors will share details of a transition plan as they develop, and will begin the new president selection process later this year.

(Courtesy of New Jersey Governor's Office)The New Jersey Department of Health has authorized pharmacies and pediatricians statewide to give COVID-19 vaccines to anyone 6 months or older, a move meant to protect access to the shots after federal health officials last month announced new eligibility restrictions limiting them to people over 65 or with other health problems.
Acting Health Commissioner Jeff Brown issued an executive directive Monday denouncing the “unfounded and unsupported barriers” the federal Food and Drug Administration created in rolling back vaccine access.
The feds’ restrictions are at odds with guidance from groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians, which have recommended widespread COVID-19 immunizations and endorsed their safety, Brown noted. Since the coronavirus outbreak began in 2020, COVID-19 vaccines typically have been available to anyone six months or older.
“This is about equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which has been proven to prevent serious illness and hospitalization,” Brown said in a statement. “Especially as we enter cold and flu season and as students head back to school, New Jerseyans are reminded to stay up to date on all recommended vaccinations.”
Novneet Sahu, the department’s deputy commissioner of public health services, also issued a standing order Monday authorizing pharmacists and other pharmacy staff to administer COVID-19 vaccines without a prescription to anyone 3 and older. Children under 3 can get immunizations from their pediatricians.
Gov. Phil Murphy said the orders are meant to ensure that anyone who wants a COVID-19 vaccine can get one in New Jersey. The administration also urged health insurance carriers to cover the shots’ costs free of charge to ensure widespread access.

Bo Mitchell.The four Democrats vying for a GOP-held Middle Tennessee congressional seat agreed that December’s special election was about serving as a check on the Trump administration.
But each one thought only they were the electable choice.
Primary voters will vote in a special election on Oct. 7 for the Tennessee 7th U.S. Congressional District triggered by the resignation of Mark Green.
On Tuesday, a coalition of progressive groups including TIRRC Votes, The Equity Alliance, The Central Labor Council and Planned Parenthood held a forum at Nashville’s First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill, with businessman Darden Copeland and Nashville state Reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell. 
Behn — who has been endorsed by Indivisible, a progressive political organizing group — said the only way a Democrat could win the seat was with energized turnout, which she could deliver by mobilizing voters with her progressive policies.
The 7th District’s primary election serves as the latest fight between the progressive wing of the party and moderate Democrats who vastly differ on how to win future elections.

Copeland, a first time candidate, said that whoever won the primary would face “a math problem,” mentioning he felt the need to run for the seat but didn’t specify how he would solve the problem. 
Since the district was redrawn in 2022, Green has defeated Democrats in back-to-back elections by 20%, with the Cook Political Report rating the seat as a “solid Republican.”
Dixie, a resident of the district’s North Nashville area, said winning the election would be about building a coalition and nominating someone who has lived the issues of the district.
Mitchell, a seven-term lawmaker from Dickson, said the race was about reaching out to rural voters, listening to them and convincing them to “quit voting against their self-interests.”
Few issues separate candidates from each other and Trump in Tennessee Congressional Debate

The district encompasses the western half of Middle Tennessee before taking a claw-like shape out of Nashville and Williamson County.
On the Republican side, nearly a dozen candidates are running for the nomination.
Americans for Prosperity Tennessee and SuperTalk 99.7 hosted a debate with Dickson state Rep. Jody Barrett, Brentwood state Rep. Gino Bulso, Franklin state Rep. Lee Reeves, and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, the four candidates polling highest in a recent survey by AFP Tennessee. Very few issues separated the GOP candidates, all agreeing that their job in Congress would be to support President Trump.
The general election is on December 2.

Tim Moore, a Republican from North Carolina's 14th District that includes parts of Charlotte, speaks on the U.S. House floor about the murder of Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail. (Screengrab of C-SPAN video)North Carolina’s 10 U.S. House Republicans are calling for the immediate removal of the magistrate who released a repeat offender charged with murdering a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte light rail.
The Aug. 22 attack has drawn national and international attention since Friday’s release of surveillance footage. It shows 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska getting on the train in Charlotte’s South End, sitting down, and minutes later, the man behind her standing up and stabbing her in the neck.
Police charged DeCarlos Brown Jr. with first-degree murder.
He had been free since January on a written promise to appear in court for a misdemeanor charge of misusing 911.
Multiple media outlets report Brown faced 14 prior charges dating back over a decade. He spent five years in prison for a 2014 robbery with a firearm. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Brown with causing death on a mass transportation system. Federal officials could seek the death penalty. The 34-year-old Brown will undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
“By releasing a repeat violent offender on nothing more than his written promise to appear, Magistrate [Teresa] Stokes displayed a willful failure to perform the duties of her office and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,” wrote the congressional representatives in a Sept. 9 letter.
“North Carolina’s justice system failed Iryna Zarutska,” said U.S. Rep. Tim Moore of North Carolina’s 14th District which includes parts of Charlotte and its suburbs, such as Gastonia. “Judge Stokes had the chance to protect the public and chose not to. It’s clear that she’s unfit to hold this consequential position and should be removed from the bench immediately.”
The letter is addressed to Chief District Court Judge Roy Wiggins, who has the authority to initiate removal proceedings.
In addition to Moore, the letter is signed by Reps. Gregory F. Murphy, M.D. (NC-3), Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Addison P. McDowell (NC-6), David Rouzer (NC-7), Mark Harris (NC-8), Richard Hudson (NC-9), Pat Harrigan (NC-10), Chuck Edwards (NC-11), and Brad Knott (NC-13).
Moore has also co-sponsored legislation seeking to end cashless bail.
State Auditor Dave Boliek waded into the matter Tuesday announcing that the Office of the State Auditor will formally investigate the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS).
“The recent lawlessness and violence that have taken place on Charlotte’s public transportation raise serious questions about the security measures in place. We will investigate CATS and examine its public safety contracts and operations,” said Boliek.
The auditor’s office has notified Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Metropolitan Transit Commission leadership, and CATS leadership that the investigation will begin immediately.

President Donald Trump keyed in on the murder on social media Tuesday saying that the policies of Democrat-run cities have left criminals to pray on innocent people.
“We have to respond with force and strength. We have to be vicious just like they are. It’s the only thing they understand,” pledged Trump.
Figures show that homicides are down in many large cities since spiking in 2020 amid the pandemic.
Lyles, a Democrat, has called the attack on Zarutska “horrific and senseless.”
In response, the Charlotte mayor has pledged stronger policing across the transit system and increased fare enforcement.
Lyles is seeking a fifth term in office. On Tuesday night, she won a crowded Democratic primary with more than 70% of the ballots cast in the mayoral race. She did not address the media after her decisive win.
Lyles will face Republican Terrie Donovan and Libertarian Rob Yates in November.
Crime prevention and public safety will be top issues for the candidates.

Tim Walz speaks after the end of the special session in June Tuesday, June 10, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz made it clear he intends to run for an unprecedented third four-year term in front of a group of  100 or so Democratic donors Tuesday, according to two people who were there. 
In his speech at the Iron Ranger bar in St. Paul, Walz said something to the effect of “you’re all here making contributions, and you probably know I’m not going to run off to Mexico with your money, so look out for an announcement,” according to a source who attended the fundraiser and whose account was confirmed by another person there. 
“He made it clear he is moving in that direction,” said a person in attendance. 
The Reformer spoke to four people who were at the fundraiser or who have spoken to Walz about his plans in recent days. They were granted anonymity because they were not authorized by their employers to speak publicly.
Walz has also told several people privately but definitively that he will run again, and he will make a campaign announcement next week.
A Walz spokesman declined to comment. 
A DFL source who was at the event said Walz was thrown off by the June killing of Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was a friend and governing partner. But the recent mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, where schoolchildren were gathered for a celebratory Mass, “lit a fire in him” because he wants to provide leadership during another vulnerable moment in Minnesota history. 
Despite the advantages of incumbency, a robust fundraising operation and his own natural political skills, winning a third term won’t be easy. 
Walz would have to defend a lengthy record, during which he’s governed during some of the state’s worst crises: The pandemic and resulting academic declines; the murder of George Floyd and the uprising and rioting that followed; a spike in crime that has since subsided; emerging fiscal instability; and, finally, the political violence that took the life of Hortman and her husband Mark and badly wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. 
Another crisis has been state government’s own making: A wave of fraud in public programs is sure to be a centerpiece of the Republican campaign against him. 
Rep. Kristin Robbins, a Republican candidate for governor from Maple Grove and currently chair of the Minnesota House’s fraud prevention committee, said Walz has allowed rampant fraud in his own agencies.
“A third Walz term would be a disaster, and I’m stepping up to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Robbins said in a statement to the Reformer. “I am committed to stopping the fraud, restoring fiscal responsibility and bringing back common-sense leadership so the state works for Minnesotans, not against them.”
Scott Jensen, the 2022 GOP nominee for governor, and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive, are also running as GOP candidates. Neither immediately responded to the Reformer’s requests for comment.
Recent polling suggests that Walz remains popular with Minnesotans, but they are less pleased with the idea of him running for a third term. A June KSTP poll found that only 43% of Minnesotans surveyed say he should run again.
Despite Walz’s challenges, he has also enjoyed the highest of highs: A surprisingly easy 2022 reelection and a Democratic-Farmer-Labor trifecta that resulted in a bevy of legislative victories, from free school meals to drivers licenses for undocumented people, legal marijuana to huge investments in transportation and housing. He parlayed that record and a few high-profile national media appearances to emerge as Kamala Harris’ surprising pick to be her vice presidential nominee. 
A national media and public speaking tour earlier this year fueled speculation about a 2028 presidential run, but he’s already said he won’t run if he wins a third term.

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)Whether you have enjoyed a hike to a summit in the Green or White Mountains, fishing a cold-water trout stream, a postcard-perfect view from a highway overlook, or a glass of clean water from your tap, there’s a good chance that a U.S. Forest Service “Inventoried Roadless Area” is to thank.
But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”
Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

Asked how they thought Healey is doing as governor, 20 percent of residents said they strongly approve of her performance, 36 percent say they somewhat approve, 15 percent somewhat disapprove, 18 percent strongly disapprove, and 11 percent said they were unsure. 
The post Healey holds her head above water in new poll  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","JUST OVER HALF of Massachusetts residents approve of the job Maura Healey is doing as governor – holding steady according to a new poll – but any challengers aligning themselves with Donald Trump will have to contend with the president’s persistent deep unpopularity in the Bay State. 
In a new poll for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – 1,000 Massachusetts residents weighed in on the state and federal executives between August 11 and 18. (Topline | Crosstabs) 
Asked how they thought Healey is doing as governor, 20 percent of residents said they strongly approve of her performance, 36 percent say they somewhat approve, 15 percent somewhat disapprove, 18 percent strongly disapprove, and 11 percent said they were unsure. The credibility interval is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 
Most Massachusetts residents have an opinion on Trump’s performance, with only 4 percent unsure. And they’re more firmly opposed to the president’s actions. Some 48 percent of the respondents said they strongly disapprove, 12 percent somewhat disapprove, 18 percent somewhat approve, and 17 percent strongly approve.  
“Healey looks to me like a conventional Democrat,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling group. “She draws more cross-party support than Trump. Republicans don’t love her, but they also are not united against her the way Democrats oppose Trump.” 
Between Healey’s own base and enough independents, he said, it’s a “perfectly fine poll” for the incumbent. “It’s a long campaign with a lot to come,” he said. “But this poll on its own doesn’t feel like a warning sign.” 

Though the poll was fielded in August before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a series of moves that will limit who is eligible for COVID vaccines, Bay Staters were already holding Kennedy in generally low regard, though not quite as much as the president. The poll found 56 percent of residents disapproved of Kennedy’s performance and 34 percent approved. 
Healey last week announced that Massachusetts would chart a new path to break ties with the new federal vaccine policy.  
“The government is failing its responsibility to Americans, including Bay Staters,” Healey said. “So we’re here to say: This is not going to happen in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we will not let Donald Trump or Robert Kennedy get in the way of patients, and the care, and the treatments and the medication that they want and need.” 
Predictably for this era of hyper-partisan and nationalized politics, party affiliation was the major indicator of approval or disapproval for state and federal leadership.  
Some 42 percent of registered Republicans and independents that lean Republican – groups that largely vote the same way – strongly support Trump’s performance, 39 percent somewhat support him, 9 percent somewhat disapprove, and just 6 percent strongly disapprove. 
The polarization was even sharper among Democrats. Only 6 percent of Massachusetts Democrats or independents that lean Democratic said they strongly supported the president’s performance. Three-quarters of the Democrats and leaners strongly oppose Trump’s performance. 
The firm majority of registered Republicans and leaners are chilly to Healey’s performance overall. But while 66 percent either strongly or somewhat disapprove of her, 27 percent said they strongly or somewhat approve of her performance. 
The governor does still hold her Democratic base, with 80 percent of Democrats and leaners saying they approved of her performance. But that was somewhat softer support, split between strong approval and somewhat approving. Only 3 percent of the group said they strongly disapproved of Healey’s performance. 

Her overall numbers are still a far cry from her unusually popular predecessor, Charlie Baker, even as Trump’s first term sparked outrage in the Bay State. 
During Baker’s first run for governor, he was widely perceived as stridently partisan – a mismatch for the generally liberal Massachusetts electorate. But after toning down his pitch and winning a tight race against Attorney General Martha Coakley by less than 2 percentage points in 2014, Baker moved to the center with a Mr. Fix-It brand. 
In 2017, as midterms approached and the gubernatorial election was just a year away, Baker was viewed favorably by 67 percent of the state’s voters and held leads of at least 34 points against his three declared Democratic challengers. 
By the end of Baker’s term, his support came more from Democrats than Republicans, Koczela noted. “That’s a better formula for Baker,” he said, “since registered Republicans are such a small part of the electorate.” 
Healey’s election marked the return of one-party rule on Beacon Hill, and some political watchers mulled that there may be interest in rebalancing the state level partisan math if a strong candidate came along. 
Relatively little polling has tested out the odds of Healey’s Republican challengers, Brian Shortsleeve and Mike Kennealy, who both worked in the Baker administration and are currently criticizing each other over fundraising while going after Healey on shelter capacity, crime, and spending. A February UMass Amherst poll found Kennealy trailing Healey 40 percent to 15 percent, and Shortsleeve behind 44 percent to 12. 
“Donald Trump has a 35 percent approval rating,” Koczela noted. “Aligning with him could be helpful in winning a Republican primary but won’t help with the broader electorate. This has been the conundrum for GOP candidates in Massachusetts since Trump came on the scene.” 
In net approval – total approval minus total disapproval – Healey struggles with voters without college degrees and is barely above water with true independents and residents of Southeast Massachusetts. That region tends to be the hardest area for Democrats, Koczela said. 
Healey also seems to be a bit softer than a Democrat might like among non-white residents, which are generally reliable Democratic voters and with whom the poll shows Healey has net positives of 28 percentage points. Non-white voters in 2024 chose Kamala Harris over Trump in Massachusetts 73 percent to 25 percent, a 48-point margin. 
Though Massachusetts does not have exit polls during non-presidential years, Healey won cities and towns with heavily Latino populations by healthy margins in 2022. For instance, she won Fall River with 57 percent of the vote to Geoff Diehl’s 41 percent. 
“In 2024, Massachusetts saw a major realignment, particularly among Latino voters,” Koczela said. “This showed up in places like Lawrence, Fall River, and other Gateway Cities with Trump making major gains over past Republican candidates. Democrats would certainly hope for a strong performance among the state’s voters of color to show this was a one off, and this poll doesn’t clearly point in that direction.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — Railroads built Nebraska and helped usher in some of the state’s earliest economic benefits, ProRail Nebraska leader Bob Kuzelka told a group gathered Tuesday night at the town’s public library.
“And now they can do it again,” he said, advocating for expanded passenger rail in the state to increase transportation options and grow tourism and commercial development along rail routes. “At every stop, lots of people get on, people get off.”
Kuzelka was among a trio of speakers on the third leg of a five-stop town hall tour organized by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha and ProRail to educate Nebraskans on the possibilities and benefits of passenger rail options, gauge interest and broaden support. ProRail is associated with the Rail Passenger Association and seeks improved passenger rail and other forms of surface public transportation serving Nebraska.
The feedback the group and Juarez seek is for a legislative interim study also evaluating existing passenger rail infrastructure in Nebraska. Juarez and other advocates say they recognize the cost and that resistance by some, including state officials, signals a tough road ahead for expanded passenger rail options.

The Nebraska Department of Transportation has told the Nebraska Examiner that passenger rail currently is “not viable in the state, because the development of such a route would pose a significant cost, and there is currently no mechanism to pay for such a project with existing state revenue.”
Speakers told the group of nearly 10 people at the North Platte Library that they hope the series of town halls will shed a positive light on passenger rail. A Lincoln town hall Friday drew about 60 people. The next one is at 6 p.m. Sept 16 at the Grand Island library.
Kuzelka and Dan Bilka of All Aboard Northwest said they hope public sentiment might nudge Nebraska officials to develop a new state rail plan they said hasn’t been updated in a couple of decades.
Bilka said a goal is for Nebraska and other states to become better connected through “true interconnected national rail system.” He and other speakers advocated for Nebraska to rejoin the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission (MIPRC) to promote that goal and not get left behind.
Nebraska helped establish the regional commission, but it withdrew years ago under a legislative proposal that said membership benefits “do not outweigh the expenditure of tax dollars on dues.”
State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island has introduced legislation to rejoin the commission. Juarez told the North Platte meeting she would attend a regional passenger rail conference later this week. She said that  even though Nebraska is not a member, she was invited to attend and plans to stay updated on the issues.

“We want to do more for getting Nebraskans on track,” said Kuzelka, sporting a shirt that says, “I’d rather be on the train.”
Bilka referred to the “three E’s” in laying out what he saw as benefits of passenger rail: economic, environmental and (especially for rural communities) equity. 
Though few in number, the group engaged with comments and questions. 
Tony Peal said he was retired and enjoyed trips on the Amtrak, which is the limited passenger rail service currently offered in Nebraska. The California Zephyr route stops in Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, Holdrege and McCook on its way from Chicago to Emeryville, Calif. Nebraska stops are typically in late night early morning hours, not geared toward workers or a daily event.
But Peal called an expanded passenger rail system through other Nebraska towns such as North Platte a “pipe dream.” It would require use of Union Pacific Railroad tracks, he said, and he didn’t think the company would be involved or take on the liability.
He said he didn’t believe the population base in cities outside of Omaha and Lincoln could support the effort financially.
Macey Schroeder, 28, said she thought expanded passenger rail makes “just really common sense.”
The teacher said passenger rail was the “equity” that western Nebraska deserves. She envisions Nebraskans spending a 45-minute commute reading or working on computers instead of focusing full attention on driving a personal vehicle on a highway.
“Live your life instead of everyone having to drive themselves,” she said.

In addition to continued hiring in fiscal year 2026, plans call for a single hiring initiative in fiscal year 2027 that will feature 100 new attorneys.
The post Mass. public defender agency hires 22 new attorneys in rapid expansion appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","The Committee for Public Counsel Services has reached out to 50 law schools and hired 22 new attorneys over a 17-day span in August as it moves forward with “the largest staffing expansion in the agency’s history.”
In a mandated update filed with the Legislature, CPCS said the hires were scheduled to begin training Monday.
The Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey this summer agreed to a law requiring the CPCS Public Defender Division to hire 320 attorneys over two fiscal years. The law also granted raises to part-time bar advocate attorneys, and its passage came after some bar advocates stopped accepting cases to protest pay levels.
The supplemental budget signed by Healey included a $40 million reserve to help fund the hiring. The law also required that the hiring expansion prioritize efforts to ensure that clients are “timely represented by counsel” and directed the committee to prioritize hiring in areas “with unrepresented individuals awaiting counsel assignment, including counties with a recent history of private bar advocate work stoppages.”
Before the expansion mandate, CPCS had already hired 20 attorneys for its fall 2025 class, and the number rose to 42 with the recent additions. Nearly 80% of the expansion hires were assigned to represent indigent clients in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, according to the update, and CPCS reported that those two counties “are among the most impacted areas and where the need for counsel is most urgent.”
In addition to continued hiring in fiscal year 2026, plans call for a single hiring initiative in fiscal year 2027 that will feature 100 new attorneys and “will require a nationwide recruitment campaign targeting law schools and public interest networks across the country,” according to the update.
“This expansion represents a transformational investment in the public defense system,” CPCS said in its update. “It provides not only a significant number of additional attorneys but also the supervisory, investigative, and administrative infrastructure to sustain a modern and effective indigent defense practice. By structuring growth around proportional staffing ratios and investing in training, CPCS is helping to build a sustainable, system designed for long-term stability and long-term impact for the communities we serve.”

(Photo courtesy of Ash Hebert)Penobscot County is grappling with the largest HIV outbreak in Maine’s history. Home to Bangor, a city of roughly 32,000, the county has identified 28 new cases over nearly two years. That’s seven times the typical number for that length of time. Nearly all cases are among people who use drugs and are homeless.
Public health experts and local advocates say the outbreak is fueled by a confluence of on-the-ground factors: the sidelining and closing of programs that distributed sterile syringes to people who use drugs, a shortage of medical providers focused on HIV, and the clearing of the city’s largest homeless encampment, which upended care for newly diagnosed people living there.
But those issues may not remain local for long.
The Trump administration is pushing similar tactics nationwide. In a recent executive order, Trump called for defunding programs that engage in harm reduction — a broad term that encompasses many public health interventions, including syringe services, aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. Such efforts are sometimes controversial, with critics saying they enable illegal activity. The executive order also supports forcing homeless people off the street and into treatment. This comes after the administration cut or delayed funding for various addiction and HIV-related programs and hollowed out federal agencies focused on these topics.
The administration says its approach will increase public safety, but decades of research suggest otherwise. Many advocates and researchers warn these efforts could spark more outbreaks like the one in Bangor.
“That feels inevitable,” said Laura Pegram, director of Drug User Health for NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.
She said people who use drugs face a trifecta of risks: HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose. “Across the country, I think we’ll start to see those three things starting to be on the rise again.”
“That will be incredibly costly,” she added — in dollars and “in a real human way.”
Outbreaks that start among people who use drugs can easily spread to those who don’t.
Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, was a Bangor-area nonprofit that distributed more than half a million sterile needles a year to people who use drugs. The organization ran out of supplies repeatedly in the lead-up to the first HIV case of the current outbreak in October 2023, and it shut down in early 2025. (Photo courtesy of Amy Clark)
 An HIV outbreak
The first HIV case in Bangor’s current outbreak appeared in October 2023, well before Trump’s return to the presidency.
Puthiery Va, director of Maine’s public health department, attributed the emergence to the opioid epidemic, housing shortages, and the greater Bangor area’s sparse health care services.
Local advocates highlighted an additional, acute factor: supply shortages at the region’s largest syringe services program and its subsequent closure.
A nonprofit that provided health care and social services to people who use drugs, Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, distributed more than half a million sterile needles annually.
Like other such programs nationwide, its goal was to prevent the spread of infectious disease that can occur if people share needles to inject drugs.
However, financial struggles and mismanagement led to severe shortages in recent years. Former HEAL executive director Josh D’Alessio acknowledged such issues, telling KFF Health News, “We did run out of syringes” at times or limit how many participants could take. Several of these shortages struck in the fall of 2023, leading HEAL staffers to suggest a link to the first HIV case.
 The future of harm reduction
Research suggests a strong connection between past HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs and lack of access to sterile needles, said Thomas Stopka, an epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine.
A 2015 outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, and one in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts a few years later were curbed only after syringe services programs ramped up, he said. If such programs had existed sooner in Scott County, more than a hundred infections could have been prevented, one study suggested.
Va, who leads the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said she considers the shortage of syringe services in the Bangor area to be a factor in the outbreak but not the primary cause.
Stopka said the best practice during an outbreak “is to amplify access to sterile syringes.”
But Trump’s recent executive order links harm-reduction programs to crime, saying such efforts “only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.” The order doesn’t name syringe services programs — which have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past — but it targets “safe consumption” sites, where people can use drugs under supervision. Many advocates worry the attacks will be broader.
A letter from the nation’s leading addiction agency expanding on Trump’s executive order said federal funds cannot be used to buy syringes or drug pipes. However, that has been true for most of the past few decades. The letter did not address supporting general operating costs for syringe services programs.
Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News that the administration is committed to “addressing the addiction and overdose crisis impacting communities across our nation.” But he and spokespeople for the White House did not respond to specific questions about the administration’s stance toward syringe services.
In Bangor, some locals have raised concerns about harm reduction that echo the president’s. At a March 2024 City Council meeting — shortly after a syringe services program was newly certified by the state to operate locally — residents and business owners said they felt unsafe with the growing population of people who were homeless and using drugs. They worried syringe programs were fueling the behavior.
But research suggests syringe services programs reduce discarded needles in the community and do not increase crime. They can halve new HIV and hepatitis C cases, increase entry into addiction treatment fivefold, and save taxpayer money. They are also leading distributors of overdose reversal medications, the use of which many communities — and the Trump administration — have said they support.
The city ultimately decided the newly certified program, Needlepoint Sanctuary, could not operate in prominent public parks or squares.
In the following months, Needlepoint ran its syringe services only at the city’s largest homeless encampment, where several people had tested positive for HIV, said the group’s executive director, William “Willie” Hurley. That ended in February when the city cleared the encampment.
This summer, Needlepoint secured a private location for its syringe services but shut it down five days later when city officials raised zoning concerns.
Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor’s health department, said the city is trying to strike a balance between “making services available and what the community wants.”
“Getting the buy-in of most of the community” is “critical to the future of harm reduction,” she said.
Other cities in Maine and beyond have seen backlash result in new laws that restrict how syringe services programs operate or shutter them.
Gunderman said she is hoping to avoid that in Bangor.

 Clearing encampments
Trump’s recent executive order also calls for clearing homeless people off the street and involuntarily committing them to treatment facilities.
The administration is enacting this policy in Washington, D.C., where it has bulldozed tents and threatened homeless people with fines and jail time if they don’t leave the streets.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said people have the option to be taken to a shelter or receive addiction and mental health services.
Similar policies have taken hold nationwide in recent years, even in liberal hubs like New York and California.
Last year in Bangor, as a homeless encampment that had existed for several years grew to nearly 100 residents, business owners and locals called for its clearing.
Some advocates and social service providers warned that doing so could exacerbate the HIV outbreak and overdose crisis. At two City Council meetings in November, they explained that it would be difficult to find people they served after a clearing and that scattering newly diagnosed people could spark HIV clusters elsewhere.
“Plenty of people said you’re going to lose track of these people,” Amy Clark, a board member for the Bangor Area Recovery Network, told KFF Health News. “They did it anyway.”
 ‘I’m still alive’
Two months after clearing the encampment, the city reported not knowing the location of more than a third of the people who had lived there.
Clark said it’s not surprising that the city couldn’t connect everyone to housing or treatment. Many people distrust these services, shelters are frequently full, and treatment services are scarce. “Where exactly are these people supposed to go?” she said.
City officials stressed in Council meetings and reports that they were taking a humane approach. They ramped up social services for months leading up to the clearing, connecting people to everything from housing to storage facilities and laundry.
Gunderman, the city health director, said she knows the sweep wasn’t ideal but that neither was crowding folks in an unsanitary encampment. “It was a situation where there weren’t a lot of great answers,” she said.
Needle exchanges face municipal pushback despite state, public health backing

To help track folks from the encampment and keep them engaged in HIV treatment, the city is now using about $550,000 in opioid settlement funds to hire two case managers. (The only other local HIV medical case management program shuttered over the summer.)
“What we know from outreach we’ve been doing already is that we spend a lot of time looking for people,” Gunderman said.
Jason, who has been homeless for most of the past decade and tested positive for HIV this year, has seen that in action.
Members of what he calls his medical team have scoured the streets for hours to find his tent and remind him to take his HIV treatment shots, he said. Some picked up prescriptions and delivered them to him.
“They’ve made sure I’m taken care of,” Jason said. (KFF Health News agreed to use only his first name to protect his privacy.)
Jason believes he got the virus last year at the homeless encampment while using drugs that someone else prepared. He had tried to avoid the encampment for months. But whenever he set up his tent elsewhere, he said, police officers told him to move.
When he got the diagnosis, he thought of his uncle, who died of AIDS in the 1980s.
“It hurts to talk about,” Jason said, “but I’m still alive.”
After months of treatment, his viral load is now undetectable. Over the summer, his team helped him find housing.
But Jason is still struggling to find sterile needles regularly. He worries about others facing a shortage.
“That’s how this outbreak has been spreading more and more,” Jason said. “Every time we turn around there’s another case.”

Ron DeSantis forced upon the Legislature following the 2020 Census. It eliminated Black representation in North Florida. (Via FloridaRedistricting.gov)Although Gov. Ron DeSantis says he’s intent on pursuing a mid-decade congressional redistricting that would help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House in 2026, the majority of Floridians do not agree — and that includes a majority of Republicans.
The survey of nearly 500 Floridians of all political stripes conducted by Common Cause finds that 55% oppose the idea, with only 26% in support and  another 19% undecided.
The opposition is consistent across party lines: Among Republicans, 45% oppose the idea, with 36% supporting it and 18% having no opinion. Among political independents, 60% oppose the plan with just 14% supporting it. Among Democrats, 62% oppose the idea, with 25% supporting it.
“In very clear terms, our poll shows even Republicans in Florida do not support mid-decade redistricting,” said Amy Keith, Florida executive director of Common Cause, in a written statement. “Floridians do not want the legislature to waste their time and our taxpayer dollars trying to make our voting maps even more gerrymandered than they already are. The legislature should follow the data and stop their work on this issue. Floridians want them to focus on the real issues impacting our lives, like the cost of groceries, housing and insurance.”
Common Cause is a national watchdog organization with chapters in 35 states. It historically has supported independent redistricting, campaign finance laws, and stronger election safeguards.
Redistricting the state’s congressional map was never on DeSantis’ agenda throughout this year. That changed after Texas Republicans responded to a demand by the Justice Department to redraw their congressional map in early July. In doing so, they provided President Donald Trump with what he wanted — a mid-decade redrawing of district lines to maintain Republican control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year.
That move motivated California Gov. Gavin Newsom to say that he would try to counter Texas and redraw his state’s congressional map (although that could only happen if state voters pause a state law establishing an independent commission). Governors in both blue and red states have since said they would consider redistricting.
DeSantis first took up the issue on July 24, when he said in Bradenton that he thought that the state was “malapportioned.”
“So, I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade?” he said. “So, we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you, just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five year period. It’s been really significant.”
DeSantis maintains that the state’s population was severely undercounted in the 2020 U.S. Census and that along with the changes in population (which in Florida includes many more registered Republicans than there were in 2020), the time is now to redraw congressional seats instead of waiting until 2032.
In response, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez (R-Miami) has created a select committee on congressional redistricting and named Rep. Mike Redondo (R-Miami) to chair it earlier this week. Senate President Ben Albritton (R-Wauchula) has not said whether he will create a similar committee.
Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate David Jolly argues Florida and every other state in the country should create an independent redistricting commission.  According to the Common Cause survey, an overwhelming majority of voters in Florida (76%) do, as well.
On Tuesday, the Missouri House of Representatives passed a new congressional map. That prompted Trump to write on social media that “this new Map will give the wonderful people of Missouri the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections. The Missouri Senate must pass this Map now, AS IS, to deliver a gigantic Victory for Republicans in the ‘Show Me State,’ and across the Country.”
Common Cause commissioned Noble Predictive Insights to conduct the 499-person Florida poll between Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. It has an error margin of +/- 4.39%.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In a Sept. 9 letter obtained by The Mercury, George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson informed Democratic leaders in the Virginia Senate that he will not step down from his post on the school’s governing board despite their request for him to do so.
Democrats asked Stimson to resign after the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, where he serves as a senior legal fellow, published a report titled “Uncovering Radical Efforts to Disguise DEI,” that lawmakers said “targets” and “undermines” the institution and GMU President Gregory Washington. The Sept. 2 report was published as the institution navigates federal investigations focused on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to root out at universities in Virginia and nationwide.
Va. Senate Democrats call on George Mason rector to step down, alleging conflict of interest

Stimson wrote to top Senate Democrats that he appreciates their interest and partnership, but plans to remain on the board and continue to leave his personal views “at the door.” 
“I am completely committed to my continued service as Rector,” Stimson wrote. “The board is fully focused on our fiduciary duties to GMU and the commonwealth, securing the university’s funding and ensuring it continues to make all Virginians proud as a world-class academic institution. We will continue to serve the university and follow the law.”
The retired Naval officer with the Judge Advocate General Corps also said his scholarship on national security and crime policy at the Heritage Foundation has “no connection” to the foundation’s education policy work.
“Since my appointment to the Board of Visitors, I have made certain that I am fully walled off from Heritage’s work concerning education policy, especially GMU,” Stimson wrote. “I strongly reject the premise that any citizen of our commonwealth should be disqualified from public service simply because some elected officials may disagree with statements or articles attributed to other private individuals who happen to work for the same employer.” 
On Aug. 22, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights announced that George Mason University violated federal civil rights laws due to alleged unlawful hiring and promotion practices. Washington’s attorney pushed back against the claims, and the governing board stated that they wished to negotiate a resolution with the agency. Stimson’s letter to lawmakers’ didn’t reference the situation.

The board is down to six voting members after the state Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected multiple appointments by Gov. Glenn Youngkin to GMU’s 16-member governing board. The governor is the only person with the authority to remove an appointment from a governing board, but the legislature has the power to confirm or reject the governor’s board appointees. The matter is now under review by the Virginia Supreme Court.
Stimson joined the board on July 1, 2023 after being confirmed by the General Assembly. He was elected leader of the board a year later, which included members appointed by the previous Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Stimson’s term ends June 30, 2027.

Adam Hollier (D-Detroit) | Ken Coleman photo Former state Sen. Adam Hollier has long eyed a seat in Congress, but on Wednesday, the Michigan Democrat officially ended his bid for a Detroit-based congressional district and pivoted to a run at secretary of state.
Hollier now joins Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and Aghogho Edevbie, Michigan’s deputy secretary of state under Jocelyn Benson, in the battle for the party’s nomination in August.
As a former U.S. Army paratrooper who served as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s director of the Veterans Affairs Agency in 2023, Hollier said he’s ready for the next mission. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Our fundamental rights are under attack like never before. Donald Trump and his MAGA allies have put everything from free and fair elections to the right to vote on the chopping block” Hollier said in a statement. “As a U.S. Army Paratrooper, I’m trained to go where the challenge is greatest. As your Secretary of State, I will lead the fight against any assaults on our fundamental freedoms, and will never back down in the face of these undemocratic and unconstitutional attacks.”
A cornerstone of his new campaign would be a push to stop Republicans from rigging state and federal elections and silencing the voices of Michigan voters. He also pledged to remove barriers at the ballot box, boost turnout and make it easier to vote and cast a ballot early.
Hollier said he would invest in local clerks, giving them the resources they need to conduct fair and efficient elections.
One consideration for Hollier was whether to enter a leaner race with only two declared candidates, as opposed to the crowded potential field in the 13th Congressional District race. U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar currently represents the district, which is primarily seated in Detroit.
Hollier was one of 10 candidates in the Democratic primary for the seat in 2022, which led to Thanedar beating a slate of Black candidates, including Hollier, with just 28% of the vote. The race and Thaendar’s election has been criticized in Michigan because the packed ballot ended up working against Black candidates who may have had a better chance at getting elected with a smaller primary field.
The Democratic primary for the seat in Detroit is viewed as the race to win, as Democrats are typically elected in the general election against whomever the Republicans put up as a candidate.
Hollier, in a news release announcing his bid for secretary of state, specifically cited his wish to ensure that majority Black Detroit elects a Black member of Congress in the next round. Thanedar is again seeking reelection, and minus Hollier, already is facing three candidates in the Democratic primary – including state Rep. Donavan McKinney of Detroit.
Hollier’s announcement Wednesday also came with a long list of day-one supporters, including Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter, state representatives Joe Tate of Detroit and Peter Herzberg of Westland, and more than 30 local officials, former electeds and faith leaders.

(Courtesy of SiouxFalls.Business)In just a few weeks, one of the federal government’s most effective tools for boosting rural economies could disappear.
The Small Business Innovation Research program — a funding pipeline that has supported countless scientific and medical breakthroughs that grow the economy and save lives — will expire on Sept. 30 unless Congress acts.
Here in South Dakota, the program is a lifeline for researchers working on next-generation cancer therapies, for startups developing tools to combat livestock diseases, and for communities hoping to attract high-paying, advanced manufacturing jobs. The program is vital to the state’s patients, researchers, and entrepreneurs.

Since its creation in 1982, the program has awarded more than 170,000 grants nationwide, injecting over $50 billion into America’s economy. The model is simple: Federal agencies set aside a portion of their research budgets to fund small businesses with big ideas. The result is a steady flow of funding for startups that are so small, they’re not yet able to attract venture capital — but that ultimately changes lives, improves health outcomes, and drives economic growth.
South Dakota is a proud beneficiary of that model, and an active partner in sustaining it. Over the past decade, dozens of South Dakota companies — many of them spinouts from university labs or small teams of rural entrepreneurs — have secured awards that helped turn bench science into real-world solutions. To strengthen these efforts, the state offers additional $25,000 grants to select awardees, giving startups a boost as they refine their technologies and begin to commercialize them.
This joint support is already delivering results across the state.
Take a look at SAB Biotherapeutics in Sioux Falls. SAB used a $1.42 million Small Business Innovation Research grant to develop immunotherapies that harness genetically engineered cattle that produce human antibodies to treat influenza. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, SAB was ready to respond, using its antibody platform to help develop countermeasures against the virus. That research wouldn’t have advanced without the initial support.
OmegaQuant, another Sioux Falls biotech, used part of its over $833,000 in awards to develop tests that can predict dementia risk, empowering patients with greater control over their health.
The program has also helped fund breakthroughs in animal and agriculture sciences — industries where South Dakota has a competitive edge.

In Brookings, Prairie Aquatech used part of its $1.5 million in awards to refine its sustainable soy-based protein to replace fishmeal in aquaculture feed. The grant helped lay the foundation for a commercial production facility and a growing team of employees. Their success is not just a win for South Dakota’s economy — it’s a model of how environmentalism and agriculture can grow together.
These inventions power a burgeoning sector. South Dakota’s bioscience sector employs more than 7,000 people across 800 businesses. And employment has grown by nearly 7% since 2019. Programs like Small Business Innovation Research are critical for maintaining this momentum.
Failing to reauthorize the program by the Sept. 30 deadline would stall promising research. It would cut off a vital funding source for dozens of small businesses trying to survive the “valley of death” between discovery and commercialization. And it would undermine our ability to compete in the bioscience, energy, artificial intelligence, and other strategic industries.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1785.JPEG-e1757437197822-1024x737.webp,,,2025-09-10 10:57:46.639162

(Getty Images)The Florida Department of Health announced Wednesday that it is updating its immunization requirements and forms for childcare and school admission, plus opt-out provisions.
The notice appeared in the Florida Administrative Register (FAR) along with the information that “if requested in writing and not deemed unnecessary by the agency head” a rule development workshop will be scheduled and announced in a subsequent FAR. The state publishes the document daily.
The DOH did not provide draft language.
The DeSantis administration made national news last week when Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced he wanted to eliminate all vaccinations mandates from Florida law.
Ladapo argued that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.”  
Florida law contains a number of immunization requirements for the young and the old.

DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

The state already allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems and, in some cases, for philosophical beliefs.
Immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus are required for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and home daycare. Florida law also requires school districts to develop and disseminate parent guides that include information about the importance of student health and available immunizations and vaccinations, including, but not limited to, recommended immunization schedules in accordance with federal recommendations.
College students who reside in on-campus housing must provide documentation of vaccinations against meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B. Again, the law contains exemptions and students who refuse the vaccines are required to sign waivers.
Nursing homes are required to assess residents within five business days post admission of eligibility for pneumococcal vaccinations or revaccinations. If indicated, the resident must be be vaccinated or revaccinated within 60 days after admission, in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, subject to exemptions for medical contraindications and religious or personal beliefs.
Wednesday’s announcement appears to target rules for public and nonpublic schools for preschool, kindergarten through grade 12, and adult education classes.
Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott has distanced himself from the proposal but other top Republicans came out in support of the idea. Republican legislative leaders in the House and Senate have been quiet on their positions.

Andy Beshear, left, joins late night TV host Seth Meyers for an interview. (Screenshot)Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear made his late night TV debut on Late Night with Seth Meyers. 
The roughly ten-minute interview aired early Wednesday morning on the East Coast, with the governor touching on a lot of topics that Kentuckians would be familiar with, such as his winning his two gubernatorial campaigns in a red state and his advice to Democrats about how to connect with rural America. 
Beshear also talked about national politics, particularly his opposition to the GOP spending megabill passed by Congress earlier this summer, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Beshear said Republicans “basically punched rural America in the face,” adding that cuts to healthcare in the legislation threaten rural hospitals. 
“This is going to have detrimental impacts, not just to whole communities, but to families. It’s wrong. It’s mean. We need to flip Congress to undo it because that is the only ultimate answer is to rescind this bill,” Beshear said, and Meyers agreed. 
Meyers began the interview with a nod to a regular segment on The Andy Beshear Podcast, where the governor’s Gen Z kids teach him slang each week. Beshear said it “tends to make Dad look a thousand years old,” but he has learned some new phrases. 
“In episode one, I learned the difference between something being ‘skippity’ and ‘fire,’” Beshear said. “And on episode two, I’ve learned I’m ‘doing all this for the plot.’”
Meyers closed out the interview with more personal anecdotes in Beshear’s story that may be unknown to some — his first political losses growing up. Beshear said he ran for student council at his school a few times and lost each time. He also ran for lieutenant governor in a youth government program and came in third among three candidates. 
“I was running because I thought I was supposed to,” Beshear said. “I hadn’t found my why. And what’s interesting is I was probably running on my last name. First election I ever won was in college. It was many years later, and I just ran as Andy.”
Beshear’s father is former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, a longtime state politician who also held roles such as attorney general and lieutenant governor. 
The late night TV interview comes as the current governor angles himself to build a national profile. He recently announced a deal with SiriusXM radio for his podcast and hosting live events. Over the last year, Beshear has also regularly appeared on national news programs. 
Beshear is also the chair-elect of the Democratic Governors Association, meaning he will hold a key fundraising position for Democratic candidates during midterm elections. 
Beshear is seen by some as a possible candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. However, he’s recently polled behind other national Democrats, such as former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-10-at-8.48.08-AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-09-10 10:57:46.639162

New Mexico State University officials say the school is working to educate students to fill the gaps.
The Legislative Health and Human Services Committee met in Las Cruces this week on the NMSU main campus. Committee members were joined Wednesday by NMSU School of Nursing Director Alexa Doig and College of Health, Education and Social Transformation Dean Rick Marlatt. They provided an update on how the School of Nursing is preparing students to meet the health care needs of New Mexicans, especially people living in rural areas of the state.
According to a 2024 report by advocacy organization Think New Mexico, New Mexico needs about 5,700 registered nurses and clinical nurse specialists and about 230 certified nurse practitioners to meet current national benchmarks. The report also notes that the state has some of the oldest physician workforce in the country and nearly 40% of doctors 60 years and older are expected to retire by 2030.
“We want to make sure that [students] understand what’s waiting for them out in the professional field, and the sooner we can get those hands-on experiences, the better,” Marlatt said during the meeting.
Doig highlighted the school’s postgraduate Advanced Practice Registered Nursing certificates, which offer specialized training for nurse practitioner students in several areas, including psychiatric and mental health. “This is really the primary program that is educating and training mental health practitioners who have independent scope of practice within New Mexico,” she said. The program is offered through “distance education,” Doig said, to allow students from all over the state to participate from their location in rural areas or other.
Students studying family practice are also able to complete a second certification program in psychiatric and mental health. The overall program took a hit in enrollment and graduation during the COVID-19 pandemic, Doig said. And while it is still a smaller program, more than 50 students currently participate and numbers continue to improve. She also said about half of the participating students are from New Mexico. 
“I think post-COVID, people really saw, especially nurses, a real need for mental health care providers and they recognize that they can fill that gap,” Doig said. She also pointed to the school’s efforts to integrate primary health care training with behavioral health so all students are equipped to address their patients’ mix of physical and mental health needs. All nursing students take a course on integrated care for diverse populations, which Doig explained “blends and helps amplify the connection between physical health and mental health, and then how to deliver this more integrative care approach.”
Doig stressed the value of having dual certification, but told lawmakers that certified nurse practitioners in New Mexico face the barrier of health care organizations requiring them to choose only one area of practice, rather than integrated care. She told lawmakers she would like to work with them to change policies so practitioners are better prepared to help patients with their various needs, particularly in rural settings or areas with larger health care worker shortages.
“We are in a provider shortage, and we have been for a long time and for the foreseeable future,” Doig said. “There are many jobs available, especially for a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. There is such a severe shortage, our students are often getting job offers before they graduate…Our employment rate data is usually between 90% and 100%.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NMSU-nursing2-1024x715.png,,,2025-09-11 10:56:47.917773

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Last year, Alaska and Canada set a new, lower goal for the number of king salmon returning up the Yukon River and into Canada’s Yukon Territory. 
Now, fish counters show 2025 returns have again failed to meet that lower target after missing in 2024 as well.
Through Aug. 28, when officials at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game stopped counting, an estimated 23,806 Chinook salmon — informally known as kings — had been counted by workers at the sonar site at Eagle, just west of the Yukon border.
Under international agreements, the United States is supposed to allow a minimum number of fish to travel upriver and into the Yukon to maintain the king salmon run and allow fishing in the territory.
Last year, following years of poor returns, officials in Alaska and Canada agreed to restrict king salmon fishing, including Indigenous subsistence fishing, of king salmon on the river until escapement — the number of king salmon crossing into Canada — exceeds 42,500 fish.
The ultimate goal of the agreement is to rebuild the number of king salmon returning until 71,000 kings reach Canada each summer. 
This year’s figures are slightly lower than they were last year, when 24,183 kings reached Canada, but are nearly double the low of 2022, when only an estimated 12,025 kings returned.
King salmon returns on the Yukon River have steadily declined since 2017, when 73,313 fish passed the sonar at Eagle. 
Attention now falls on the Yukon River’s much larger chum salmon run, which is also expected to fail international treaty obligations. As of Sept. 7, ADF&G estimates 276,000 fall chums in the Yukon River, less than a third of the historical run size.
“A run size below 300,000 fall chum salmon is not anticipated to be large enough to meet U.S. tributary goals or Canadian treaty objectives for fall chum salmon,” the department said in an estimate published Tuesday.
As a result of the shortfall, subsistence fishing for chum salmon, a vital part of Alaska Native traditional culture, continues to be suspended. 
Changes in deep-ocean conditions caused by climate change, warming river conditions caused by climate change, commercial fishing, and endemic disease have all been cited as possible reasons for the declining salmon runs.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230623_141443-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-10 12:57:15.402796

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — Federal funding losses upended a courier service used to transport health and water samples to state laboratories, and a Kansas agency is working to determine a way to make sure tests arrive quickly, a state official said. 
Ashley Goss, deputy secretary of public health at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, testified before the Legislative Budget Committee on Aug. 26 that COVID-19 relief funds were used to create the courier service routes in 2021. 
The service transported COVID-19 tests and samples to state laboratories and also has been used by local health departments and public water supply systems to deliver tests and water samples. 
Of 154,196 samples delivered to state laboratories last year, 81,510 were delivered by courier service, Goss said. 
However, when the federal government pulled funding, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment explored alternatives for test and sample delivery, which must occur in a certain timeframe, sometimes within 30 hours, she said.
“In the two years prior to the courier service, the average transit time from collection of a sample to delivery at the lab was 3 days, and since the courier service was brought on in June 2021, the average time has been reduced to 1.8 days,” Goss said.
The difference in transit time is meaningful, she said. 
“Clients and patients receive results quicker, and it has a significant impact on direct patient care and earlier notification to public water supplies of hazardous incidences,” Goss said.
KDHE eliminated courier routes on July 1 to extend the federal dollars into 2026, dropping from 432 environmental and 132 health clients to 192 environmental and 68 health clients, she said. 
Brad Pendergast, city administrator in Scott City, said 2024 was challenging as the western Kansas town figured out a system to send in four monthly water samples. It wasn’t a budget issue, but slow transport of the samples was “a really big headache,” he said.
“It was a source of frustration and a lot of 2024 was like that,” Pendergast said. “At a minimum, we had 10 samples come back and we had to ship them again.”
At some points, they were driving samples 35 miles to Garden City to ship them by FedEx, but eventually the town made arrangements for a FedEx pickup at a local hardware store, he said. 
Health departments and public water departments will have to absorb the cost of shipping samples, Goss said.  
Goss told the budget committee local KDHE partners advocated for additional state dollars to replace the lost federal funding but were unsuccessful. 
“Many local communities still face the challenges of now being short of funding and having to backfill their local budgets to cover paying for their own transit of samples,” she said. 
KDHE is trying to get a bid from the U.S. Postal Service to determine if it could fill the gap created by the end of the courier service, Goss said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ashley-Goss-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-10 09:56:42.120929

Water infrastructure projects in Nevada are heavily reliant on federal funding to ensure safe drinking water. (Photo: Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources)Nevada would lose millions of dollars in funding for water infrastructure and clean air programs under President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by more than half.
Trump and his administration plan to cut the EPA’s budget next year by $4.9 billion, a nearly 55% decrease that would reduce the agency’s budget to levels not seen since the Reagan administration. About half that amount would be stripped from state revolving loan programs that fund drinking water and wastewater projects.
In Nevada the proposed cuts could result in the loss of more than $16 million for state revolving loan programs, according to a report from EDF Action, the advocacy arm of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
Nevada’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which provides low-interest loans and financial assistance to public water projects, would be all but erased, seeing funding reductions of more than 86%, according to the EDF Action analysis. 
The state’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which funds upgrades to wastewater infrastructure, would similarly be devastated by cuts of more than 90% under the Trump administration proposal. 
Last year, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection allocated more than $55 million in state drinking water and clean water revolving funds to 19 communities for infrastructure projects. 
Nevada also saw a surge in demand last year and was set to finalize another $266 million in state drinking water and clean water revolving loan agreements in 2025, according to the agency.
Large water infrastructure projects in Nevada are heavily reliant on federal funding to ensure safe drinking water. The Truckee Meadows Water Authority in Washoe County, for example, was awarded $125 million in state drinking water and clean water revolving funds to build a water purifying facility that would increase water quality and provide a clean water source even in years of severe drought. 
The Trump administration said cuts to the state revolving loan programs were made to return the responsibility of water infrastructure funding to states.
But projects like Reno’s water purifying facility would not have been possible without significant federal funding, said former Administrator for EPA’s Region 9, Martha Guzman Aceves, who helped launch the project.
“These infrastructure projects are so incredibly expensive that states – especially states that have a smaller population, like Nevada – don’t have the economies of scale to do these projects without the federal government,” Guzman Aceves said. 
Without federal funding water utilities would likely be forced to raise rates to cover vital water infrastructure, said Guzman Aceves.
“Responsible governments in Nevada, the municipalities and the water districts, they’re going to make sure that the citizens of Nevada have safe water, but it’s going to come at a much bigger cost. These costs are going to have to be recovered from the rate base” charged to homes and businesses, she continued.
Smaller water utilities that serve rural communities are especially reliant on state revolving loan programs to finance water projects because they can’t afford costly treatment systems or upgrades without significantly raising rates to unaffordable levels.
Silver Springs Mutual Water Company, which serves about 3,000 Nevadans, received more than $4 million from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for six projects between 2022-2024 to replace wells, upgrade tanks, and install new water mains, among other improvements to its drinking water system.
Both state revolving funds provide the bulk of funding for upgrades to drinking water infrastructure projects in the state, including lead service line replacement and treatment for PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” in drinking water.
According to EPA data, more than 485,000 Nevadans are served by a water utility releasing an elevated level of PFAS into drinking water. Nevada also has an estimated 6,783 lead service lines that need to be replaced, according to a 2023 EPA survey.
Trump’s plan to cut the EPA’s budget by more than half would also eliminate the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Program, which provides the state funding to replace older vehicles with newer cleaner engines that reduce air pollution in the state. 
The DERA program helped reduce air pollution that can exacerbate asthma for the more than 269,000 Nevadans who suffer from the condition. In 2023, Nevada was awarded $747,000 to replace four older diesel-powered trucks with cleaner electric trucks.
The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection has also received more than $1.2 million since 2023 from the grant program for an ongoing project to replace diesel-powered buses with clean alternative-fueled versions across multiple school districts.
The EPA cuts would also eliminate the State and Local Air Quality Management Grant, which awarded Nevada more than $4 million in 2023 to monitor air quality standards.
Guzman Aceves called the cuts “unprecedented” and potentially “catastrophic” for state and local municipalities that need infrastructure improvements to tackle growing drought and air pollution. 
“These things are not done on an individual level. You can’t clean the air individually. You can’t go home and have safe water and clean clean air without the government playing a role. It doesn’t work that way.

(Photo provided by Andrew Bailey's 2024 campaign).One of former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s headline-grabbing actions — a rule that would have required social media companies to provide third-party content moderators — was quietly dropped just before he resigned.
Bailey became co-deputy director of the FBI on Monday and was replaced as attorney general by Catherine Hanaway. The rule for social media companies was announced in May and hailed by Bailey as a protection for individual free speech on popular platforms.
“This rule marks the beginning of a sustained effort to dismantle the ‘Big Brother’ speech-control machinery of corporate America,” Bailey said in a May 6 news release.
The proposed rules were published in the Missouri Register on June 16. Comments closed on July 16, opening a 59-day window for the next step, filing the proposal with the legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules. 
The rule was filed with the committee but withdrawn on Friday. Bailey’s office did not put out a news release about the decision to withdraw the rule.
The proposal sought to use the attorney general’s authority under Missouri’s consumer protection laws to impose the requirements. Any user would be allowed to select a content moderator of their choosing — either the system provided by the social media platform or a third party — when they created an account and every six months it is active.
Free speech advocates and lobbying groups for the communications industry filed comments arguing Bailey had overstepped his authority, was imposing unworkable requirements and violated the free speech rights of the social media providers.
“This rule is economically inefficient, technically unworkable and legally vulnerable, representing a regulatory solution that is demonstrably worse than the problems it purports to address,” the International Center for Law & Economics, a Portland, Oregon,-based think tank, said in its comments.
The rule, the Computer & Communications Industry Association said in its comments, would force platforms to allow outside entities to manage content without oversight or privacy protections. 
“This approach would make it harder to remove scams, harassment, and other illegal or dangerous content, while violating websites’ First Amendment right to decide what speech they host,” said the association, which is the lobbying arm of the computer industry.
And NetChoice, a trade association of online businesses that successfully sued to block laws in Florida and Texas that had similar objective, said in its comments that Bailey had misunderstood the U.S. Supreme Court decision in its favor.
In that ruling, the court said the Florida and Texas laws violate the First Amendment rights social media companies enjoy as publishers of content. 
NetChoice wrote in its comments that “rather than respecting regulated websites’ First Amendment rights recognized in (the court decision), the rule would trample over those protections.”
In the withdrawal notice, the attorney general’s office said it agreed with the concerns from commenters about the feasibility of implementing the rule as drafted and that more work would be required.
“The attorney general’s decision to withdraw this rulemaking,” the notice stated, “is not due to comments suggesting he lacks legal authority to issue the rule.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/53541952138_d0d140bb45_o-e1721223103169.jpg,,,2025-09-10 09:56:42.120929

In the town that saw California’s deadliest wildfire seven years ago, a state-of-the-art elementary school is rising. It’ll have a STEM lab, soccer field and outdoor stage — manifestations of Paradise’s hopes for its future.
But while breaking ground and constructing a new 46,000-square-foot campus is one achievement, the road to recovery for the students of Paradise remains long, complex and difficult. It’s a hardship that is likely to become more common throughout the state as the threat of wildfires intensifies, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
The 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people, destroyed more than 18,000 buildings — including most of the town’s dozen schools — and displaced at least 26,000 people. In its aftermath, Paradise Unified reported 154 school closure days, which affected about 4,200 students, according to a CalMatters analysis.
Compounded by learning loss from the pandemic, only 13% of graduating seniors in Paradise Unified met the entrance requirements for California’s public universities last year or completed a career training program, compared with 45% statewide. Only 11% of eighth graders also met the state’s standard for math, and 18% of sixth graders were reading at grade level. District enrollment remains less than half what it was before the fire.
But in the wake of a catastrophe, stressing academic performance or attendance while prioritizing students’ mental health is a delicate balance: For most kids, anxiety and grief stemming from the Camp Fire has made focusing on schoolwork a monumental task. Teachers who lost their homes and now commute long distances have also struggled during the fallout of the wildfire.
Myah Poe, a recent graduate of HomeTech charter school in Paradise, lost her home to the fire. After living in motels and rentals with her family, she was able to return to Paradise two years ago.

Poe: “People see disasters on the news and they think, ‘Oh, that happened, it’ll be over after a year.’ It’s not. It stays with you for a long, long time.”

She bore her heart for mental health legislation

In the past few months, Christine Matlock Dougherty traveled more than 400 miles from her Yucaipa home in San Bernardino County to Sacramento on three separate occasions to advocate for two bills that would have regulated mental health insurance. 
The measures failed to advance this year, but Dougherty pledges to press on in honor of her son, writes CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener.
Ryan Matlock died of a fentanyl overdose in 2021 after his insurance plan declined to continue covering his stay at an addiction treatment center. After speaking with CalMatters last year about her 23-year-old son’s passing, lawmakers asked her to testify on behalf of two bills to help prevent similar tragedies.
But in a tough budget year for the state, both bills were held in committees that oversee new spending. In the face of those legislative losses, however, Dougherty vows to continue her fight: “I will do it again. For Ryan.”

Intrigue over last-minute legislative deals

Though it’s not unusual for top leaders in California’s government to iron out legislative deals behind closed doors during the last days of session, this week is particularly notable because the fate of so many consequential bills is still up in the air, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
Before lawmakers adjourn Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democratic legislative leaders and their staff are working to make deals on whether to join a regional electricity market with other Western states; bolster the state’s wildfire funds; and increase California’s oil production. A $750 million loan for Bay Area public transit systems is also in limbo, with no clear resolution to date.
This lack of transparency is frustrating some lobbyists and advocates, who find themselves relying on draft bill language leaked to news outlets for information. 
But withholding details about deals could help measures advance, since it allows lobbyists less time to object, said former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat. 

Rendon: “Is that the best thing to do? Is that the most democratic thing to do? No. That’s the way our system works.”

David Michael Winter (1960 – 2025) Essex Jct.
Dave was born on March 19, 1960, in Barre City Hospital and died September 5, 2025, in the McClure Miller Respite House in Colchester, Vermont, after a long battle with cancer.
Dave was a lifelong hiker, climbing his first mountain, Camel’s Hump, at the age of 5; completing the Long Trail at 13 to become its youngest solo End-to-Ender; and continuing to climb Camel’s Hump and nearby mountains until the last year of his life. His appreciation of the wilderness made him a strong proponent of restoring and enhancing our environmental protections.
Overcoming many personal obstacles, he was a fierce advocate for the poor, homeless, mentally ill, and others he believed were ill-treated by society. He worked for many years at COTS, as well as helping people cope with jail release, substance abuse, and other problems.
For several years, Dave was a self-employed logger and snowplow contractor. In his last years, he was a bus driver for GMTA, a job he thoroughly enjoyed, and a proud member of the Teamsters Union, until their leadership supported Trump.
Dave was an avid writer and published several chapbooks of original poetry. He continued to pen new work until the last week of his life.
His many other interests included martial arts, both Tai Chi and Kempo Ju Jitsu, where he proudly achieved a purple belt. While opposed to most forms of consumerism, Dave was a lifelong coin collector; he also collected movies, tools, and Magic Cards.
Dave was a lover of all creatures on four legs, especially dogs. His childhood dog Schatzie was his constant hiking companion. As an adult, he was never in a position to keep a dog, but his family’s dogs (“puppies”) always gave him, and them, joy.
While Dave took his civic responsibilities seriously, working hard to support candidates who shared his views and letting his representatives know where he stood on issues, he may be remembered best for his generosity of spirit and willingness to lend a helping hand to friends, neighbors, and family. He showed a special level of care to his mom, claiming he “tortured that poor woman” as a teenager.
We wish to express our sincere thanks to all the staff and volunteers at McLure-Miller who took such good care of him in his final days. And we especially want to thank all his friends who visited him at both the hospitals and respite house – it did a lot to brighten his spirits. And your friendship is the best testament to the man Dave was.
Dave was predeceased by his mentor and his mother’s long-time partner, Alvin Gover. He is survived by his mother, Hazel Winter; sister, Monique “Moki” Fox; father, James Winter and his wife, Kelly Winter, who hand-knit Dave many beautiful hats; nephew Jesse Fox and wife, Eron, and their children, Irie, Morgan, Lyran, Quinten, Stella, Jacob and Adelaide; niece Lizzy Fox Lausier, her husband, Steve, and their daughter, Sylvia; and niece, Nurto Hassan.

Montpelier, Vermont
Died Aug. 15, 2025
Tampa, Florida


Timothy Joseph Perry died on August 15, 2025 at his home in Tampa, Florida. He was born on August 30, 1951 in Montpelier, VT. Tim is survived by his siblings Betty Tassie, Michael Perry, Ruby Perry, Dave Perry, Mary Patricia Perry and many nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his parents Nelson and Kathryn Perry, his stepmother Gene Perry and his sister Dorothy Stewart O’Mara.
Tim grew up in Montpelier, the fourth of the seven Perry children. He made his way through St. Michael’s School, where the nuns tried – unsuccessfully – to tame his curly red hair and his freedom-loving spirit. He always loved animals, and opened his Florida home to an ever-changing array of feral cats, but he had two all-time favorite pets. One was Oscar the cat who was with him when he died and Black Dog who predeceased him.
Throughout Tim’s life, his best friend, fishing partner and drinking buddy was his brother Mike. He spent much of the Vermont portion of his adult life in his beloved Champlain Islands. Before moving south for warmer climes, he made his home in Grand Isle where his mother and maternal ancestors are buried. His ashes will be returned to the Islands and to Lake Champlain as he requested. We will remember him in his favorite job as a ferry captain for Lake Champlain ferries.
Tim was a self-taught thinker, a voracious reader, and a fixer of all things mechanical. In his Florida years, he smoked cigars and built electric bikes from parts ordered online. For years after his dad’s death in 1995, Tim helped his stepmother Gene with routine home repairs. He followed the news and had strong opinions about…well, everything. He lived every day of his life exactly as he chose.
His siblings started doing weekly Zoom calls at the beginning of the pandemic. Tim never skipped one until the day he died. We will all miss his gruff but attentive presence.
There is no memorial service planned, though the family will gather in the fall somewhere on the shores of Lake Champlain to spread his ashes.

But the biggest barrier was the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program.","In summary
After weeks of tense and messy negotiations, California’s legislative leaders finally released several proposals that range from expanding domestic crude oil production to lowering electricity rates. But the biggest barrier was the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program.


California legislative leaders in the wee hours of Wednesday morning reached an agreement with Gov. Gavin Newsom to extend the state’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction program, known as cap and trade, through 2045 — a contentious expansion that for weeks stewed in backroom discussions, held up other critical legislation and roiled insiders. 
Democratic leaders in the Assembly and Senate also struck compromises on bills to increase domestic oil production in California through new drilling permits and rehabilitating a defunct offshore pipeline; establish a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities; re-up the state’s wildfire liability fund by $18 billion; and join neighboring states’ utilities to create a shared electricity market to sell California’s excess clean power.
The mountain of deals comes after a chaotic scramble of last-minute closed-door negotiations among Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, which frustrated lobbyists and angered rank-and-file members, some of whom said they felt iced out of the conversations.
Because the agreements landed so late in the final week of the legislative session, lawmakers will have to waive rules so they can extend what was supposed to be their last day of session, Friday, to vote Saturday on the climate and energy package. California voters approved a constitutional amendment that requires legislation to be public for at least 72 hours before a vote.
Newsom even made an after-hours visit to the Capitol Tuesday night, where he, Rivas and McGuire huddled in a Senate office for close to 90 minutes. 
Despite the tense, high-stakes haggling, the three leaders on Wednesday triumphantly celebrated what they declared a historic agreement that they said gives Californians the best of both worlds — stable gas and electricity prices as well as progress toward the state’s ambitious climate goals. 
“We took the time to get it right because real change, reduced prices and protecting homeowners is essential,” Rivas said in the joint statement.
The governor’s desire to keep lower gas prices — a crucial headline as he courts a national audience ahead of 2028 — also dovetailed neatly with Rivas’s early commitment to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.” Critics often parroted that lofty goal to challenge legislation that they argued would raise costs for consumers. 
But while Newsom and Rivas were largely aligned on tempering the state’s ambitious climate goals amid the reality of rising costs, McGuire and his staff were wary of handing wins to polluting industries without extracting victories for environmental and social justice causes. 
Bickering over cap and trade
At the heart of the negotiations was disagreement over how to renew cap and trade, which the governor’s office has rebranded as “cap and invest.” The program is a key source of revenue for the state’s environmental, climate and other priorities in the midst of a challenging budget year marked by a $12 billion budget deficit. The Trump administration has also sought to block funding for key priorities such as clean energy, high-speed rail and electric cars.
The extension seeks to align the program with the state’s aggressive push to wean itself from fossil fuels by 2045.

Cap-and-trade is a policy that puts a price on carbon emissions. The government sets a hard limit on emissions and issues a fixed number of pollution permits. Companies must hold permits for every ton they emit — but if they pollute less, they can sell their spare permits for profit, turning cutting carbon into a market incentive.
Although the program wasn’t set to expire until 2030, proponents of reauthorization argued that buyers of these credits — industry polluters — needed certainty that the program would continue to exist to keep bringing in revenues needed to fund the state’s transition to clean energy. A group pushing for an extension, Clean and Prosperous California, estimated that uncertainty over the program had resulted in a loss of nearly $3 billion in auction revenues over a year.
Earlier this summer, Newsom proposed reupping the program without any substantive changes, much to the chagrin of environmental advocates. That was an early sign of his warming relationships with the state’s oil and gas industry as companies announced they would cease operations in California, and more threatened to yank operations due to high costs of doing business.
Ultimately, each chamber will carry a separate piece of the deal.
Assembly Bill 1207 reauthorizes the program and makes slight changes to how the California Air Resources Board distributes free “allowances” — or pollution permits — to various types of polluters. 
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 840 provides a blueprint for how the state should spend revenues from the program, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget, while continuing to support housing, transit, clean-air programs, wildfire prevention and safe drinking water. 
The bill also requires the air resources board to revisit its rules on “offsets” – which let companies cover their emissions by paying for pollution cuts somewhere else — with a study due in 2026.
Individual consumers will continue to reap a benefit from the program. The deal keeps a twice-yearly climate credit, tweaking it so that a break on utility bills shows up during months when bills are the highest.
Other climate bills delayed before deal
Caught up in the negotiations were several other proposals that now can also move forward. 
One is a multi-pronged plan to aid oil refineries by boosting the state’s domestic crude oil production. A key part of the measure waives the state’s landmark environmental review law for new oil wells in Kern County and clears the way for drilling projects to receive permits that were tied up in nearly a decade of litigation. The plan also makes it more difficult to rehabilitate defunct oil pipelines and requires extra layers of environmental assessment. 
Also part of the deal were various Democrats’ strategies for reigning in Californians’ utilities bills, including a Newsom-backed measure to create a Western regional energy market. 
Proponents, including mainstream environmental groups and the powerful statewide electrical workers’ union, say such a market is important for the state to meet its carbon-free goals and lower electricity rates for consumers. 
The package also contains measures for Democrats who want to further regulate utilities to lower costs. 
Senate Bill 254 would set up a public financing system to fund the construction of new transmission lines, which are largely owned by the major utilities. Transmission costs are a significant factor in utility bills. Consumer advocates believe some public ownership of new transmission lines would reduce costs because developers could take advantage of low-interest bonds to pay for them. Funding would need to be approved through the budget process.
Utilities would also be barred from profiting on the first $6 billion in costs the three major investor-owned power companies incur after this year from making their infrastructure more fire-safe. This builds on a similar 2019 law excluding the first $5 billion from profit-making.

“They were kicking and screaming on that,” Sen. Josh Becker, a Menlo Park Democrat and author of several of the energy proposals, said of the utilities.
SB 254 also includes a Newsom priority to add $18 billion to the state’s wildfire fund, which was created in 2019 to pay wildfire victims in disasters caused by utilities to avoid bankrupting utilities. The utility companies had pushed hard to replenish the fund as it was running dry from claims after the January Eaton Fire in Altadena, which sparked near Southern California Edison equipment. 
Contributions to the fund would be split equally among the shareholders and ratepayers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.
Do Democrats have the votes for cap and trade?
Despite the last-minute scramble, it’s unclear whether Newsom and Democrats have the necessary support to clear the two-thirds majority required in both chambers for tax-related measures like cap and trade. Lobbyists and advocates were reading the new language Wednesday and evaluating whether to support the measures. 
The last time the program was reauthorized, then-Gov. Jerry Brown swayed some Republicans and won the support of both the oil and gas industry and CalChamber.
While Republicans have not outright denounced the proposals, Democrats shouldn’t necessarily count on their allyship. Sen. Shannon Grove, a Republican from Bakersfield who for years has warned against overregulating the oil and gas industry, said she was scrambling to assess the details of a plan that was completely secret until just a few hours ago. 
“It’s a multibillion-dollar piece of legislation, and I don’t know what’s in it, so I can’t tell you,” Grove said when asked if she would support the bills.
The business community, including the California Chamber of Commerce and the powerful Western States Petroleum Association, strongly opposed the changes even before the final wording was released, staging an all-out lobbying effort this week as lawmakers returned to the Capitol. 
“WSPA strongly opposes this rushed attempt to reauthorize the state’s Cap-and-Trade program behind closed doors in the remaining days of the legislative session,” the association said in a statement Monday night. Neither the Chamber or WSPA commented on the public cap and trade proposals Wednesday.

Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates — who advocate for low-income and disadvantaged communities that often live closer to polluting industries — and other environmental advocates said the proposal doesn’t go far enough. The coalition was primarily disappointed that the bill to mandate a pollution monitoring program for disadvantaged communities did not include the specific areas and neighborhoods that they outlined in previous legislation. 
The group wrote in a joint statement Wednesday that key parts of their proposals had been rejected and said the legislation continues to make “communities into sacrifice zones for the benefit of industry profit.”
“There’s a lot of money left on the table,” said Ryan Schleeter, a spokesman for the Climate Center. “There could have been more done to shore up that revenue for future years, and there’s a lot of money that’s still flowing to oil and gas corporations through the cap-and-trade program.”

One of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history, the Camp Fire is among the many natural disasters that have upended student learning over the past decade.


CalMatters is collaborating with The Associated Press, Honolulu Civil Beat, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.
Nearly seven years after Paradise was ravaged by wildfire, the foothill town smells like pine trees again. New homes are sprouting up on once-scorched lots. Construction trucks rumble through neighborhoods. An ice cream shop recently opened around the corner from the newly rebuilt high school. 
But in the town’s classrooms, recovery has been more complicated — and much slower. Even as Paradise gradually rebuilds schools lost to California’s 2018 Camp Fire, officials have found getting kids on track academically — and recreating a tight-knit, thriving school community — is a lot tougher than just flipping on the lights at a new campus.
“We’ll get there, but we have not yet recovered,” said Superintendent Tom Taylor before he retired in May. “We’re not yet where we want to be.”
One of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history, the Camp Fire is among the many natural disasters that have upended student learning over the past decade. Damaged schools, lost homes and layers of trauma have left a mark on thousands of children — a scenario sure to continue as climate change makes these events more frequent and more intense. 
The challenges that persist in Paradise are a reminder of how long learning recovery can take — and a lesson on how schools can give traumatized kids a better chance of thriving long term. 
It’s also a lesson on how to balance mental health and academics in the years following a disaster — and a glimpse into the challenges facing schools in Los Angeles after last year’s fires. For most students, the Camp Fire and its aftermath made it almost impossible to focus on schoolwork. Schools pushed academics aside in favor of mental health, a move that most agreed was necessary but set students back months if not years academically.

“People think, natural disaster — mental health. They don’t think about the academic component to it,” said Carrie Dawes, health and wellness coordinator for Paradise Unified. “You put that aside when you have a little kiddo crying because they don’t have a house to live in. You’re not going to say, ‘OK, snap out of it. We’ve got math to do.’”
Camp Fire left students in a lingering academic malaise
In the Paradise disaster’s wake, students found themselves moving frequently. Schools were temporarily housed in unusual places — hardware stores, warehouses, churches. Nearly everyone was consumed by anxiety and grief. Learning fell to the wayside.
Kenny Michael, a high school senior, was in fifth grade when the fire erupted. Although her immediate family was safe, some beloved neighbors died. Michael spent months grappling with family strife, loss and stress, including over her grandmother’s missing cats.
“It wasn’t just a matter of the fire hitting,” Michael said. “It was all this other stuff, too.” 
Once an enthusiastic learner, Michael failed fifth grade and lost interest in school, saying she was too distracted and exhausted to concentrate on classroom lessons. She’s now living with her grandmother in Magalia, a small community adjacent to Paradise, and attends an online school. She takes solace in talking to friends and writing horror and fantasy stories — about fire. 
But she has no immediate plans to attend college after she graduates this year.

This is typical for Paradise teens. Last year, only 13% of graduating seniors in Paradise Unified met the entrance requirements for California’s public universities or completed a career training program, compared with 45% statewide. Last year, not one student from Paradise Unified enrolled as a freshman at the University of California.
Test scores reflect the academic malaise, prolonged by the pandemic. Among eighth graders, only 11% met the state’s standard for math. Just 18% of sixth graders were reading at grade level. The numbers were even worse for low-income students.
The statistics show that, even once the immediate effects of the fire subsided, academics continued their downward spiral. 
Disaster-related absences take a steep toll on learning
Before the Camp Fire roared through Butte County in November 2018, Paradise was a quiet, woodsy town filled with families and retirees. There was a movie theater, a bowling alley, a pet store and a Foster’s Freeze. Everyone loved the beer brittle at Joy Lyn’s candy shop. In April, residents celebrated Gold Nugget Days with a parade, chili cook-off and a Miss Gold Nugget contest.  
Within a few hours, all of that was gone. The Gold Rush-era town was almost entirely wiped out in the fire. Eighty-five people died, including some in their cars as they tried to escape. More than 18,000 buildings burned, including most of the town’s dozen schools. At least 26,000 people were displaced.
Schools began the long process of recovery as the chaos began to settle: locating students, finding new facilities, assessing the damage and getting academics back on track after nearly a month of canceled classes. 
It’s been a protracted process.

During the 2018-19 school year, the Paradise Unified School District reported 154 closure days across its dozen schools as a result of the Camp Fire, impacting about 4,200 students, according to data analysis by CalMatters. But the impacts of the Camp Fire were far reaching, impacting nearly 1 million students across the state — 15% of all students that year — as drifting smoke prompted more than 1,600 schools to close.
In the following five years, Paradise schools reported up to 10 closure days a year, mostly from winter storms and shutting off the power to lower fire risks on dry and windy days.
Since 2022-23, kids in California have lost more than 3.5 million days of learning because of disasters, according to UndauntedK12, a policy and research group. And that learning loss is magnified because of the stress associated with such catastrophes. 
It’s not uncommon for students to miss school after a natural disaster, either because they’ve suddenly become homeless or due to mental health struggles, or both. But disaster-related absenteeism can take an especially steep toll on students’ learning, according to research from the NWEA, a not-for-profit education research firm. Middle schoolers who lose a week of school due to extreme weather actually miss three weeks of progress in reading and almost four weeks in math, researchers found, most likely due to trouble concentrating.
It’s a concern facing a growing number of schools nationwide.

In North Carolina, some students lost two months’ worth of class this past academic year because of both Hurricane Helene last September and other extreme weather events. The historic Category 4 storm damaged tens of thousands of homes and numerous school buildings, causing mass displacement and academic setbacks. 
In Hawaii, the deadly August 2023 Lahaina wildfires resulted in students at four schools losing at least five weeks of learning days. At King Kamehameha III Elementary, a historic elementary school that burned down in the fires, kids lost more than 50 days of instruction. 
The compound effects of missed class time are evident in Lahaina. Students’ test scores took a sharp dip in the school year after the disaster as kids transitioned between online classes, learning hubs and schools outside of West Maui. Only 29% of King Kamehameha III’s students tested proficient in math in spring 2024, for example, compared with 46% the year before. 
Even at the three Lahaina public schools that remained standing after the fires, students weren’t able to return to the campuses until mid-October because of debris cleanup and environmental testing.  
Students struggled to find motivation in school or attended class sporadically before the fires, according to Lahainaluna High School teacher Jarrett Chapin, and the disaster made matters worse. In the 2023-24 school year, 28% of Lahainaluna students were proficient in English, compared with nearly 50% the year before the fire. Only 5% of kids tested proficient in math. 
Finding normalcy can be a struggle after a disaster
In Paradise, even as the town’s schools set about rebuilding damaged campuses and tending to students and families, the community faced another reality: It would never be the same.
Casey Taylor, Achieve Charter School superintendent, described the first few months after the fire as the “hero phase,” where the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. “Paradise Strong” and “We Will Rebuild” signs proliferated. 
But then a more difficult period ensued, rife with disillusionment. Fire survivors got tired of living out of suitcases, and many were daunted by the hassle and expense of rebuilding. Old friends and neighbors started moving away, bringing further layers of loss, Taylor said. 
“It hurts,” said Taylor, a Paradise native whose own home was destroyed in the fire. “Your community just starts spiraling.”

Enrollment in Paradise Unified has been increasing, but is still less than half what it was before the fire — 1,657 last year, compared with 3,441 in 2017. And the student body is a bit different from before the fire: lower-income, more diverse, more students with disabilities. At least a quarter of the students are new to Paradise entirely and didn’t experience the fire.
In retrospect, it’s clear teachers — and not just kids — needed more support to deal with these changes. Taylor and other Paradise school officials now advise other districts that have experienced a natural disaster, and their top suggestion is to make sure the adults are cared for, too.
“We found that initially, the adults needed attention the most. You think it’s going to be the kids, but they’re so much more resilient in the moment,” said Michelle Zevely, Butte County Office of Education’s deputy superintendent of student programs and education support. 
In Paradise, the community relied on teachers to serve as a backbone amid the chaos. But many teachers also lost their homes, which meant they were haggling with insurance companies while finding new places to live and commuting long distances — in some cases, more than 100 miles — to be with their students every day.
“Teachers just needed to talk, or to cry, but they couldn’t because they’re in the classroom and the students were their top priority,” said Tamara Conry, a former math teacher at Paradise Intermediate School who now works for the state teachers union.
When academics fall by the wayside
Another lesson from Paradise is the importance of prioritizing academics even when the impulse is to drop everything in favor of mental health. The first few years after the fire, school days were dedicated almost entirely to social-emotional activities as therapists and counselors were dispatched to campuses. 
“In the beginning, we did a lot of art and singing. Taking daily walks. We had baby goats and therapy dogs,” said Taylor. “We spent a lot of time talking about emotions, because that’s what we needed.”
The mental-health focus was indeed necessary. Aryah Berkowitz, who was in sixth grade at Achieve charter school when the fire took her home, two of her dogs and her family’s business, said the therapy and teachers’ social-emotional offerings were instrumental in helping her through those difficult years after the fire.
But those activities shouldn’t come at the expense of algebra and reading, Taylor said. 
Once an ambitious student, Berkowitz was suspended twice for acting out after the 2018 disaster. It took her four years, she said, to focus on academics again. But she credits her teachers and counselors in Paradise for helping her through that difficult time, and getting her back on track: She graduated from high school in June and plans to join the Army, pursuing her goal of becoming a K-9 handler.  
Striking a balance between mental health and academics is essential for recovery efforts to be sustainable, Paradise educators and students say, given how long those efforts take, “People see disasters on the news and they think, ‘Oh, that happened, it’ll be over after a year,” said Myah Poe, a recent graduate of HomeTech charter school in Paradise. She lost her home in the fire and bounced around motels and rentals with her family before they were finally able to rebuild and return to Paradise two years ago. “It’s not. It stays with you for a long, long time.”
Poe is now planning to enroll in community college and transfer to a four-year university. Her intended major: engineering, inspired in part by the builders resurrecting her hometown.

Taylor remembers the first signs of renewal in Paradise, when the town became something more than an ashy moonscape. First a gas station opened, then a grocery was rebuilt, and eventually the Gold Nugget celebration returned. Even Joy Lyn’s candy shop reopened. 
For Taylor, the pivotal moment came when her school was able to move back to its original campus after operating out of a church in Chico for three years. Families sobbed when they saw the new playground and the freshly painted school buildings.
The next milestone, she and others said, must be academic. Teachers need to set higher expectations, and schools need to provide tutoring and other support to help students catch up. Emotional wellness and academic rigor should not be mutually exclusive, Taylor said. 
It’s a lesson recovering schools are applying in other disaster-torn parts of the country. 
Just two years after Maui’s devastating fires, for example, Lahainaluna High has doubled down on college preparation for students, introducing an Advanced Placement seminar class last fall that challenged students with intense research projects and writing assignments. The school has also increased enforcement of students’ attendance, contacting parents when their kids don’t show up to class. 
While the rigor and heightened accountability have been daunting for some students, many rose to the challenge and are proud of what they’ve achieved in school, according to Chapin, the local high school teacher. “I think our successes this year have crowded out a lot of stuff that could have paralyzed us,” he said. 
Paradise Unified broke ground in June on rebuilding its main elementary school. The 46,000-square-foot campus will include a STEM lab, soccer field and outdoor stage. 
“It took almost five years before we could see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Taylor said. “But now the light is shining very bright.”

Stan Oklobdzija
Stan Oklobdzija is an assistant professor at UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy, where he researches housing policy.


Across the world, cities have struggled to figure out how to provide more affordable housing to people in need.
In Copenhagen, Denmark, so-called social housing accounts for 20% of the region’s housing stock. In Auckland, New Zealand, a set of reforms initiated by the national government in 2021 created a building boom that dropped rents by 28%. 
Coastal California cities, by contrast, have run a two-pronged strategy for low-income housing over the last several decades — the freeway system and inland counties hours away.
With the California Legislature set to consider Senate Bill 79, a bill that automatically permits dense multifamily housing near high-frequency transit stops, many in the state’s most exclusionary cities have found their eyes filled with tears at the prospect of losing “local control.”
But California’s century-long policy of handing land use policy off to cities and counties has allowed jobs-rich coastal areas to build gilded walls around themselves with segregationist zoning. The result is mass displacement of all but the wealthiest from coastal metros like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego to inland regions like the San Joaquin Valley, the Inland Empire and, increasingly, out of the state entirely. 
Even the most strident neighborhood defenders agree that California is being strangled by a severe housing crisis. According to the Joint Center of Housing Studies at Harvard University, 6 of the top 10 metropolitan areas with the highest share of cost-burdened households are in California. About 1 in 3 renters in the Los Angeles metro area spends 50% or more of their post-tax household income on rent. And as of last year, the city of San Francisco had about 1,000 more homeless people than all of Missouri. 
How we got to this point is not mysterious, nor is it controversial — at least for those who study the issue. For about 40 years, California has simply not produced enough new housing to accommodate demand. 
Further exacerbating this shortage is the fact that the vast majority of California’s new homes are built far away from the coast, even though coastal cities are where the majority of the state’s jobs are located. Land use politics are less fraught in places like San Bernardino or San Joaquin County, where there’s still undeveloped land to sprawl over and where poorer, mostly non-white communities lack the resources to oppose development like their wealthy coastal counterparts. 
The result is an equilibrium that serves no one besides wealthy coastal homeowners. About 11% of San Joaquin County residents and 7.6% of Riverside County residents drive more than 90 minutes each way to get to work. More than just devastating the lives of these commuters — most of whom earn under $49,000 per year and work blue-collar jobs — each of these cars on the freeway is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Also, the displaced newcomers being pushed hours away from their jobs end up competing for scarce housing with inland Californians, making housing more expensive in the regions where there are fewer high-paying jobs. 
Bills like SB 79 are needed because a city’s land use policy has the potential to adversely impact the lives of many thousands more people than the ones currently living within its borders. When costs are borne by everyone, then it is only fair that everyone gets a vote. 
If policy affects the entire state, then it is the state — not the city — that should have the final say.

It can make people sick.,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/salton-sea-smell-health-issues/,UCLA researchers have found that hydrogen sulfide emissions at the Salton Sea are at elevated levels and can cause serious health effects to those that live near the lake.,"In summary
UCLA researchers have found that hydrogen sulfide emissions at the Salton Sea are at elevated levels and can cause serious health effects to those that live near the lake. 


Residents around the Salton Sea have long complained of respiratory ailments from particulate pollution that wafts from its shoreline.
Now UCLA researchers have identified another air pollutant that could be sickening people in communities near the inland lake: hydrogen sulfide.
That’s a gas from decaying, organic matter that produces a rotten egg smell and is associated with eye irritation, headaches, nausea and other symptoms. In a pair of reports released last week, the Latino Policy & Politics Institute at UCLA described how algal blooms produce the gas in the water, and how it wafts across nearby neighborhoods.
“Communities that live next to the shore or within a mile of the shore experience exposure to hydrogen sulfide,” said Consuelo A. Márquez, who authored the reports with Alejandra  López, and Isabella B. Arzeno-Soltero. “We hear stories: ‘my child faces chronic nosebleeds and have had asthma their whole life.’”
The Salton Sea crosses Riverside and Imperial Counties, and is California’s largest lake. By many measures it’s also the most imperiled. Nearly twice as salty as the ocean, it’s polluted by agricultural runoffs and toxic algal blooms. Despite its contamination, the sea is a haven to more than 400 bird species and a key stop on the Pacific Flyway, one of North America’s main bird migration routes. 
California recently created a Salton Sea Conservancy to restore habitat for birds and aquatic life. Community advocates say there needs to be greater focus on the lake’s effect on public health in neighboring communities.
“They need help getting treatment, getting medication, or care related to possible cardiovascular and respiratory issues,” Márquez said. “It’s happening at such high rates that a lot of them just live with it. I think there should be more attention put on that.”
The UCLA studies aimed to highlight those problems by measuring hydrogen sulfide emissions at the lake. One study focused on how the chemical is produced in the water. High concentrations of nitrates from fertilizer runoff and low oxygen levels in the water column create an environment that generates hydrogen sulfide gases.
The second looked at hydrogen sulfide concentrations in the air. Researchers installed two additional hydrogen sulfide monitors in the area and found that hydrogen sulfide emissions consistently exceed the California Air Resources Board’s state standard of 30 parts per billion. They recorded 243 hours above this threshold between May and September 2024 alone. 
At those levels – and even at lower concentrations – the chemical can cause a litany of health problems, according to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Those include nausea, eye irritation, headaches, sleep loss, airway problems, fatigue, irritability, poor memory, dizziness and others. 
“As more data highlight connections between water and air-quality, it is crucial to monitor air-quality in all its aspects, not just those related to dust,” the report stated, pointing out that the region is home to primarily Latino, Native American and immigrant residents. “The persistent issue of hydrogen sulfide pollution serves as a clear example of environmental injustice.”
The Salton Sea isn’t the only area with this problem. Hydrogen sulfide emissions also plague areas of San Diego County affected by pollution from the Tijuana River. In parts of South Bay San Diego, researchers with UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC Riverside, San Diego State University and federal agencies found concentrations of hydrogen sulfide about 4,500 times what is typical for an urban area, according to a report released last month.
Márquez said the UCLA researchers are calling for a “holistic systems approach” to improving air quality around the Salton Sea. That could include distributing air purifiers and air quality monitors so residents can play an active role in improving conditions. They also need better access to medical treatment for possible cardiovascular and respiratory issues. Above all, residents want to make sure their concerns are heard and addressed, she said.
“The best people who can create solutions are the people who are affected themselves,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/020423-Salton-Sea_AD_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

Martha “Marty” Van Oot, a distinguished attorney and fierce advocate for justice who was deeply committed to her family and friends, died Sunday, Aug. 17 at her home in Orleans, Massachusetts. She was 73.
Marty was born on November 13, 1951, in Midland, Michigan, to Elizabeth Dawson Oot and Albert P. Oot Jr. She grew up in Westminster, Vermont, graduated magna cum laude from Middlebury College and earned her law degree from Northeastern University School of Law.
Marty served in the NH Attorney General’s Office before turning to private practice and building a distinguished career with several Granite State firms as an admired partner, top litigator, and valued mediator. In 2012, she joined Jackson Lewis in Portsmouth as a partner and practiced there until her retirement in 2021.
She received numerous honors throughout her four-decade career as a litigator, including the NH Campaign for Legal Services’ John R. Tobin Jr. Justice Award for her decades-long work advocating for access to justice, and the NH Women’s Bar Association’s Marilla M. Ricker Award. She was a dedicated supporter of Democratic and progressive candidates and served on numerous charitable and civic boards, including the Granite, Merrimack, and Greater Manchester United Ways; New Horizons, Inc; the New Hampshire Endowment for Health; and the Friends of Norris Cancer Center.
For those who were lucky enough to know her, Marty’s most important legacy will be as a devoted friend and fierce ally whose generosity knew no bounds. She was an anchor of her family, whom she loved beyond reason.
Marty is survived by her son Benjamin Van Oot, his wife Sarah Daly Van Oot, and their children Olivia Van Oot, and Jack, Avery, and Noah Diorio; her siblings Christopher Oot (Sara), Peter D. Van Oot, Laura Oot Sheridan (John), and Betsy Van Oot.
In lieu of flowers, Marty’s family asks friends to consider donations in her honor to the NH Campaign for Legal Services, the Family Pantry of Cape Cod or the Pan-Mass Challenge.

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Hoping to capitalize on public interest in, and outrage over, partisan gerrymandering, a grassroots group of Nevadans has filed a proposed ballot measure to establish an independent redistricting commission and prohibit mid-cycle redistricting.
The group, Vote Nevada PAC, also filed a second proposed ballot question to amend the state’s Voter Bill of Rights to include a provision that could force the two major political parties to open their primaries.
Both petitions were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office on Tuesday, according to members of the political action committee. Both proposals involve amending the Nevada State Constitution, meaning  if they qualify for the ballot, they will have to be approved by voters twice in subsequent elections — 2026 and 2028.
Sondra Cosgrove and Doug Goodman, both longtime advocates for statewide election reform in the Silver State, are behind the efforts. Joining their cause this election cycle is former state Assemblymember Claire (Clara) Thomas, who since leaving office in 2024 has left the Democratic party and registered as a nonpartisan.
The independent redistricting commission proposed by Vote Nevada would be composed of a mix of Democrats, Republicans, and non-major-party voters, reflecting active voter registration splits in the state.
Currently in Nevada, redistricting — that is, the redrawing of the political district boundary lines in order to even out respective populations as regions grow or shrink — is the purview of the Nevada State Legislature, where  lawmakers are, with minimal exceptions, able to draw new maps for their own political gain. The governor can veto the maps.
It is an “indefensible, corrupt process that must change,” argues Vote Nevada.
Nonpartisan and third-party voters comprise 43% of the 2.1 million active registered voters as of August 2025, according to the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office.
The proposed ballot question would limit redistricting to the 180 days following the release of the U.S. Census, essentially barring mid-cycle redistricting efforts like those recently undertaken by the Republican-controlled Texas State Legislature.
Cosgrove believes the blatant political gerrymandering in Texas has brought unprecedented interest in redistricting across the country, making it an ideal time to discuss the issue in Nevada.
In previous years, pitching the independent redistricting commission ballot measure to voters involved a lot of explaining, she said, but right now “it’s not hard to say we want to get rid of gerrymandering in Nevada.”
She continued, “People are at least aware that it’s a thing that’s happening and it’s probably bad. It’ll be easier to educate the public now because it’s in the news everywhere.”
Vote Nevada filed proposed ballot measures to form an independent redistricting commission — in 2020, 2022, and 2024. All three efforts failed to make it in front of voters, either because opponents successfully challenged it in court or because they failed to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot.
In 2024, under the name Fair Maps Nevada, two nearly identical ballot measures to form independent redistricting commissions were deemed “legally deficient” by the Nevada Supreme Court because they did not establish a revenue source to pay for the new body they created.
Cosgrove disagrees with the ruling but in an attempt to address it, the new measure transfers existing funding for redistricting from the legislative process to the independent redistricting commission.
After the filing of a proposed ballot measure, there is a 15-day window for legal challenges. Those legal challenges, which go before a district court and often to the Nevada Supreme Court on appeal, can be a death sentence for proposals, either directly through an unfavorable ruling or indirectly by sucking up time and resources.
The Vote Nevada PAC, in a lengthy brief on the history of efforts to form a commission, urged both major political parties to forgo a legal challenge this time around.
The language of the bill has survived the standard legal challenge just five years ago, they point out. The language was also considered by the nonpartisan Legislative Counsel Bureau earlier this year when Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen sponsored the proposal as a piece of legislation. (Democrats did not give that resolution a hearing.)
It has been thoroughly vetted, the organizers argue, and the political parties should “let the people debate this idea and then cast their votes, as is their right in the Nevada Constitution.”
“I am daring them to sue me,” Cosgrove told the Current. “Sue me and I’m going to spend this whole election cycle ripping them to shreds.”
Cosgrove said she’d be happy to point out to voters that Democrats oppose creating an independent redistricting commission in Nevada where they are the majority party but support creating one in Ohio where they are the minority party.
Similarly, Republicans in Nevada are more supportive of the proposal while their counterparts in red states are opposed.
Thomas, the former Democratic assemblymember, says the leaders of her former party should consider the possibility they might one day find themselves reckoning with a Republican trifecta in Carson City.
“I keep saying that the pendulum is getting ready to swing in a different way,” she said. “Republicans stand a great chance in taking over the leadership. And when that happens they will want to do redistricting, and it will not fare well for the communities that I see.”
In 2021, Democrats controlled the legislature and governor’s mansion and passed a series of new maps that were widely criticized by Republicans, progressive groups, and election advocates.
Thomas’ two terms in the Assembly included that 5-day redistricting special session.
She said the lack of transparency criticized by Republicans and observers also extended into the chambers themselves. Assemblymembers like herself, who did not hold a leadership position, had no say in the process. They were simply expected to show up and vote with what leadership presented.
“We didn’t know anything about how they were divvying up the communities until they divided it up,” she said. “Then it was, ‘This is what it is.’”
Thomas ultimately voted for the maps, as did all Democrats except one, then-Assemblymember (now state Sen.) Edgar Flores. But now she is hoping the process can be changed to get closer to the people.
Vote Nevada doesn’t have deep financial pockets to fight legal battles or pay signature-gathering companies.  “We have $0,” Cosgrove acknowledged.  But the PAC is hoping the moment is right for a grassroots movement to form.
Voter Bill of Rights amendment
Vote Nevada’s second ballot measure would amend the Voter Bill of Rights, which was enshrined in the state constitution in 2020.
The proposed ballot measure would add that all eligible voters have a right “to fully participate in all publicly funded elections without limitation, including, but not limited to, any requirement to affiliate with any private organization, such as a political party.”
Politicians, scared of truly open primaries, offer ‘limited’ alternative for nonpartisan voters

The ballot measure would upend the state’s presidential preference primaries, which are publicly funded but only open to voters who register with either of the two major political parties.
Vote Nevada notes that the political parties would be free to engage in privately funded nominating processes. The Nevada Republican Party last year did just that despite the state mandating a presidential preference primary be held. (That split resulted in “none of these candidates” winning the nonbinding state-run primary and Donald Trump winning the party-run caucus.)
Cosgrove and Goodman have long argued that the growing number of nonpartisan voters are being disenfranchised because they cannot participate in primaries, which are often competitive and sometimes decide the general election.
The duo was heavily involved in 2022 and 2024’s Question 3, which proposed a ranked choice voting and open primary election system. The proposal passed in 2022 but failed to pass in 2024. It faced fierce opposition from both major parties.
Many opponents of that measure suggested they were okay with open primaries and that the problem lay with using ranked choice.
During this year’s legislative session, Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager acknowledged those frustrations. He sponsored a bill to allow nonpartisan voters to participate in either Republican or Democratic non-presidential primaries. The bill passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
When pitching the legislation, Yeager told his peers he feels the dam to open primaries is “going to break one way or another.”
Thomas leaves Democratic party
Thomas described making the decision to register as nonpartisan as “hard pressed.” She had been a loyal Democrat her whole life but became “disenchanted” by what she sees as the party’s lack of leadership and prioritization of lobbyists and special interests.
“It is not the party that my parents taught me about,” she said. “It’s not the party that I grew up with in Nevada.”
Thomas said the decision was not a direct response to the Nevada Senate Democratic Caucus endorsing her competitor last year for the state Senate District 1 Democratic primary, though she acknowledged there was conflict.
“Did I appreciate the leadership telling lobbyists not to support me? And (saying) if they do support me that their bills would not be heard? Those are tactics that I think we see in the Republican party. Never did I think the Democratic party would do that. But they did.”
Thomas lost the Democratic primary in June last year to Michelee Cruz-Crawford, who would go on to win the general election in the solid blue district. Thomas said she didn’t decide to leave the party until later, following a “really thoughtful process” about where the party was headed.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211113_231447010.PORTRAIT-1-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Manufacturing in Utah is “really taking off,” according to the deputy administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, who was in Salt Lake City this week meeting with stakeholders and small business owners to tout some of the impacts now being felt by the “big, beautiful bill.”
According to William Briggs, who was confirmed to be the second-in-command of the administration in July, the most common loan application coming from the Beehive State is for manufacturing — in most states or cities, the most popular loans are for hospitality or accommodations, helping restaurant or hotel businesses. 
But Utah’s growing focus on manufacturing is “unique,” Briggs told Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday, after touring Beacon Commercial Door and Lock, a nearly 60-year-old company that began manufacturing in-house in 2020 and currently employs 64 people. 
Located in South Salt Lake, Beacon credits its success in part to help from the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which helped finance the company’s expansion.

Since 2018, when the company started mulling whether it should manufacture in-house, Beacon says revenue has grown by 28%, its workforce by 22% and its gross profit by nearly 400%. 
The company’s president, Chad Riches, said that’s allowed the company to give better benefits, retirement plans and increase wages. 
“We have more employees that have higher wages, and they pay more income taxes. Because we have more employees, we pay higher employment taxes. The company makes more and so we pay more in taxes,” Riches said on Tuesday, calling it a “return in investment” for the SBA. 
Now, impacts from Congress’ budget bill that passed this summer, known as the “big, beautiful bill,” are being felt by small businesses like Beacon. 
Riches said not taxing overtime and paid or family leave being tax deductible are among the biggest impacts — so is the ability to expense 100% of the manufacturing equipment Beacon bought several years ago to make metal and wooden doors and doorframes at its South Salt Lake factory. 
“It allows us to put time, effort and money into research and development,” said Riches.
Meanwhile, critics of congressional Republicans’ massive tax and spending law have decried the legislation’s impact on health care, as some estimates point to as many as 10 million Americans being at risk of losing medical coverage they receive through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, while states are burdened with higher costs. Democrats contend the tax breaks disproportionately benefit the rich. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But since the law passed, Beacon has ramped up production. It used to produce roughly eight wooden doors each day, now it manufactures 40. It previously would go through about four steel coils — massive coils of steel that can weigh up to 30 tons and are used in door and doorframe production — each year. Now, Riches said, the company goes through 40 coils annually. 
“We never in our wildest dreams thought we could do that,” Riches said. 
Briggs, who was in Utah for a few days this week, said Beacon is “exactly what we want.” 
“This is what the president is ultimately trying to do, to grow manufacturing here — people who produce stuff, people who produce good jobs,” he said. “He’s paying people more, hiring more people, growing his footprint. This is the story we want.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8755-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Federal prosecutors have charged an attorney who represented families in a lawsuit against Alabama’s gender-affirming care ban with a felony charge of making a false statement.
The charge against Carl Charles,  an attorney for Lambda Legal, a national civil rights organization that primarily works on LGBTQ+ issues, comes over six months after U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke reprimanded Charles and two other attorneys for allegedly judge-shopping in the case.
Prosecutors accuse Charles of denying before a three-judge panel investigating that he made a call to U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson’s office “to discuss the filing” and “an upcoming request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,” which prosecutors allege was false.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The charge was filed last month but unsealed on Monday. The news was first reported by Washington, D.C.-based legal journalist Chris Geidner.
Lambda Legal issued a statement on Tuesday supporting Charles against the allegations, calling the indictment an example of government overreach.
“We fundamentally disagree with the characterization of the events that underpin this indictment, which ignores the fact that the routine phone call at issue was acknowledged by the court to be entirely legal and proper,” the law firm said in a statement on Tuesday. “We unequivocally stand behind Carl and all of our attorneys, who adhere to the highest ethical and professional standards every day in pursuit of our mission to advance and defend the rights of LGBTQ+ people.”
The law, enacted in 2022, made it a felony for doctors to prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapies for transgender youth. The attorneys filed and then refiled a lawsuit challenging the law in court.
After a hearing, Burke issued an injunction against the law, ruling that it interfered with parents’ ability to make decisions for their children and that the state failed to prove that the drugs were harmful. In 2023, a three-judge federal panel overturned the injunction. U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down federal abortion protections, ruled there was no constitutional right to gender-affirming care.
The investigation into alleged judge-shopping came in May 2022 after the original lawsuits were withdrawn and refiled.
In February, Burke ruled that Charles and attorneys Melody Eagan and Jeffrey Doss acted in bad faith and attempted to manipulate the court’s random assignment case process to challenge the law.
“The lead attorneys in this case—a high-profile challenge to Alabama state law—tried to avoid their assigned judge by voluntarily dismissing one case and filing anew with different plaintiffs in a neighboring federal district court,” the ruling from Liles states.
Liles publicly reprimanded Eagan and Doss and removed them from the case. Liles also referred the matter to the Alabama State Bar Association. Liles also publicly reprimanded Charles and fined him $5,000. The judge also referred the incident to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Alabama and other licensing organizations.
According to the indictment unsealed on Monday,  Charles, while testifying under oath, first denied that called court staff regarding the matter on the day the lawsuit was filed, but the court then asked another question.
“Speaking of good faith, I want you to think very carefully about this next question and answer you’re about to give,” one of the judges asked according to the complaint. “Are you telling us that you did not call a judge’s chambers and speak to a law clerk about the potential for a TRO in the Walker Case?”
After some hesitation, according to the transcripts, Charles said, “No, your honor.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Frank-M-Johnson-Courthouse-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

Gavin Newsom has been waging a media war against President Donald Trump — particularly with uber-snarky social media posts — while promoting a ballot measure aimed at increasing Democrats’ congressional seats, portraying it as a way to blunt Trump’s lust for power.
Newsom clearly seeks recognition as Trump’s most effective political foe, political pundits of all flavors believe, thus positioning himself as the Democratic Party’s leading presidential hopeful in 2028.
Is it working? In purely political terms, yes. In polling and other tests of political sentiment, Newsom appears to have become the unofficial frontrunner, three years before voters will be electing the next president.
“California Gov. Gavin Newsom has seized attention like no other Democrat in President Donald Trump’s second term as he works to position himself as a de facto head of the resistance in a leaderless party,” a recent Washington Post article declared.
“Influencers on both the left and the right have discussed Newsom online more than any other potential 2028 presidential contender since Trump’s inauguration …  The attention has been driven by his response to immigration raids in Los Angeles, his efforts to counter a Republican redistricting push and, most recently, his mocking impersonations of Trump’s social media style.”
Alex Hoffman, a Democratic strategist and donor adviser, told the Post: “Democrats are so desperate for leadership right now that they’ll take anything they can get. Gavin is filling a void.”
This week, Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini published a simulated Democratic primary, placing Newsom in first place in a seven-candidate field with “a 29.7% chance of winning across 10,000 simulations.” He’s followed by progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a 19.5% chance, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 13.4%, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro at 12.2%, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at 11.3%, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 9.0%, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear at 5.1%. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was not included in the list. 
Ruffini cites Newsom’s “best polling at the moment, the second-best fundraising, and ideological positioning in the middle of the party” as his strongest attributes.
If, indeed, Newsom is laying the groundwork for a 2028 White House bid, he would have to maintain momentum while continuing to govern the state for the next 16 months and move beyond just portraying Trump as the devil incarnate.
In the meantime, his constituents will feel the impact of Newsom’s feud with Trump. For one thing, those who lost homes and loved ones in the deadly firestorms that swept through Los Angeles neighborhoods this year will probably never see a dime of the $40 billion in federal relief funds Newsom and other officials have sought.
Newsom also faces blowback from the universe of right-leaning podcasts, YouTube channels and social media postings. Video clips from some less savory chapters of Newsom’s personal life and political career are already surfacing, such as his infamously unmasked appearance at a birthday party during the COVID-19 pandemic, his affair with the wife of a close friend while mayor of San Francisco and revelations about his drinking habits.
One clip shows Newsom in 2007 criticizing and walking away from a reporter who asked him about the drinking. It’s an example of Newsom’s thin skin, which could be a liability if and when he becomes a presidential candidate. 
Finally, Newsom’s record as governor will be an issue, with critics citing California’s many unresolved issues, such as homelessness, housing shortages, cost of living and poverty. Just this week, the Census Bureau revealed that when the state’s high living costs are factored in, California continues to have the nation’s highest poverty rate at 17.7%, tied with Louisiana.

Sue Carnell, the chief deputy superintendent at the Michigan Department of Education, will take over as interim state superintendent in October and serve until the man who was selected to permanently take the job can step into the role.
The board last month voted to offer the state superintendent job to Glenn Maleyko, who currently is the superintendent for Dearborn Public Schools. On Tuesday, the board approved allowing Pamela Pugh, the president of the board, to negotiate with Maleyko and his attorney on its behalf.
It’s unclear when Maleyko will begin. The board’s timeline for the superintendent search process had set Oct. 4 as the start date for the new leader.
Tom McMillin, a board member from Oakland Township, asked about the start date during Tuesday’s monthly meeting, saying “I’m just wondering if January or April,” or another date. McMillin said there had been some suggestion that Maleyko might need to remain in his Dearborn role through December.
“All I can say is that we are negotiating,” Pugh said.
Carnell will begin as interim superintendent Oct. 3, the last day for current State Superintendent Michael Rice, who is retiring.
She will be the first Black woman to serve as state superintendent in Michigan’s history, according to the MDE.
Carnell has had a 40-year career in education government, according to an MDE news release. She was superintendent in Westwood Community Schools, deputy superintendent in the Detroit Public Schools Community District, and an administrator in the Southgate Community Schools. She has also served as education policy advisor for former Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
Pugh said in the news release that Carnell “is just the right person to lead MDE as we transition to a new state superintendent.” Carnell said she looks forward “to supporting the staff at MDE as we work with our education partners, the governor’s office, legislators, and families to continue the momentum of improving outcomes for children,” according to the release.
In his final remarks as state superintendent at a board meeting, Rice doubled down on criticism he has made recently about the Michigan legislature’s failure to adopt a budget for the current fiscal year. Lawmakers are required by state law to adopt a budget by July 1, but that deadline has come and gone, and there could be a state shutdown if a budget isn’t approved by Oct. 1.
“This is unacceptable,” Rice said. “The failure to pass a budget timely has led to districts being more cautious in their spending decisions, including their staffing decisions this summer into the beginning of the school year.”
He said some districts are now informing parents that some programs could be eliminated or will be eliminated because of the budget stalemate.
The Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House are far apart on how they would fund schools.
During the public comment period of the meeting, the board heard from a number of education leaders who praised Rice for his role in education leadership, including from a tearful Flint Superintendent Kevelin Jones, who said Rice mentored him during his tenure as the district leader. Rice thanked the leaders for their words.
“And I also want to thank the two people who said good riddance to me. Amen to that,” Rice said.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Data centers are the reason for the explosive growth in energy demand, electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to manage rising costs and impacts on ratepayers, Maryland needs to understand the true impacts of data centers on our state.
Rather than flying blind, Maryland should get a handle on planned data center growth and manage the impacts rather than simply react to them after it’s too late. We can be proactive, rather than reactive like Northern Virginia.
In August, our grid operator, PJM, admitted what we have suspected – that the real reason for growing energy demand is not state climate policies like the electrification of cars, trucks, homes and businesses, but rather data centers.
In an Aug. 8 letter to its stakeholders (primarily electric utilities), the PJM Board stated that “PJM’s 2025 long-term load forecast shows a peak load growth of 32 GW [gigawatts] from 2024 to 2030. Of this, approximately 30 GW is projected to be from data centers.” PJM also said that the “onrush of demand has created significant upward pricing pressure and has raised future resource adequacy concerns … and there exists a large cone of uncertainty around the trajectory and amplitude of future growth.”

More simply; increases in electric bills are a direct result of data center growth, it’s getting worse and we don’t know how much worse.
We also may not have enough electricity for all residents and businesses, such as during weather extremes.  For this reason, systems interconnection watchdog, Monitoring Analytics LLC, says that data centers looking to connect to the PJM grid must bring their own power supply.
Rate increases are not theoretical.  According to a July article in Utility Dive, we saw a major price spike in the PJM capacity market auction last year; another 22% increase from a year ago this summer, and PJM expects record-high capacity prices for the 12-month period starting in June 2026, which could lead to 1.5% to 5% bill increases for some ratepayers, depending on the state.
Data centers are driving up current and future costs for electricity capacity and transmission, and raising concerns about electric-system reliability, the Office of People’s Counsel told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in comments filed in July.
Data centers are not just energy hogs; their greenhouse gas emissions are going through the roof. As recently reported in the New York Times, “Google’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 11 percent in 2024 from the year before. Amazon’s were up by 6 percent. Microsoft’s fell slightly but remained 10 percent higher than they were in 2021. Meta’s most recent figures have not yet been made public.” This growth puts Maryland at serious risk of falling far short of our climate goals.
Given all of this shocking data, we are proud that our state legislators understood the wisdom of passing the Data Center Study Bill (SB116/HB 270) this past General Assembly. Unfortunately, Gov. Wes Moore vetoed SB116/HB270, which would have given the state an analysis of the energy implications of data centers (including energy demand); additional transmission and distribution infrastructure needed; the effect on Maryland ratepayers; potential impacts to air and water quality and water quantity; and the benefits in terms of jobs and state revenue.
There is still hope. The General Assembly can override the veto when they come back into session. This is a critical step to ensuring the state has accurate information about data centers to allow us to plan for and have appropriate guardrails to protect ratepayers and our climate.
As the tech industry and utilities meet with state and local policymakers about the benefits of data centers, we urge them to keep in mind what data center growth means for everyday Marylanders and our electric bills.  We need a plan with guardrails to responsibly manage data center growth in our state to avoid high electric bills, unreliable electricity supply, excess water usage and increased climate pollution.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

(Photo by Emily Fitzgerald/Washington State Standard).Washington tribal leaders and environmental advocates are speaking out against the Trump administration’s plan to repeal protections for 2 million acres of national forests in the state.
The U.S. Forest Service has proposed scrapping the so-called Roadless Rule: a federal regulation established in 2001 that prohibits road construction, logging, and mining across millions of acres of national forest land. The rollback would end protections for about 45 million acres nationwide. Public comment on the proposal is open through Sept. 19.
“We are trying to drum up as many comments as we can, telling them that this is absolutely foolhardy and we will not stand for it,” said Lia Brewster, a Northwest conservation campaign strategist for the Sierra Club, during a rally on the state Capitol steps on Monday. 
Volunteers at the Olympia rally gathered opposing public comments from about 120 people.
Rescinding the rule is in line with the Trump administration’s commitment to remove “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk, but also stifle economic growth in rural America,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement last month.  
As opposition boils up, industry groups, like the American Forest Resource Council, are endorsing the administration’s move, saying that leaving the forests off limits has allowed them to grow too dense, raising the risks of wildfires and tree disease. 
Opponents counter that the Roadless Rule allows for wildfire mitigation in the protected areas and argue that more human activity in the forests will increase fire risks. 
More than 95% of the areas under the Roadless Rule are in 10 Western states, including roughly 2 million acres in Washington state and an additional 2 million acres in Oregon. 
Washington lands protected by the Roadless Rule include forests around the edges of Olympic National Park and Mt. Rainier National Park, near Lake Quinault, Mt. Baker and Washington Pass, and much of the Kettle Range in northeast Washington.
“The roadless areas are the marrow of the bone. They are the core of the core, and the most important that we have,” Brewster said. 
In the Olympic National Forest, the Roadless Rule protects critical salmon spawning habitat, according to a map developed by the forest advocacy group Sportsmen for Wild Olympics. 
“Rescinding the Roadless Rule is yet another attempt to hand over our essential public resources to special interests — at the expense of salmon, clean water, and future generations,” said Ashley Nichole Lewis, a Quinault Indian Nation fishing guide and spokesperson for Sportsmen for Wild Olympics. 
The Trump administration first announced its intent to rescind the Roadless Rule in June. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced late last month it had taken the next steps to do so by filing a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 
The Olympia rally was the second of nine stops for the Indigenous-led campaign “Xaalh and the Way of the Masks” protesting the planned repeal of the rule. 
Launched by the Lummi Nation’s House of Tears carving family and the Indigenous-led nonprofit Se’Si’Le on Saturday, the two-week campaign involves taking a newly carved totem pole and 10 cedar spiritual masks on a 1,700-mile journey between rally venues in Washington and Oregon before delivering them to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe west of Port Angeles on Sept. 20. 
“These masks, they represent transformation. They represent leadership,” said Lummi Nation Master Carver Jewell James, adding that the masks and the campaign are intended to inspire people to turn away from environmental destruction and take action.  
“We cannot give up. We cannot believe that this country is voiceless,” James said. 
Volunteers are collecting public comments from rally attendees at every stop along the campaign. About 200 comments against the repeal were collected at the campaign’s first stop in Bellingham, according to Brewster. 
The campaign’s next stops are Portland, Eugene and Hood River in Oregon, followed by Asotin, Seattle and Port Angeles in Washington. 
The Way of the Mask campaign involves Indigenous leaders working alongside various churches and environmental groups, including Disciples of Christ, Unitarian Universalist, the Sierra Club, Center for Responsible Forestry, Washington Conservation Action, Intercommunity Peace and Justice Center, Save Our Wild Salmon. 
“We have to remember everything we can do for these forests will matter in the future,” Unitarian Universalist Rev. Florence Caplow said during Monday’s rally. 
Independently from the campaign, local environmental advocacy groups such as Washington Wild, Conservation Northwest, the Washington Trails Association, Kettle Range Conservation Group and The Mountaineers are encouraging Washington residents to submit public comment this month opposing the repeal of the Roadless Rule. 
Sportsmen for Wild Olympics is one of several advocating for Congress to pass the Wild Olympics Wilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which would establish new protections for 126,000 acres of forest and 464 miles of river on the Olympic Peninsula. 
Washington Sen. Patty Murray has pushed the legislation for years, and freshman U.S. Rep. Emily Randall, who represents the Olympic Peninsula, has introduced a version in the House. The legislation is controversial, with opponents saying it would hurt the timber industry and the region’s economy.

It was filed late last month.,"A highway is pictured under construction. (Courtesy Indiana Department of Transportation)Indiana’s Department of Transportation has asked its federal counterpart to temporarily excuse it from diverse contractor requirements, which the state’s attorney general has dubbed “unconstitutional.”
The Hoosier State is the first to request a waiver, filing with the U.S. Department of Transportation late last month, according to a Tuesday news release. The move was prompted by a preliminary injunction in a federal case featuring a disgruntled Indiana subcontractor.
“I am a firm believer in offering equal opportunity for all to compete and succeed,” Gov. Mike Braun said in the release. “If granted, this waiver will further position Indiana as a state one would want to do business with and as a place to grow your business.”
Braun administration seeks legal opinion on business diversity programs

U.S. Department of Transportation regulations require state and local transportation agencies that receive highway, transit and airport assistance to establish contracting goals for the participation of “disadvantaged business enterprises” that are majority owned and controlled by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.”
Anyone can qualify as disadvantaged — subjected to racial, ethnic or cultural prejudice — on a case-by-case basis. But some are presumed to be disadvantaged: women and Black, Hispanic, Native and Asian Americans.
There are personal net worth, business size and gross receipts standards, however.
“Forcing INDOT to prioritize contractors based on race or gender is unconstitutional and undermines fair competition,” said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who authored a Friday letter in support of the agency’s waiver request.
The letter, also signed by the attorneys general of 16 other states, argued that white or male business owners don’t benefit from the “race and gender presumption.” That’s “plainly” discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional, the letter added.
In the release, Rokita said a granted waiver “would be a critical step toward ensuring that Indiana’s transportation projects are awarded based on merit, not arbitrary classifications, and aligns with our constitutional duty to uphold equal protection under the law.”

Under its proposed waiver, INDOT would go “race- and gender-neutral.”
A new methodology for setting goals and certifying businesses would consider how available economically disadvantaged small businesses are in certain geographies and industries, according to the release.
The agency asked for a three-year exemption, which would end around the time the agency’s next disparity study is expected to be complete. The results will be used to create a new disadvantaged business goal based “solely” on economic criteria.
INDOT will keep offering business development programming, virtual learning, forums and networking events to “DBEs across Indiana.”
It’s the latest step state officials have taken against diverse contracting efforts.
Braun’s Department of Administration is also seeking an opinion from Rokita’s office about the legality of the Governor’s Commission on Supplier Diversity and the Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises Program.
That agency’s Division of Supplier Diversity has called off its next meeting until the review is completed, although opinions are non-binding. The division has also canceled its annual Business Conference and B2Bloom Expo, which showcases opportunities for underrepresented companies to contract with state government.

(Getty Images)While the White House’s fight with elite universities such as Columbia and Harvard has recently dominated the headlines, the feud overshadows the broader and more far-reaching assault on K-12 public education by the Trump administration and many states.

The Trump administration has gutted the Department of Education, imperiling efforts to protect students’ civil rights, and proposed billions in public education cuts for fiscal year 2026. Meanwhile, the administration is diverting billions of taxpayer funds into K-12 private schools. These moves build upon similar efforts by conservative states to rein in public education going back decades.
But the consequences of withdrawing from public education could be dire for the U.S. In our 2024 book, “How Government Built America,” we explore the history of public education, from Horace Mann’s “common school movement” in the early 19th century to the GI Bill in the 20th that helped millions of veterans go to college and become homeowners after World War II.
We found that public education has been essential for not only creating an educated workforce but for inculcating the United States’ fundamental values of liberty, equality, fairness and the common good.
In the public good
Opponents of public education often refer to public schools as “government schools,” a pejorative that seems intended to associate public education with “big government” – seemingly at odds with the small government preference of many Americans.
But, as we have previously explored, government has always been a significant partner with the private market system in achieving the country’s fundamental political values. Public education has been an important part of that partnership.
Education is what economists call a public good, which means it not only benefits students but the country as well.
Mann, an education reformer often dubbed the father of the American public school system, argued that universal, publicly funded, nonsectarian public schools would help sustain American political institutions, expand the economy and fend off social disorder.

In researching Mann’s common schools and other educational history for our book, two lessons stood out to us.
One is that the U.S. investment in public education over the past 150 years has created a well-educated workforce that has fueled innovation and unparalleled prosperity.
As our book documents, for example, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the states expanded public education to include high school to meet the increasing demand for a more educated citizenry as a result of the Industrial Revolution. And the GI Bill made it possible for returning veterans to earn college degrees or train for vocations, support young families and buy homes, farms or businesses, and it encouraged them to become more engaged citizens, making “U.S. democracy more vibrant in the middle of the twentieth century.”
The other, equally significant lesson is that the democratic and republican principals that propelled Mann’s vision of the common school have colored many Americans’ assumptions about public schooling ever since. Mann’s goal was a “virtuous republican citizenry” – that is, a citizenry educated in “good citizenship, democratic participation and societal well-being.”
Mann believed there was nothing more important than “the proper training of the rising generation,” calling it the country’s “highest earthly duty.”
Attacking public education
Today, Mann’s vision and all that’s been accomplished by public education is under threat.
Trump’s second term has supercharged efforts by conservatives over the past 75 years to control what is taught in the public schools and to replace public education with private schools.
Most notably, Trump has begun dismantling the Department of Education to devolve more policymaking to the state level. The department is responsible for, among other things, distributing federal funds to public schools, protecting students’ civil rights and supporting high-quality educational research. It has also been responsible for managing over a trillion dollars in student loans – a function that the administration is moving to the Small Business Administration, which has no experience in loan management.
The president’s March 2025 executive order has slashed the department’s staff in half, with especially deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights, which, as noted, protects student from illegal discrimination.

Trump’s efforts to slash education funding has so far hit roadblocks with Congress and the public. The administration is aiming to cut education funding by US$12 billion for fiscal year 2026, which Congress is currently negotiating.
And contradicting its stance on ceding more control to states and local communities, the administration has also been mandating what can’t and must be taught in public schools. For example, it’s threatened funding for school districts that recognize transgender identities or teach about structural racism, white privilege and similar concepts. On the other hand, the White House is pushing the use of “patriotic” education that depicts the founding of the U.S. as “unifying, inspiring and ennobling.”
Promoting private education
As Trump and states have cut funding and resources to public education, they’ve been shifting more money to K-12 private schools.
Most recently, the budget bill passed by Congress in July 2025 gives taxpayers a tax credit for donations to organizations that fund private school scholarships. The credit, which unlike a deduction counts directly against how much tax someone owes, is $1,700 for individuals and double for married couples. The total cost could run into the billions, since it’s unclear how many taxpayers will take advantage.
Meanwhile, 33 states direct public money toward private schools by providing vouchers, tax credits or another form of financial assistance to parents. All together, states allocated $8.2 billion to support private school education in 2024.
Government funding of private schools diverts money away from public education and makes it more difficult for public schools to provide the quality of education that would most benefit students and the public at large. In Arizona, for example, many public schools are closing their doors permanently as a result of the state’s support for charter schools, homeschooling and private school vouchers.
That’s because public schools are funded based on how many students they have. As more students switch to private schools, there’s less money to cover teacher salaries and fixed costs such as building maintenance. Ultimately, that means fewer resources to educate the students who remain in the public school system.
Living up to aspirations
We believe the harm to the country of promoting private schools while rolling back support for public education is about more than dollars and cents.
It would mean abandoning the principle of universal, nonsectarian education for America’s children. And in so doing, Mann’s “virtuous citizenry” will be much harder to build and maintain.
America’s private market system, in which individuals are free to contract with each other with minimal government interference, has been important to building prosperity and opportunity in the U.S., as our book documents. But, as we also establish, relying on private markets to educate America’s youth makes it harder to create equal opportunity for children to learn and be economically successful, leaving the country less prosperous and more divided.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-640128687-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Neighbors have spent a decade fighting to acquire the Roof Depot warehouse in the East Phillips neighborhood of Minneapolis, where a former pesticide plant has left toxic arsenic in the soil. 
The neighbors’ vision is to transform the site into a community cornerstone that would bring much needed resources and climate resilient infrastructure to the historically neglected neighborhood. 
In 2016, the city bought the site with plans to demolish the building — which would bring even more pollution into the overburdened neighborhood by disturbing the soil — and turning it into a public works yard. 
A wave of public backlash and a 2023 protest stopped the demolition of the Roof Depot, giving the East Phillips Neighborhood Institute a chance to begin the work to place it in community hands. People in East Phillips and the city then struck a deal to transfer ownership of the Roof Depot building to EPNI for community stewardship of the long-disputed site. It was contingent on the Legislature coming through with some financial help, however.
A sign urging neighbors to call Mayor Jacob Frey and ask that the Roof Depot site be sold to the EPNI is stapled to a telephone pole Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025.
By working with nonprofits, donors, and local lawmakers, EPNI has already accrued $10.2 of the $16 million price set by the city for this site, even though it’s only worth $3.7 million, according to a recent appraisal. 
This past spring, EPNI worked with legislators to secure a $5.7 million appropriation, but this funding was lost in last-minute, large-scale local funding cuts, the result of federal budget cuts resulting in sudden and unexpected withdrawals of appropriations previously agreed to by the State Legislature. 
There’s a simple solution to this problem, however: Minneapolis can simply drop the requirement for EPNI to pay the outstanding $5.7 million altogether.
Despite legal and public backlash from the get-go, the city spent millions from a public Water Fund to plan and design their public works project plan for the Roof Depot site. 
But EPNI did not spend this money, the city of Minneapolis did.
Minneapolis’ Code of Ordinances makes no reference to the need for Water Fund withdrawals to be repaid, and spending money to consider projects that ultimately do not go anywhere is a perfectly normal occurrence in local governance. It’s a sunk cost, and there’s no point trying to recoup it while the site sits fallow even though there’s a plan in place for something better. 
Supporting EPNI’s purchase of the Roof Depot would also help Minneapolis achieve its own established goals.
Transforming the Roof Depot warehouse into a community-owned hub would bring countless benefits to a neighborhood marginalized by decades of underinvestment and environmental injustice.

An indoor farm will provide East Phillips residents with access to affordable and healthy food, grown locally year-round, while the cooperatively-owned rooftop solar farm would power 200+ homes, providing a projected total of $9.4 million in energy savings. The East Phillips Urban Farm will make East Phillips — and Minneapolis as a whole — healthier, wealthier, and more able to weather climate instability to come. 
The East Phillips Urban farm will also advance many of the goals within the city’s Minneapolis 2040 plan. Alongside creating hundreds of jobs, the project would include space for local businesses to operate as commercial tenants and provide career training services for East Phillips residents, contributing to Minneapolis 2040’s goals for more living-wage jobs and a healthy, sustainable, and diverse economy.
Thanks to the introduction of a steady supply of renewable energy via the cooperatively-owned solar farm, it’s easy to see how EPNI’s project contributes to the Minneapolis 2040 goal of achieving an 80% carbon reduction in emissions by 2050. 
The project also includes ecologically restorative agricultural practices with rain gardens, rainwater recycling systems, and urban pollinator habitats. 
Bringing needed resources and opportunities to one of the most racially diverse neighborhoods in the state would bring Minneapolis one step closer to all residents thriving, regardless of race, ethnicity, or zip code — another 2040 plan goal. 
And what better way to express the multifaceted history and cultural offerings of Minneapolis than supporting space for future gathering, performances and art making?
Given that this project contributes to a better future for all in Minneapolis, why wouldn’t the city make it as easy and affordable as possible for EPNI to purchase the Roof Depot site?",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0542-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

Co-hosted by the Pride Center of Vermont, the week features an array of workshops, panels, performances and mixers.

Beth Hankes said her sex shop in Burlington was meant to be “the resource that I hadn’t had.” 
Struggling with sexual health issues and feeling trapped in the corporate world, she noticed a lack of modern, accessible and “joyful” stores selling sex products in the area. So in 2021, she opened Earth + Salt, the first women-owned sex shop in Burlington.
Now a certified sex educator, Hankes runs educational events at the store at least once a month. When Kell Arbor, health and wellness director at the Pride Center, approached the store to ask if they would sponsor Burlington’s first-ever Sex Week, she was so eager that she ended up becoming heavily involved in organizing it. 
The upcoming Sex Week, scheduled from Sept. 14 to 20, features 18 events and runs the gamut from educational panels to art shows and performances to how-to workshops. Earth + Salt plans to host two events, andbut others will take place at the Spiral House, the Karma Birdhouse, the Pride Center and the Burlington Waterfront Park.
Hankes and Arbor pulled together local sex educators as well as their connections in New York and elsewhere to offer the events, that which vary in price from free to roughly $20.
Arbor said Sex Week was partly meant as a counterbalance to Burlington’s more “family-friendly” Pride event, which took place on Sunday. 
“I have been hearing from community members that we need more saucy, juicy, sexy things, not just within Pride, but within the community, centering queer and trans folks,” Arbor said. 
Arbor, whose pronouns are fae/faer, said the events were meant to be LGBTQ+ friendly by nature, but all are welcome. Only two events, mixers for BIPOC Vermonters and bisexual Vermonters, are restricted to people in each of those groups. 
“That’s what equity is about, right? Lifting up the perspectives of people most left out, that we might all see new ways forward,” fae said. 
Arbor said that as an HIV-positive Vermonter, fae have encountered ignorance around sexual health, even among health providers, as an HIV-positive Vermonter. “I’ve seen where the gaps were in my care with doctors saying women don’t get STIs,” or sexually transmitted infections. “That’s very inaccurate. One, I’m not a woman, and two, women get STIs,” fae said. 
Three events are aimedtargeted specifically attoward health practitioners, including one on sexual health for older adults and one on trans-inclusive practices in health care, according to the event website. 
At the same time, the organizers hope to draw people into the conversation by centering and celebrating pleasure in its workshops on kink and other sexual practices. “Pleasure is more of a sustainable invitation in. That’s why I like ‘edu-taining’ models,” Arborfae said. 
Hankes said the event felt will feel like a release point for all the pressures and restrictions that have been building up this year regarding sexual health and marginalized communities. 
“We’re still going to be ourselves,” she said. “We’re still going to have this point of pleasure, education, community and give ourselves access to that, because obviously the government and the current cultural climate is not going to give us that.”
Arbor said events like these feel even more essential in the current political climate. The Pride Center was hit hard by federal funding cuts to HIV prevention earlier this year. 
“When we’re being attacked at our identities because of who and how we love, that’s all the more reason to invite people into education about how we might all free ourselves into more pleasure,” Arbor said. “I’m always like, ‘if we’re too busy having orgasms, we can’t bomb the world.’”

A proposed congressional gerrymander in the Missouri General Assembly would divide the intersection among three congressional district (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline).KANSAS CITY  — A man slept on the cool, gray steps of Independence Boulevard Christian Church, the building and its columns shielding his body from the midday sun on a recent weekday. A few others lingered in the shade under nearby trees.
On Monday evenings, the more-than-century-old church in Historic Northeast Kansas City opens its doors to people in need. It offers a free meal, hygiene products, clothing and a medical clinic. Hundreds often come.
President Donald Trump’s nationwide gerrymandering push has now also arrived at the church’s literal doorstep.
Northeast Kansas City currently sits comfortably inside Missouri’s 5th Congressional District, which encompasses much of the city and the surrounding metro area. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, an 80-year-old Democrat who was the city’s first Black mayor in the 1990s, has held the seat for 20 years.
But Missouri Republicans are advancing a redrawn congressional map through the state legislature that aims to give the party a political advantage. It would crack the city’s urban core into three districts — with all of them converging on the corner of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, home to Independence Boulevard Christian Church.
The intersection’s southwest corner, where the church is located, would move into the 4th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Mark Alford, a second-term Republican who was previously a TV news anchor. The southeast corner, a parking lot, would stay in a 5th District reshaped to embrace a much more rural and conservative constituency.
The northern side, lined by red-brick apartments and a meat market, would join the 6th District. Held by Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves since 2001, it would stretch across the state to the Illinois border.
Residents say they fear that dividing the area, with its complex interplay of problems and positive qualities, will dilute their voice in Washington, D.C.
“We need somebody to understand what poverty looks like,” the Rev. Mindy Fugarino, the church’s senior pastor, told Stateline as she described her problems with the gerrymander and how it will weaken the neighborhood’s representation.
“We need somebody to understand, what are the needs for housing,” Fugarino said. “We need somebody to understand what are the needs for fair wages and health care and those kind of things in a community where people are literally living and sometimes dying on the street.”

The Missouri House passed the new map in a 90-65 vote Tuesday, sending it to the state Senate. The Senate could begin work on the map as early as Wednesday.
The Missouri gerrymander marks the latest example of a Republican-controlled state heeding Trump’s call to redraw congressional districts. Creating more GOP-leaning districts would maximize the party’s chances of retaining control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections.
Democrats, both in Missouri and across the country, have condemned the effort as election-rigging. California has retaliated by asking its voters to approve a Democratic gerrymander. Republicans say they want to ensure Congress can advance Trump’s priorities, and they emphasize that federal courts allow partisan gerrymandering.
In Kansas City, the redistricting plan has set off a bitter political battle that’s left many people feeling angry and dismissed. Stateline spoke with residents, business owners, activists and local officials in Northeast Kansas City, where three districts would divide the area, to better understand the consequences of the national gerrymandering effort at the local level.
Northeast Kansas City residents and others broadly described a diverse, multicultural community with beautiful architecture, a strong civic fabric and neighborhood pride. In the blocks immediately surrounding the intersection of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, less than a third of residents are non-Hispanic white, according to census data.
At the same time, homelessness and crime can be a part of life. Residents are balancing a need for local investment against the risks of gentrification. The poverty rate fluctuates wildly within the area, from less than 12% of residents in some blocks to more than 63% in others. Vacant storefronts are sometimes only a short walk from colorful, tidy houses.
Most community members Stateline spoke with oppose the redistricting effort.
“Nobody asked for this,” said Edgar Palacios, the founder of Latinx Education Collaborative and Revolución Educativa, nonprofit organizations based in Northeast Kansas City that seek to foster Latino representation in education locally. His own home would move into the 4th District under the plan.
Palacios, the son of Nicaraguan immigrants, worried the gerrymander would lead to new representatives for the area who won’t understand the challenges of an urban environment.
“They’re not going to understand the nuances of urban public education and they’re not going to appreciate the differences in how money gets spent or why it gets spent that way or why it’s necessary to do certain things,” Palacios said.
Dan Smith runs Eleos Coffee House on Independence Avenue. The 14-year-old coffee shop is a nondenominational Christian ministry that Smith said draws in both people coming to just work or hang out and individuals off the street wanting help.
Smith declined to offer an opinion on the redistricting proposal, but said he hoped politicians will “totally forget about those lines” when making decisions.
“Because that’s what we have to do here at Eleos,” Smith said. “We can’t draw lines, you know — ‘well, as long as you’re in this group of people or as long as you don’t identify this way or as long as you don’t do this’ — I mean, that’s not helpful for anybody.”
 Republicans say maps are improvement

State Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, presents legislation that would redraw Missouri’s congressional map to a House committee on Thursday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Trump set off a gerrymandering rush this summer in an effort to shore up Republican chances to keep control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
He initially demanded Texas redraw its maps to potentially provide up to five additional GOP seats, and has since urged Republicans in other states to do the same. California has retaliated and other Democratic states may follow.
Republicans in Missouri and elsewhere have been upfront that they are shuffling the map with the intention of improving their party’s standing and say their efforts are in line with a U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision that greenlit political gerrymandering. Missouri Republicans add that their proposed map splits fewer counties and cities than the current one.
“It is an improvement; it is a reform of our current congressional map,” state Rep. Dirk Deaton, the Republican sponsor of the legislation, said at a hearing last week in Jefferson City.
Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who called a special session to pass the map, said the state’s “conservative, commonsense values, rooted in faith, family and freedom, should be truly represented at all levels of government.” He also wants lawmakers to pass a measure that would pose new hurdles to citizen-proposed constitutional amendments.
Kehoe’s office released only rough outlines of the map. After redistricting legislation was introduced in the Missouri General Assembly last week, Stateline produced a detailed map based on census block information supplied by the Missouri House that shows three congressional districts would meet at Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
Republicans already hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats. Cleaver is one of two Democrats, along with U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of the 1st Congressional District in St. Louis.
At most, the new map would likely enable Republicans to take the 5th Congressional District — a single seat — at the cost of a divided Kansas City.
“Two words. One is ‘horrible’ and the second is ‘divisive,’” Cleaver told reporters in Kansas City recently, summing up his reaction to the map.
Cleaver has promised to file a federal lawsuit challenging the map if it passes (other opponents are expected to file lawsuits in state court as well). Giving one example of how the gerrymander would affect the region, Cleaver said Kansas City Public Schools would have multiple U.S. representatives under the map.
“It’s conceivable that two members of Congress could be fighting each other when legislation occurs where one party takes a position and the other party takes the opposite position,” Cleaver said. “That’s absolutely crazy.”
Kansas City is home to some 516,000 people in an overall metro area of 2.2 million. The city is in the midst of a sports golden era that has been a boost to local pride: The Kansas City Chiefs have appeared in five Super Bowls over the past six years and won three; the city hosted the NFL Draft in 2023; it will host World Cup soccer matches next summer. Music star Taylor Swift’s frequent visits to the metro area to see fiancé Travis Kelce, the Chiefs player, have helped, too.
But gun violence remains a persistent problem. As other major cities have experienced falling homicide rates coming out of the pandemic, Kansas City broke its homicide record in 2023. Killings then fell last year, but nonfatal shootings jumped.
Kansas City leaders say their options to respond are constrained. Unlike nearly every major American city, Kansas City doesn’t control its police force. Instead, city-funded officers are overseen by commissioners almost entirely appointed by the governor, a policy with Civil War-era roots. And Missouri lawmakers have almost entirely preempted the city’s ability to restrict firearms.
For some Kansas Citians, the gerrymandered map strikes them as only the latest instance in a long history of Missouri exercising power with little regard for residents. The map cuts much of Kansas City into two along Troost Avenue — once a dividing line during the era of racial redlining that is still shorthand today for the split between the city’s predominantly white and Black neighborhoods.
“It’s sad that they go to this length to try, in my opinion, to disenfranchise people,” said Lonnie Beattle, a retired postal worker who said she lives in the 18th Street and Vine Street neighborhood that’s south of the Northeast Kansas City area.

 Kansas City low point


U.S. Rep Emanuel Cleaver walks through the Missouri candidate filing process in February 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The gerrymander marks a low point in the relationship between Kansas City and the Missouri Capitol, said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
But the second-term mayor, who has battled with Republicans over control of police funding, said that in this instance, the moves by lawmakers have very little do with “purported misbehavior” by the city and more to do with Trump’s demands.
Lucas said carving up Kansas City would mean city officials would have to engage in more lobbying work and more outreach to members of Congress.
“It just adds bureaucracy to a process that currently doesn’t really need it,” Lucas said. “I think everything is working fine right now. One might ask, why change? But obviously, because the president said so.”
While nearly everyone approached by Stateline voiced opposition to the proposed map, the sentiment wasn’t unanimous.
Laura Birdsong, who lives in Northeast Kansas City and calls herself conservative, said that while she understands the concerns, she also sees positives.
“I don’t think it’s an attempt to control, I think it’s an attempt to balance,” Birdsong said as she drove an all-terrain vehicle along Independence Avenue on Friday, shuttling people to and from a local food festival.
Kate Barsotti, a longtime resident of Columbus Park, a neighborhood on the western edge of Northeast Kansas City, said she knew immediately that the gerrymander would be a threat to the neighborhood, dividing it between the 4th and 6th districts. But she suggested the decision could backfire on Republicans.
Barsotti, like others interviewed, emphasized what she views as the absurdity of a congressional district that includes Kansas City stretching all the way to the Illinois border on the eastern edge of the state. Many say that placing so many rural areas into the same district as a dense urban city could upset rural, conservative voters as well.
“So if you want to fight, you’ve just declared war on your own constituents, and I can go anywhere in the state of Missouri and say to them, ‘They don’t care about you,’” Barsotti said.
Some Democrats suspect the party could potentially flip the 4th District, currently held by a Republican, if Kehoe’s proposed map is enacted. Its current boundaries include substantial rural areas but exclude most of the Kansas City metro region. Under the new map, the 4th would slice deep into Kansas City, swallowing up downtown and a lot of Democratic voters in the process.
Lucas said if the map takes effect, he would consider running in 2026 in the 4th District, where he would live. Everyone who cares about representation for Kansas City owes it to the community to make Republicans spend real resources, he said.
“And so I expect there to be a real congressional race,” the mayor said.

The Rev. Mindy Fugarino, senior pastor of Independence Boulevard Christian Church, sits inside the church’s sanctuary on Monday, Sept. 8. Fugarino opposes a plan to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional districts (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline).
At Independence Boulevard Christian Church on Monday afternoon, preparations were already underway for that evening’s meal.
Tables and chairs were set up in a large basement hall, with a separate space available for families. Fugarino, the pastor, said the church expected to serve some kind of ham-and-turkey casserole.
In a few hours, their guests would arrive.
Later that afternoon and 150 miles away at the state Capitol, lawmakers would begin debating the bill that would split apart the crossroads of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
“I think the whole point,” Fugarino said in an interview about the gerrymander, “has nothing to do with trying to address what citizens are actually needing.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Election observers and immigration advocates are alarmed about a new Trump administration push to bar nonprofits from registering voters at federal naturalization ceremonies, saying the policy shift represents an effort to suppress voters.
The change, made by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, upends a decades-long tradition by nonpartisan groups like the League of Women Voters, whose members estimate they have registered hundreds of thousands of new citizens at such ceremonies.
Melissa Marks, who works with the league’s New Jersey chapter, called the new policy “a blatant attempt to keep new citizens from accessing and exercising their full rights.”
“By shutting us out and other civic partners as well, this policy change makes it harder for new citizens to register to vote, and it’s yet another intimidation tactic and an attack on our immigrant community,” Marks said. 
Spokespeople with Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to answer questions, referring the New Jersey Monitor to an alert the agency issued on Aug. 29.
That alert says the change was necessary to eliminate “the administrative burden on USCIS to ensure that those nongovernmental organizations who provide voter registration services are nonpartisan” and cited “USCIS interests in judiciously deploying limited agency resources.”
The alert noted that new citizens can register to vote online, reducing the need for nonprofits to help them do it at naturalization ceremonies.
“This change in no way impacts new citizens’ access to information and applications to register to vote, as this information will continue to be provided by state or local election officials, or USCIS staff at the end of naturalization ceremonies,” the alert says.










This is really a move that is designed to disenfranchise voters and take their political power away.


– Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice


Zhang Mazi, 33, of Jersey City, said he saw no state or local officials on hand Monday to register voters when he became a U.S. citizen at a naturalization ceremony at the Peter W. Rodino Federal Office Building in Newark. A federal official who spoke to the new citizens told them they should vote in elections but offered no guidance on how to do so, Zhang added.
“Most of the speech was focused on how to get a passport. There was no, like, outside support coming to tell people how they can register to vote. So people just kind of went home,” Zhang said. “I really think that’s a huge missed opportunity.”
He did get a take-home handout that contained a paragraph informing new citizens they can register to vote in person, by mail, at public assistance offices, or when renewing driver’s licenses — without details on how. The handout directed readers to vote.gov.
Nuzhat Chowdhury, director of the democracy and justice program at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, noted that the policy change comes amid an uptick nationally in voter ID laws that groups like the League of Women Voters say promote voter suppression, especially in marginalized communities, as well as President Donald Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud by undocumented immigrants. Researchers have examined Trump’s claim and say they have found very few instances of noncitizens voting.
“This new policy pretends to fix a problem that doesn’t actually exist, and it also makes people doubt the integrity of our voting process, which is the sort of fear-mongering about voting rights and democracy that we’ve seen the current administration proliferate again and again,” Chowdhury said.
Amy Torres is executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, which does voter registration work, including at naturalization ceremonies.
Many immigrants have language barriers and a distrust of the government, and without the assistance of trusted volunteers to help them register, the number of new citizens who become voters could fall, Torres said. Some believe citizenship automatically grants them voting rights and don’t understand they must register to be able to vote, she added.
Preventing nonprofits from registering voters at naturalization ceremonies likely will have an outsized impact in New Jersey, a state that has the highest proportion (along with New York) of foreign-born eligible voters of any state besides California, Torres said.
Nineteen percent of eligible voters in both New Jersey and New York are naturalized citizens, with that figure at 21% in California, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center report. More than 45,500 people became citizens in naturalization ceremonies at Citizenship and Immigration Services offices in Newark, Cranbury, and Mount Laurel in the 2024 fiscal year, with another 47,224 so far in the current fiscal year, according to federal data.
“This is really a move that is designed to disenfranchise voters and take their political power away,” Torres said.
She pushed back on immigration officials’ complaints that vetting nonprofits had become a burden or a problem of limited resources.
“There’s a huge naturalization backlog, so I don’t think it’s voter registration that’s causing burdens to the system,” Torres said. “It’s pouring money into enforcement and away from the part of the system that helps people towards pathways to reprieve or pathways to citizenship.”
Marks, of the League of Women Voters, echoed that pushback.
“It’s a burden to ask the USCIS staff to do another job on top of the job they already have. We’re here to help lift that burden. We’re well-respected, well-known for our deep history in being a nonpartisan organization. So we’re not sure what the concern is here,” Marks said.
Spokespeople from the New Jersey Department of State did not respond to a request for comment about whether state election officials would fill nonprofits’ absence at naturalization ceremonies. Chowdhury isn’t betting on them.
“If state and local election offices are the only ones who can now register folks at the naturalization ceremonies, it really depends on their capacity, and we see that they already are stretched thin,” Chowdhury said. “So less folks are going to get registered to vote. Eventually, that does result in voter suppression.”
Marks noted that nonprofits have not been blocked from naturalization ceremonies in federal courts, and the League of Women Voters will continue its voter registration efforts there, while also strategizing how to register new citizens to vote elsewhere.
“We’re not giving up,” Marks said. “We’re still 100% committed to reaching this community.”

Now, they’re, according to one state senator, the “most complicated” in the nation.
Yep, you read that right:  More – not less – complicated. (With taxes, most people prefer “less.”)
To determine your residential property taxes, you’ll now need a compass, protractor, sextant and slide rule to connect the dots to decipher what lawmakers did. And suppose you do unlock that Da Vinci Code: Then you’ll need a lawyer and accountant to challenge your home’s rising taxable value and tax liability, a cardiologist to place a stent to prop open your coronary artery, and a priest to impose penance to absolve your state sins.
Welcome to this edition of the Homeowner Property Tax Shell Game, hosted by Gov. Greg Gianforte and most of your legislators, and led by the Pied Piper of Complicated Legislative Legerdemain, Rep. Llew Jones, the Conrad Republican who serves as de-facto director of much of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the state House and Senate.
First, some background: In 2023, the Legislature and Gianforte raised the state portion of homeowners’ property taxes by about $219 million over two fiscal years. Then they proceeded to spend your hard-earned money.
Montanans expressed outrage, and county commissioners sued Gianforte over a state tax hike as he tried to blame elected county officials for raising state property taxes.
Democrats and Republicans waited until the very end of the 2025 Legislature to pass an even more complicated residential property tax system that requires more – not fewer – taxpayer dollars to hire new state employees to administer the program.
Yep, they cobbled together a more complicated tax system and added bureaucracy under a Republican administration.
Some lawmakers – Democrats and Republicans – have been crowing about this so-called residential property tax “relief.” Don’t believe them. It’s a way of saying, “We picked lots of cash out of your pocket in ‘23, passed complicated legislation this year that gives you some dough back, and raises taxes on select Montana homeowners.”
Right-wing Republicans and some Democrats tried to call out the hypocrisy of the last-minute legislation, which includes rebates that don’t necessarily pay you back for the built-in 2023 residential property tax hike.
The new law, meanwhile, creates a tiered tax-rate system for residential property that generally will result in urban homeowners in high-growth areas paying more property taxes in coming years. Families that own a second home, like a family cabin, will pay even more in property taxes (an estimated 68% more by 2026) because so-called “second homes” are exempt from “relief.”
“The new law doesn’t distinguish between family cabins owned by Montana residents and luxury real estate owned by out-of-state residents,” the Montana Free Press noted.
The 2023 property tax hike socked homeowners while big corporations, railroads and utilities got tax breaks. Now, some lawmakers are complaining that some commercial and industrial businesses will see property tax hikes under the new system. But one lawmaker noted these business entities will just pass their tax increases on to consumers. (Utilities, for instance, didn’t cut consumer rates when they got property tax breaks in 2023.)
Montana voters didn’t think the 2025 Legislature addressed this issue well: In a May 2025 poll, 64 percent of Montanans told Middle Fork Strategies that lawmakers did “not well” in addressing property taxes; 25 percent said they did “well” – a negative 39-percentage point difference.
Couple that with the biennial reappraisals that raise your home’s taxable value (national surveys rank Montana poorly in housing affordability). Consequently, the 2025 Legislature gets low marks in addressing that issue. To wit: 74 percent of Montana voters polled said legislators performed “not well” in addressing housing affordability; 14 percent said lawmakers did “well” – a negative 61-percentage point difference.
If lawmakers won’t fix the complicated property tax system, citizens can act and pass a ballot initiative like the constitutional amendment (CI-130) being proposed by a former Bozeman legislator that would cap increases in residential property assessed valuations to 2% annually.
It’s time for legislators to overhaul this complicated property tax system, bring it into the 21st century, and provide real tax relief to Montana homeowners.

Crowley had already said he was planning to enter the race just a day after Gov. Tony Evers announced he wouldn’t be running for a third term in 2026. Evers’ decision not to run has created the first open race for governor in 16 years. 
In a campaign ad, Crowley, 39, highlighted his difficulties in his childhood and his journey to becoming the youngest and first Black person to serve as Milwaukee county executive. 
“I didn’t grow up in the halls of power. I grew up here and here and here,” Crowley said as photos of his previous homes flashed on screen, “Evicted three times as a kid, having to pick up yourself and everything you own off the curb, it’ll break you or it’ll make you.”
The field for the Democratic primary is still shaping up. Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez was the first to launch her campaign, following Evers’ announcement. State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) has also said she is “very likely” to enter the race. Others considering joining the fray include former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Attorney General Josh Kaul and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
The primary election is just under a year away. 
Crowley said in an interview that Evers has served as a “great, steady, calm strength” that the state has needed over the last decade and he “knew that we were going to need some experienced executive leadership to take over” and someone “who’s going to fight for Wisconsinites all across this state.” 
Crowley was elected to be Milwaukee County executive in 2020. He highlighted the fact that he has managed the state’s largest county, including its $1.4 billion budget, guiding it through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Crowley also represented Milwaukee in the state Assembly from 2017 to June of 2020. 
“I didn’t want any child to go through that,” he said of his struggles with poverty and eviction in his early life, “so I became a community organizer. I went on to serve in the state Assembly, where I saw what happens when extremists had total control, and I’d had enough,” Crowley says  in a new campaign ad. “At 33, I returned home elected to lead the largest county in Wisconsin, helping create thousands of new jobs, cutting our carbon emissions in half, balancing the budget, all while delivering the largest property tax cut in our history and convincing Madison to return more money right back to every local community across the state. But the progress we’ve made isn’t nearly enough.”
Crowley told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that his experience in the Legislature combined with his executive experience set himself apart from other potential candidates. He said he knew on Day One he “would hit the ground running to be able to move our entire state forward.”
Crowley will have to run and win statewide, something he hasn’t done before, before he can accomplish that. 
Asked about challenges Democrats could face in competing statewide in 2026, Crowley said it’s important to recognize people’s frustrations with the Democratic party, especially nationally. He said he has shared the frustrations. 
“We haven’t had a cohesive national message that we could get around that would help energize our base and get folks out,” Crowley said. 
Crowley noted that his experience isn’t just with the city of Milwaukee — the county itself is made up of 19 municipalities with varying needs. 
‘When we talk about the issues that we have focused on — balancing the budget, being able to cut taxes, tackling the opioid epidemic, expanding access to mental health services — these aren’t partisan issues. These aren’t rural or suburban or urban issues. These are issues that are affecting every community,” Crowley said. “My goal is to go and talk to all communities, to let them know that I’m not only willing to listen but am willing to allow those voices on the ground, at the grassroots level, to be able to be part of the solution.” 
Crowley said that he has helped deliver for communities outside of Milwaukee County. He takes credit for leading on Act 12, a 2023 bipartisan law that overhauled local government funding in Wisconsin, boosting state payments for communities across the state and provided Milwaukee with the ability to raise its sales tax.
Crowley said that Act 12 was “definitely historic in nature” — providing funding that communities were able to invest in fire and safety, roads, infrastructure and public services — and gave Milwaukee County and other communities a “bit of reprieve,” but it “didn’t fix all our problems.”
“We’ve had a Republican-controlled Legislature for the better of more than 15 years, and so [Evers has] had to work across the aisle, and this is what divided government looks like,” Crowley said when asked if he would’ve done anything different in recent budget negotiations, which left many Democrats dissatisfied. “It’s not the sexiest or the prettiest, but it means that you have to find compromises… I want to make sure that we continue to do what’s right, but also know that there’s more that we can do for working families.”
Crowley said that’s why it’s important that Democrats pick up seats in the state Legislature in 2026 in addition to keeping control of the governor’s office. Democrats are two seats away from flipping the Senate and five seats away from flipping the Assembly. To do so, Crowley said they cannot “continue to defend the status quo.” 
“We have to look forward. We have to talk about the new vision of what Wisconsin needs to look like,” Crowley said. “What fully funded public schools really means? What does it mean to support families who are in need of  child care across this state, and making sure that they have access not to just affordable housing, but we need attainable housing that is available for folks at all different income levels.” 
Crowley said these issues are all at the root of helping address the “affordability crisis.” 
“People are getting less even if they are making more money, and they need a little bit of relief,” Crowley said. “They’re struggling — trying to figure out how they’re going to put food on the table, how they’re going to keep up with rent or their mortgage, and I know exactly what that’s like. I had two loving parents, who had their own issues and struggled to put food on the table.”
On education, Crowley noted that Wisconsin used to provide about two-thirds of the funding that school districts needed. 
“We at least need to revisit that and figure out how we can get back to that level,” Crowley said. 
Child care was one of Evers’ top issues during the most recent state budget negotiations and he secured $110 million in state funding for direct payments to child care providers. That program will sunset in June 2026. 
Asked whether he would take a similar approach to funding for child care centers, Crowley said that the state should “look at the public-private partnerships when it comes down to funding anything and everything.” 
“As it relates to the services that we’ve provided in Milwaukee County, we can have limited resources, but based off of the partnerships that we have created, we’ve been able to move the needle on many of the programs and services that we offer,” Crowley said. “How do we bring the child care providers into the fold and help them come up with ideas that we need in order to fund them, and I do think that businesses can play a role.” 
On affordable housing, Crowley said that the state needs to work to cut down on bureaucracy and “red tape”.
“There’s a lot of bureaucracy, even if the state wanted to invest in both affordable and attainable housing. You have to wait for local approval, and I think both sides of the aisle understand that we can’t wait for the bureaucrats, and we need to cut the red tape with a type of housing that communities are looking for.”
Crowley added that “what works in Milwaukee may not work in La Crosse, may not work in Wausau, may not work in Green Bay” and that he wants to ensure that the state is listening to people in their communities about what is best. 
Crowley added that there’s “going to be time for us to talk about specific policies,” but he is planning on using “the next couple of weeks, next couple of months, to hear directly from those who are impacted and see what solutions they want to see brought to the table.” 
Crowley added that it would take working with the Legislature to get these things done.
“I absolutely think that one of the things that we have lost in politics is the art of compromise,” Crowley said. “Now, compromising means that you’re finding ways to bring results, and that’s what voters care about. They care about the results, not necessarily the process, but compromising doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re giving up our values to get to a place.” 
Crowley said he would commit to having office hours to work with legislators and hear their ideas “no matter what side of the aisle or what letter is behind their name.” He said this type of communication also needs to extend to every community across the state. 
“The issues affecting communities — there isn’t a cookie cutter solution to them, and there’s no one size fits all solution to the issues that are affecting all of our communities,” Crowley said. 
In his campaign video, Crowley also took aim at President Donald Trump. 
“With costs shooting up, we’re all getting less, even if you’re making more. And Donald Trump’s chaos and cruelty means that the Wisconsin that we cherish will perish unless we unite and fight back,” Crowley said. 
Trump will likely be a major factor in the race for governor in Wisconsin, especially in the Republican primary where the field is also still taking shape, but all of the candidates who have announced so far have closely aligned themselves with Trump.
Crowley said he doesn’t doubt Trump and other national Republican groups will try to “put their thumb on the scale for their particular candidate.” 
“We’re going to run a tight grassroots campaign crisscrossing to every community across this state, letting them know my vision, and I want folks to know whether you’re Democrat, Independent or Republican, there’s a place in this campaign for you, because I’m looking to be the governor for all of us,” Crowley said. 
On the Republican side, Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien and Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann have officially launched their campaigns. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who has spoken to President Donald Trump about running according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, has said he plans to announce a decision by the end of the month. 
In a statement, Berrien called  Crowley’s campaign launch “another career politician” jumping into the race. 
“After years of failed leadership from bureaucrats like David Crowley and Tony Evers, Wisconsinites are ready for a builder to take the reins and lead our state to a bright and prosperous future,” Berrien said. “It doesn’t matter who the Democrats nominate — I plan to beat them.”
Crowley said he isn’t worried about “which Republican” he faces in a general election.
“My fear is any Republican who has the potential of winning this race, and that’s why I’m entering this race now, because we have to unify our party. We have to bring new voices to the table. We have to bring independents back into the fold and build a broad coalition that’s not only going to help me become the next governor, but that’s going to help us win the Senate and the Assembly moving forward.”

North Carolina’s 10 U.S. House Republicans are calling for the immediate removal of the magistrate judge, who released a repeat offender charged with murdering a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte light rail.
The attack occurred August 22nd but has drawn national and international attention this week with newly released surveillance footage.
Prior to the unprovoked attack, DeCarlos Brown Jr. was free on a written promise to appear in court for a misdemeanor charge. Multiple media outlets report Brown faced 14 prior charges, many misdemeanors, dating back over a decade. Federal officials could seek the death penalty in the most recent case.
“By releasing a repeat violent offender on nothing more than his written promise to appear, Magistrate [Teresa] Stokes displayed a willful failure to perform the duties of her office and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,” wrote the congressional representatives in a September 9th letter.
“North Carolina’s justice system failed Iryna Zarutska,” said Congressman Tim Moore (NC-14). “Judge Stokes had the chance to protect the public and chose not to. It’s clear that she’s unfit to hold this consequential position and should be removed from the bench immediately.”
The letter is addressed to Chief District Court Judge Roy Wiggins, who has the authority to initiate removal proceedings.
In addition to Moore, the letter is signed by Reps. Gregory F. Murphy, M.D. (NC-3), Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Addison P. McDowell (NC-6), David Rouzer (NC-7), Mark Harris (NC-8), Richard Hudson (NC-9), Pat Harrigan (NC-10), Chuck Edwards (NC-11), and Brad Knott (NC-13).
Moore has also co-sponsored legislation seeking to end cashless bail.
State Auditor Dave Boliek waded into the matter Tuesday announcing that the Office of the State Auditor will formally investigate the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS).
“The recent lawlessness and violence that have taken place on Charlotte’s public transportation raise serious questions about the security measures in place. We will investigate CATS and examine its public safety contracts and operations,” said Boliek.
The auditor’s office has notified Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Metropolitan Transit Commission leadership, and CATS leadership that the investigation will begin immediately.

President Donald Trump keyed in on the murder on social media Tuesday saying that the policies of Democrat-run cities have left criminals to pray on innocent people.
“We have to respond with force and strength. We have to be vicious just like they are. It’s the only thing they understand,” pledged Trump.
Figures show that homicides are down in many large cities since 2020.
Lyles, a Democrat, has called the attack on Zarutska “horrific and senseless.”
In response, the Charlotte mayor has pledged stronger policing across the transit system and increased fare enforcement.
On Tuesday night, Lyles, seeking a fifth term in office, won a crowded Democratic primary, with more than 70% of the ballots cast in the mayoral race. She did not address the media after her decisive win.

The county is holding immigrants — some without criminal records — for longer than anticipated, immigration lawyers say.
The post The Uinta County sheriff decided to raise deputy pay by holding ICE detainees. The arrangement is raising questions. appeared first on WyoFile .","Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp wanted to give his deputies a raise. 
Officers at his municipal counterpart, the Evanston Police Department, earned more per hour. But the Wyoming Legislature’s property tax cuts left the county with less revenue for salary increases.
President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, however, presented an opportunity. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs places to house detained immigrants that the administration wants removed from the country. The Uinta County jail had space.
And so in June, Kopp went before the Uinta County Commission and proposed capitalizing on the deportation drive by holding ICE detainees for a fee.
By holding around 30 ICE detainees a day, Kopp estimated the county could clear more than $500,000 a year, well above the amount he needed to cover his staff raises.  
“As long as President Trump is in [the White House], we won’t have to worry about anything for 3.5 years,” Kopp said, according to a transcript of the meeting recorded by the Uinta County Herald. 
But there are both fiscal and moral risks in increasing his department’s budget on the premise of a steady stream of detained immigrants, critics of the move said. “Making local government dependent on the federal government’s immigration system seems like a dangerous game to play,” Antonio Serrano, advocacy director for the American Civil Liberties of Wyoming, said. 
Kopp is essentially leveraging Trump’s political agenda at the federal level to mitigate the costs of wide-ranging property tax reductions imposed by the Legislature. 
Adapting to cuts
In Wyoming, lawmakers have sliced into the property tax revenues that fund county and local government. Conservative leaders in the House and Senate pushed through a 25% property tax cut during the 2025 legislative session, and local governments statewide have wrestled since with how to maintain services.
Meanwhile, Kopp told county commissioners the salaries he can offer deputies are hampering his ability to recruit and retain good officers. Those budget woes are exacerbated by the Legislature’s property tax cuts, he told WyoFile. 
“Treat them right, pay them well and train them up,” is Kopp’s goal with salary increases, which include the jail staff guarding ICE detainees, he said.

Since the June meeting, Kopp has given his deputies the raises — which will ultimately increase his annual budget for salaries and wages by about $359,000. So far, ICE holds are coming in at the rate he needs to foot the bill, he said. 
“It’s working out as we thought,” Kopp said. 
He is still waiting on the federal government to accept a rate increase to $120 a day per inmate, but said he expects the feds will approve the raise by next month. There are “no issues with that,” he told WyoFile. 
But some of his other stated beliefs at the June commission meeting — that the jail would hold ICE detainees for no more than 72 hours, and that the people the federal agency would book in would be criminals and public safety threats — aren’t holding up, interviews the Uinta County Herald and WyoFile conducted with immigration attorneys and Kopp show. 
Human rights advocates and immigration attorneys worry that as the Trump administration pressures ICE to arrest and deport large numbers of people — White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the target was 3,000 daily arrests — due process and civil rights will suffer and the lengths of detentions will increase. 
In Uinta County, Kopp also described detained immigrants arriving in distress. “There are a few who are definitely scared,” he told WyoFile, “They have somewhat of a panic attack. It’s a scary situation.” 
But as a potential revenue source, the immigrant detention business appears to be booming for now. 
From June 1 through Aug. 27, Uinta County has housed 439 inmates for ICE, for $66 a day, according to invoice data WyoFile and the Uinta County Herald obtained through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. Kopp’s billed the federal government just under $96,000 for those holds. If the federal government does raise rates to $120 per day, that dollar figure would nearly double. 
The $66 per-diem fee was set in 2018. It’s an amount that barely covered Kopp’s costs for holding the inmates at the time, he said. Other agencies with arrangements to hold inmates for ICE, like Sweetwater and Natrona counties, are being paid more. Sweetwater County earns $120, a spokesperson there said this week, and Natrona County is paid $95 a day, Kiera Hett, a spokesperson for that sheriff’s office, told WyoFile in July.

Natrona County has been holding immigrants for ICE on a longer-term basis. More than two dozen detainees in its jail were locked up for six weeks as of Sept. 5. WyoFile profiled one former Casper detainee this month, a Cuban man who grew increasingly desperate as he sat in confinement without a clear avenue to freedom, including through deportation.
Out of public view
Though Uinta County votes reliably conservative, Kopp’s fiscal strategy is generating deep unease among at least some local taxpayers. Kopp is earning money for his department on the backs of policies that separate immigrant families, longtime Evanston resident and local immigration activist Tim Beppler told the Uinta County Herald and WyoFile. 
“When you state that you’re going to engage in those types of activities, and that you’re going to do it for the money, to me that makes it worse,” Beppler said. 
So far, however, the sheriff’s use of his jail to hold immigrant detainees has not spurred widespread opposition. The detentions have been largely happening out of public view. Kopp’s department has not listed people detained for immigration holds on the jail’s publicly available inmate roster since the beginning of August —though the jail continues to hold such detainees. 
Kopp told WyoFile that previous ICE detainees posted to the roster resulted from technical errors, he said. 
Kopp understands his plan will draw criticism, he said. 
“We could definitely be viewed as an arm of their goals,” Kopp said of ICE. “I 100% get that. And I 100% know that it’s a hot topic and not everybody is happy about it. But it’s a way to increase our revenue during a budget shortfall. The opportunity arose … we’re going to take advantage of it.” 
He declined, at least for now, a pitch by ICE officials to enroll his department in a program pursued by a growing number of Wyoming law enforcement agencies that would allow deputies to play a more direct role in detaining undocumented immigrants arrested on suspicion of local crimes. Uinta County, like other southwestern Wyoming communities, has a significant, if still minority, community of Latino immigrants. 
“I want my guys on patrol to concentrate on the citizens of Uinta County,” Kopp said.
But critics like Beppler say Kopp has already allowed the proverbial camel to nose under the tent. “There’s going to be a great deal of pressure to engage more with ICE,” Beppler said. “He’s going to find it difficult to not continue down that road at this point.” 
An old but well-trod debate
During the first Trump administration, Uinta County played host to a fierce debate over immigration detention. Beginning in 2017, private prison companies’ proposals to build a large immigration jail outside Evanston drove years of debate that divided the town and the state. Two prison companies ultimately abandoned the idea of building in the town.
Evanston residents who campaigned against those previous proposals “didn’t want that community to be associated with something that heinous and gross,” Serrano said. “And I think they will probably fight back against [Kopp’s use of his jail for immigrant detention]. Because it’s still gross.”

Earlier this year, a new private prison company made inquiries about building an immigration detention center in western Wyoming, WyoFile previously reported. Though that company focused mostly on Kemmerer, it also made inquiries in Uinta County, according to officials there. 
Uinta County Commission Chairman Mark Anderson told WyoFile in March that he didn’t engage with company representatives.
“All the public hearings, all of these promises of jobs and then these companies pulling out,” Anderson said, “it’s just been so inconsistent that the appetite for it is just not there right now.”
However, Anderson and the other commissioners have backed Kopp’s effort to boost revenue by holding ICE detainees. If the income stream dries up, however, Anderson said it would fall to Kopp to manage the shortage. “Every elected official is responsible for balancing their budgets,” he said. “If revenues decline, the sheriff would have to make hard decisions at that point.”
Short stays for criminal offenders?
When the sheriff pitched the idea to the commissioners, he described a system where the jail would serve as a short stopover for immigrants that ICE was moving about the region.
“When I say ‘holds,’ these are all ICE inmates with criminal records that are picked up elsewhere, not Uinta County,” Kopp said during the June 25 special commission meeting. “They’re dropped off here and they go on from here, no more than 72 hours later.”

One commissioner applauded Kopp for raising funds by helping ICE deport criminals. “These illegal criminals, that as far as I’m concerned, should be deported, we’re helping that process,” Commissioner Eric South said at the meeting, “and that’s important also.”
The Uinta County jail is being used to hold people ICE arrests in Utah, not Wyoming, Kopp told WyoFile and the Uinta County Herald. 
But Kopp and South’s depiction of immigration detainees as criminals does not align with the emerging statistical picture of who is being swept up in ICE’s dragnet. Data indicates ICE is increasingly arresting people without criminal convictions, both nationally and from within Wyoming. 
Under federal law, unlawful presence in the country on its own is a civil offense, not a criminal one. (Entering the country improperly is a crime, but overstaying a visa, for example, is a civil offense.) 
Kopp’s ICE arrangement parameters were first detailed in the Herald’s July 9 edition. Eleven days later, a Salt Lake City immigration lawyer, Carlos Trujillo, challenged the sheriff’s description. “That is a lie,” Trujillo told Utah-based media outlet KSL, “because I can recall at least one of my clients that touched that place and had no criminal record whatsoever.”
Kopp pushed back on Trujillo’s allegation in a Sept. 2 interview with a WyoFile reporter. “I’m not a dishonest man,” he said. Instead, he said, as the summer progressed, he realized it was possible that some people ICE was sending him did not have a criminal record, but that it was difficult for his department to be certain. 
For his part, Trujillo subsequently told the Herald that two of his clients had been detained at the Uinta County jail — one for over five days — and neither had any criminal charges or convictions.  
“Not even a traffic citation. Nothing,” Trujillo said. “Clean records. Yet, they were paraded through Wyoming.”  
One of his clients was working through the naturalization process when arrested by ICE agents, Trujillo said.
Another Wasatch Front immigration attorney, Jared Lawrence, said he had a client held in the Evanston jail who had been in the court process for legal citizenship since 2022. Lawrence’s client had not committed any crimes outside of his illegal entry into the country, the attorney said. They were working to rectify the immigration offense in court. 
All of the attorneys WyoFile and the Uinta County Herald interviewed declined to name their clients, saying they did not have authorization to do so and worried about retaliation from ICE.

One of Utah attorney Nicholle Pitt White’s asylum-seeking clients is a Colombian national married to an American citizen who is expecting their first child in mid-September. ICE transferred the man to Evanston for two days after he was arrested for unpaid speeding tickets, Pitt White told the Uinta County Herald. The man was then transferred to detention in Texas. 
Kopp’s understanding of who ICE would bring to his facility shifted as the summer progressed.  
On July 21, Kopp told the Herald that “we get all information on all individuals’ criminal information before we accept them.” But on Sept. 2, he told a WyoFile reporter that at some point during the summer, he’d noticed ICE detainees arriving at his facility with the letters “NC” on their intake paperwork. Jail deputies learned that “NC” indicates “no charges,” Kopp said.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean they haven’t been charged with a crime before,” the sheriff said, “most of them that we’re seeing are indeed charged with a criminal offense.”
But, he conceded, “I still don’t have a good answer on the NC part.”
Kopp has lent his jail to a system that is increasingly treating people who have sometimes only committed the civil offense of overstaying visas in the same fashion that it deals with criminals, immigration attorneys said. 
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but the Uinta County jail is a jail for criminals,” Trujillo said. “That in and of itself should give pause to anyone that thinks it’s a good idea to have non-criminals there. It’s inhumane and it goes against our American principles.”
Beppler, the local activist, worried about a form of mission creep. “He will not be able to avoid holding people who do not have criminal charges because it’s part of the ICE system at this point,” he said. “My fear is you begin at a small level and it creeps and grows larger.”
Kopp’s prediction that ICE would only keep people in his jail for 72 hours has also not entirely held up. The agency has at times placed people there for stretches of five to seven days, with the longest stay according to Kopp being a detainee who spent 14 days in Evanston. Another inmate spent 10 days. But unlike the inmates held in Natrona County for weeks on end, Kopp said his jail is not serving as an overflow facility for ICE detention centers in Utah. ICE brings people through Evanston as they transport them east or west, Kopp said. 
The majority of inmates ICE is bringing in, he said, are gone within the 72-hour threshold he first described. But because the Uinta County jail’s public, online roster no longer includes ICE detainees, it’s difficult for the public to assess who is in the jail and for how long.  
Public rosters and detainees
Over the course of the summer, Herald journalists noted what appeared to be a disappearance of ICE detainees from the jail’s online, public roster. 
Throughout June and July, the jail’s public roster showed a number of immigration holds in the facility. A Herald reporter and editor noticed immigration holds were listed often, and in some cases, names were repeated on the roster for days. 
At the beginning of August, immigration holds stopped appearing in the online roster. The Herald journalists continued to monitor the roster throughout the month and never saw another immigration hold. But during that month, Kopp said the jail held as many as 150 immigrants for ICE.

When WyoFile asked about the apparent change to his roster, Kopp said there had been no policy shift regarding which inmates his department listed publicly. Instead, he said the previous listing of people in custody on immigration holds was a mistake due to technical glitches with his department’s system for publishing the jail roster.
“Most jails have policies in place where they don’t log people who might be in transport for various reasons,” Kopp said. “It’s a policy and practice that if we have inmates in transport, we historically, since I’ve been there, don’t tend to put them on the jail roster.”
Other sheriff departments in the state publicly list immigration holds, including in neighboring Sweetwater County and in Natrona County. (The Natrona County sheriff does not maintain a roster on his website, but sends news outlets a roster that some publish most days, and which includes ICE holds.) Officials with both agencies told WyoFile they publish ICE detainees in the public roster, largely regardless of how long they stay in those two jails.  
Wyoming law protects only narrow categories of offenders, like juveniles, from public disclosure — the names of the vast majority of people jailed in the state are public record. Sheriffs can set their own policies about what information to publicize online, Kopp said. When elected, he weighed whether to publish an inmate roster at all, given the stigma a jail stint can bring to residents of small communities like those in southwest Wyoming, he said.

On the other hand, withholding the names of immigrant detainees but publishing other inmates gives the public an inaccurate picture of who is passing through the jail in any given week, Chris Wages, a Buffalo attorney who does public records law work on behalf of the Wyoming Press Association, said in an interview. 
“The number and nature and identity of inmates traces directly back to fiscal responsibility,” he said. “As a private citizen, if my sheriff’s department was all of a sudden doubling their income, increasing their budget, I’d want to know why, under what circumstances, what the source of the revenue is, who’s making decisions, where the resources are being put, and how it affects my local population.”

(Getty Images)After a federal court decision rolled back a Wisconsin law that blocked disability payment recipients from collecting unemployment insurance, Democratic lawmakers have drafted legislation that repeals that law.
Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton)
“Our job is to correct mistakes or ensure that someone’s rights aren’t taken from them. And when this statute originally passed, I think that’s exactly what it did,” said Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) in a phone interview Tuesday after circulating the draft legislation earlier in the day.
“The good news is the court has come down and we now have the proper stance. Now, it’s our job to ensure that those rights aren’t infringed on again,” she said.
Dassler-Alfheim’s draft bill is co-authored by state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee). It codifies a ruling in July by U.S. District Judge William Conley that ordered the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to stop denying unemployment insurance applications from people who collect Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
Conley ruled a year ago that the 2013 Wisconsin law disqualifying Social Security Disability Insurance recipients from collecting unemployment insurance violated two federal laws: The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2021 opposing the state’s ban on jobless pay for people on SSDI.
Conley delayed imposing a remedy in his July 17, 2024, decision. While DWD never indicated plans to appeal the ruling, the department continued to enforce the 2013 law, blocking jobless pay for people on SSDI.
A year after his first decision, Conley ordered DWD to stop enforcing the law, and on Aug. 20, issued a follow-up order on behalf of two groups of people in the original lawsuit.
DWD must pay jobless benefits to applicants between Sept. 7, 2015 — when the SSDI-unemployment ban law was last revised — and July 30, 2025, who were denied because they received SSDI payments. Those applicants must demonstrate that they were eligible for unemployment insurance except for the SSDI ban, Conley wrote.
DWD must also pay back people who had originally been awarded jobless pay but were then required to return the money because they were on SSDI, the judge ordered.
Conley ruled that applicants are not eligible for state jobless pay for weeks in which they received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program that was created at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A first-term lawmaker, Dassler-Alfheim said her career in the insurance and financial industry attuned her to the issue that the SSDI ban on jobless pay raised.
“Being keenly aware when people have limitations on income is just something that I’ve always paid attention to,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “Anytime you’ve got restrictions on people . . . when they’re trying to work and something goes wrong, to not be able to give them the compensation — it’s just not right.”
The federal Social Security Administration program allows disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to, and encourages them to do so under programs that ensure they do not lose their disability payments or their medical coverage under Medicaid.
When Wisconsin banned SSDI recipients from unemployment pay, however, DWD under the administration of former Gov. Scott Walker discounted the possibility that people enrolled in the federal disability program might be able to work. A DWD proposal at the time asserted that disability payment recipients who applied for unemployment insurance were probably “double-dipping” and committing “fraud.”
The law was originally enacted in 2013, then amended in 2015, also during the Walker administration. 
The law “really was discrimination,” Dassler-Alfheim said Tuesday. “There’s no reason that that should have taken place.”
DWD proposal could blunt ruling’s impact
Waiting in the wings, however, is a proposal from the current DWD staff that critics say would undo the impact of Conley’s decision.
The proposal is part of the package that the department has submitted to the state Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council — a joint labor-management body that for decades has negotiated and recommended changes to the state’s jobless pay law. DWD presented its proposals — 12 in all — to the council in August.
The department’s proposal on unemployment pay for SSDI recipients calls for offsetting an applicant’s jobless pay by the applicant’s SSDI payment, “to prevent the payment of duplicative government benefits for the replacement of lost earnings or income, regardless of an individual’s ability to work.” 
The recipient’s monthly SSDI payment would be divided into fractions allocated for each week of jobless pay, and the equivalent amount of that payment would be subtracted from the recipient’s weekly unemployment check.
Victor Forberger
For many SSDI recipients that would wipe out their jobless pay entirely, according to unemployment insurance lawyer Victor Forberger. 
For example, a person who gets $1,000 from SSDI each month and is awarded unemployment pay would have $250 deducted each week from their unemployment benefits. 
“Very few SSDI recipients have a weekly unemployment insurance benefit of more than $250,” Forberger said in an interview in July — meaning that they would probably not collect any jobless pay at all despite qualifying for it. 
In a statement Tuesday, DWD defended the proposal.
The administration of Gov. Tony Evers has three times proposed budgets that would end the ban on UI for SSDI recipients on the grounds that “denying unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to social security disability insurance (SSDI) recipients was discriminatory,” DWD’s statement said.
Those same proposals included offset provisions. DWD said that those proposals “mirrored the treatment [of] SSDI with the treatment of pensions and lump sum payments under UI law.” Those payments can similarly reduce an unemployment insurance award. 
Lawmakers on the state Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee threw all those changes out of the budget each time, however. 
Conley’s July 2024 opinion found barring jobless pay for SSDI recipients violated federal law, the DWD statement said. But, the department statement added, his ruling also “noted that offsets to the receipt of SSDI have been upheld by other courts.” 
Conley’s most recent orders blocked DWD from enforcing the SSDI unemployment insurance ban, “but did not order an offset,” said the DWD statement, calling the judge’s order “consistent with DWD’s policy position.”
“DWD has already begun processing payments for individuals who receive SSDI,” the statement said. “DWD will continue [to] meet the requirements of the court’s order and any legislation that is signed into law.”
Forberger said reducing jobless pay by the amount of a recipient’s SSDI payment would effectively nullify the court’s ruling, however. “It would perpetuate the discrimination,” he said. 
SSDI benefits are “a bare minimum and in some cases not even that,” Forberger said. People enrolled in SSDI and who also take jobs “need to do this work to support themselves.”
Dassler-Alfheim told the Wisconsin Examiner that she would oppose including the offset proposal in a UI revision bill. 
“If they lose that job that they have gone out of their way to get, even though they’re disabled, they certainly deserve to be compensated for their unemployment at the same rate, under the same scruples, as anybody else,” Dassler-Alfheim said.
“These are people that are doing exactly what society wants them to do — not sitting home on a disability check,” she added. “Why would we disincentivize by removing benefits if they were to lose their job for something they didn’t do?”

On a nexus of public land in western Wyoming, red rock spires and striped hoodoos delight visitors. Just bring water and a hat.
The post Dubois has its own badlands. Here’s how to explore them. appeared first on WyoFile .","Drive two and a half hours southeast of Yellowstone National Park and you’ll find a different kind of wild. Wind blows sand across dry stream beds, and gnarled, candy-striped hoodoos jut out of reef-like rocks. You’re not on Mars — you’re in the heart of Wyoming in the Dubois Badlands.
The Dubois Badlands are not a remote, difficult-to-find wilderness, but they’re just far enough from the beaten path to feel like it. Located on the north side of U.S. Highway 26 near the small town of Dubois, the badlands are an ecologically unique part of the Equality State with opportunities for recreation and contemplation.
One of the most popular ways to explore the badlands is on foot. After turning off the highway to the main entrance on Kingfisher Road, visitors may park and enter through a chain-link gate. Dusty footpaths wind for miles: first through Wyoming State Trust Land, then land owned by the Bureau of Land Management. There are no marked trails, though visitors may follow the Dubois Badlands Trail found on the AllTrails app. This route offers views of the red rock spires and buttes that make the badlands unique. Visitors should be warned that there is no shade in the easily accessible parts of the badlands, making a hat and water must-brings for an adventure here.
Wildlife lovers visiting the area will find much to appreciate. The greater short-horned lizard, better known as the horny toad — Wyoming’s state reptile — can be seen hurrying alongside hiking trails. Eagle-eyed searchers may also find members of the Whiskey Mountain bighorn sheep herd. Other Wyoming megafauna like elk, black bear and pronghorn may be found in the badlands, too.

The distinction between Wyoming State Trust and BLM land in the Dubois Badlands is important. Wyoming State Trust lands are managed by the state government to maximize profitability for the state’s K-12 education. While management varies from place to place, the WST lands in the Dubois Badlands allow recreation like hiking, horseback riding and motorized vehicle use. Camping, however, is not permitted.
The State Trust land is mostly flat, with some small hills running through sagebrush and barrel cacti. Late spring and early summer see wildflowers bloom through the basin, and water may rush down the wide stream bed that descends from the crags and buttes of the BLM area.
Situated behind the State Trust land are 4,250 acres owned by the BLM. The land is designated a Wilderness Study Area, which means it is managed as if it has a congressional wilderness designation. A wilderness designation ensures the primitive character of a landscape remains intact. Visitors to the area may hike, ride, hunt or fish, but mechanical items like mountain bikes or side-by-sides may not be used there. Visitors to the area may camp in the BLM land.
Deeper into the badlands, the BLM land is geologically fascinating. Visitors may get closer to the red, white, and orange stripes that feature prominently on the area’s rock walls. Adventurous souls may attempt to visit the gray spires of Joe Back’s Throne, a soaring cirque named for a local artist and outfitter.

The BLM does not advertise the space as particularly user-friendly. “Day hiking would be possible, but the WSA’s size and lack of water limits its attraction for extended backpacking,” the BLM’s webpage states. Challenges aside, “the area’s relatively unique geology and its scenery are major attractions.”
The Friends of the Dubois Badlands is a local nonprofit dedicated to preserving and protecting the area with the Wilderness Study Area designation. The group of local artists, scientists, sportspeople and more “want people to appreciate how beautiful this is but also want them to know what to do/not do in order to protect this marvelous gift.”
The group holds regular events that promote engagement with the badlands, including lectures on ecology and guided hikes, and collaborates with government agencies. In 2024, the Friends and the Wyoming State Lands office cleaned up an illegal garbage dump, while in 2022, the group teamed with the Lander BLM office to pull over a mile of unneeded barbed wire from the Wilderness Study Area.
Though not very well-known, the Dubois Badlands offer an excellent, quiet place for Wyoming locals and tourists alike to visit. As the weather cools, visit this unique area for hiking, wildlife viewing and to experience another side of wild Wyoming.

(Getty Images)Idaho officials may look to tap a new rural hospital fund created in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed by Congress to increase medical training in the state. 
The Idaho Medical Education Working Group — made up of legislators and medical field stakeholders — is looking to craft legislative recommendations to enhance medical education in the state and address its significant physician shortage, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. At the group’s meeting Monday, members discussed potentially leveraging a new tool, created by the massive federal tax and spending law, to improve opportunities for graduate medical education in rural health centers. 
Those rural health systems and other small ones may also be facing more significant challenges due to the major spending reductions in Medicaid that was also included in the law. 
Dr. Ted Epperly, president and CEO of Full Circle Health and a work group member, said his organization will be one of many that will be affected. 
“Forty percent of our patients are Medicaid patients,” Epperly said Monday. “With the cuts that are designed to come to Medicaid, it’s going to have a significant impact on our revenue streams.” 
 The Big Beautiful Bill’s effect on Idaho’s medical education is unclear and mixed

Over the next decade, the bill is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, the Sun reported. The reductions will come from a combination of new policies, including work requirements for some participants, increased requirements to check and renew eligibility, and removing from the rolls participants who aren’t citizens or don’t have a green card. 
“The impacts and funding streams and health care now are absolutely up in the air,” Epperly said regarding the federal changes.

He said more uninsured patients mean that some hospitals will have to try and figure out ways to make up costs to treat those patients. 
The working group on Monday focused on increasing the number of graduate residency programs, which doctors who graduate medical school must complete to practice medicine, to help recruit and retain more doctors in Idaho. However, hosting a residency is expensive and time consuming, speakers said at the meeting, and it’s difficult for rural hospitals to do so. 
Epperly said training a graduate resident costs about $210,000 per resident per year, because “it takes a lot of people to train a resident.” When the state of Idaho developed a plan in 2017 to increase the number of residencies in Idaho, it was estimated to cost about $180,000 per resident per year — a cost that is shared among the state, the program doing the training and the sponsoring institution. 
“The challenge is going to be the funding mechanism,” said Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association. “And when most of our rural hospitals are operating at either a 1% or less margin, it’s difficult to find the funding within that current structure.” 
Whitlock and Epperly identified upcoming funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program, created in the tax and spending bill, as an opportunity to grow residencies in rural Idaho. The fund will establish $50 billion that can go to states over the next five years; half of the funding will go out to each state in equal distributions and half will be available to apply for and will be allocated based on factors such as rural population, the proportion of rural health facilities in the state, and the situation of certain hospitals in the state, according to the website for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. 
Workforce development is one of the strategic goals of the rural hospital fund, the website said. The public can submit input to shape Idaho’s application to the Rural Health Transformation Program online through a survey until Sept. 30.
Around 58% of medical residents who train in Idaho stay in the state, according to Epperly’s presentation, which places Idaho’s retention as seventh highest in the U.S. 
He told other work group members that the Rural Health Transformation Program “ought to be a mechanism by which we could put our heads together in the state of Idaho and figure out how potentially we could tap that money to help both rural hospitals and rural health systems develop GME (graduate medical education).” 
Whitlock, head of the Idaho Hospital Association, said in the prior two weeks he traveled to hospitals across the state and leaders all asked about the new rural health fund. 
“As we talk to every one of our hospitals, the No. 1 concern that they have moving forward for the next five years is how to recruit and retain physicians in this state,” Whitlock said. “The second is, how do we find the space and the ability to train and teach students?”
With Idaho’s rapid population growth, he said, infrastructure improvements and increased space to practice and teach should be considered for these funds. 
 Idaho U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo: ‘rural hospitals are in serious trouble today’ 

As chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, was a key figure in crafting much of the final version of the tax and spending bill, including the rural health fund. 
He told the Sun in an August interview that he thought the concerns about Medicaid reductions in the law were “overstated, but the concerns about rural hospitals are not overstated.”

“Rural hospitals are in serious trouble today, and nothing in the One Big Beautiful Bill on Medicaid will go into effect until 2028,” Crapo said. 
He said that lawmakers opted to distribute half the funding equally to avoid concerns over a formula that may give larger sums to more populous states. 
“And that was a political negotiation to help every state feel like no matter how this fund got distributed, they were going to get at least a fair share,” Crapo said. 
The law didn’t create criteria for how the rest of the funds should be distributed, largely giving discretion to CMS. 
He said that often the problem in rural Idaho hospitals stems from too few patients leading to low revenues. 
“But these are unique circumstances in every rural part of the country,” Crapo said, “and each one is slightly different, but there are different reasons for each and one of the reasons we give this money to the states is so that they can fine tune how it is utilized in those regions and for those hospitals that are really facing the trouble.” 
CMS is expected to provide states guidance for applying to grant money next week, Whitlock said, and it is expected applications will be due by November. Approval will be provided by Dec. 31.

Miller's mythical cowboys have a little fun translating Wyoming ranch listings.
The post Real estate porn around the ol’ campfire appeared first on WyoFile .","Days are getting shorter, and nightfall comes sooner in the old cow camp this time of year. Bone-weary drovers sit around the ol’ campfire after a tough day on the trail. The desultory conversation seems to wander, until Sweetwater Slim pipes up and says, “Saaay, didja hear that the Slash V outfit just got sold? Some bitcoin zillionaire paid 40 million bucks fer that sorry piece o’ country.”

Opinion

“Hell’s bells!” interjected Sourdough. “Them poor Slash V cows spend their lives at a trot, goin’ from one blade o’ grass t’other, tryin’ to stay alive. Forty million bucks?”
“There’s a lotta that new money floatin’ around,” offered Slim, “an’ a lotta city fellers wantin’ to be John Wayne an’ own a Yellowstone o’ their own. They’s just a’slobberin’ over any ranch that comes on the market.”
“An’ there’s a passel o’ them ol’ cow outfits hittin’ the market these days fer serious money.” This from Panhandle, who pulled a dog-eared Sotheby’s catalog from his chap pocket. He brought a coal-oil lamp to the fire and displayed the glossy brochure. “Lookee here, pards,” he said. “There’s a couple dozen o’ them ol’ ranches right here in the Big Empty fer sale.” He opened the thick Sotheby’s catalog to the fold-out scratch-n-sniff centerfold and passed it around to his amigos.
Murmurs of “oooh” and “ahhhh” were heard from the campfire smoke, as the cowboys thumbed through the old Wyoming ranches offered for sale in amounts up to nine figures. They’d worked these outfits, knew them well and were taken aback by the prices and the carefully airbrushed photos and florid prose that described these places.
“Lemme see that.” Cookie grabbed the catalog and turned a few pages. “My nephew works for one o’ them big brokers in Jackson Hole, and he writes this stuff purely to sell ranches to city dudes. He says iff’n ya cain’t sell profit potential, ya gotta sell the purty.” Stetsons nodded at this wisdom. “An’ he says ya gotta invent a new language to do it, he calls it real estate porn. It’s like a code.”
Puzzled glances met Cookie’s words.
Cookie tossed the catalog to Goshen Gus and said, “Read me somethin’ from one o’ them ads, an’ I’ll translate it for ya.”

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Gus squinted, ran his finger down a page and read, “Enjoy unparalleled solitude and privacy on your own little slice of western heaven.”
Cookie thought a moment, then said, “First off, ‘little slice’ means it ain’t no bigger’n a wrangle pasture. An’ the rest of it means yer livin’ thirty miles from town down a washed out road, and ya cain’t get off the place in the winter.”
Gus handed the glossy catalog to Deacon from Dayton, who read, “well-watered with sub-irrigated meadows.”
“That un’ easy,” exclaimed Cookie. “What they’re really sayin’ is that the mosquitoes an’ deerflies’ll suck you dry o’ blood iff’n you step outside the house in summer.”
Little Joe the Wrangler read over Deacon’s shoulder and said, “How ‘bout this, ‘An uninterrupted, 360-degree view of wild Wyoming splendor.”
Cookie interpreted, “That place is somewhere in the Red Desert, an’ their ain’t a tree tall enough to block yer view of all them rattlesnakes an’ sagebrush. That there’s a good example o’ fine real estate porn.”
Houlihan grabbed the brochure and read, “a stone’s throw from world-class, blue ribbon trout fishing.”
Cookie waved his greasy cook spoon and said, “That’s real estate porn fer ‘the river is on yer neighbor’s land, an’ he’ll shoot ya iff’n ya try to wet a line.’ See how this works?”
“Ok, Cookie. Iff’n yer so smart, what does this mean?” Powder River Pete taunted, then read, “Room for a man of the West to stretch his legs and get a good, old-fashioned feel for the countryside.”
“Think about it,” Cookie replied. “That means no indoor plumbin’ an’ the outhouse is a quarter mile away from the cabin. Next.”
The Sotheby’s catalog was back in Panhandle’s grip now, and he read, “Thousand-year-old petroglyphs stand guard along your clear mountain creek, speaking ancient native wisdom to those who listen.”
Cookie regarded Panhandle and said, “Pard, you an’ I have worked that ranch, an’ we know what those petroglyphs along Difficulty Creek are sayin’. They say ‘This water will give you the runs. Don’t drink it.”
Panhandle closed the brochure, the campfire light sputtered and Cookie said, “Speakin’ o’ runs, who’s ready fer some beans?”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Assembly Republicans announced a broad education agenda Tuesday along with a set of task forces. The slate of proposals they plan to advance this fall includes one to encourage school district consolidation and one to push Gov. Tony Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, though exact bill details were scant. Among the new task forces is one that pursues goals similar to those of a Republican committee established this year to improve government efficiency.
As Wisconsin lawmakers return from their summer break, they are beginning to roll out their goals for the rest of the legislative session through early 2026. Democratic lawmakers have also been rolling out  bills, including a package to cancel Walker-era labor laws and one that would reauthorize the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rocherster) knocked Democrats’ proposals at the press conference Tuesday. 
“I’ve been watching over the course of the past several weeks as my Democratic colleagues have been talking about what they would like to accomplish this fall and the vast majority of things they’ll be introducing are repealing some good things that we have done,” Vos said. “They are not really focusing on the future. They are continuing to obsess about the past and the good work that we have done. Unlike where our Democratic colleagues are, we’re really looking at the issues that are important to the entire state of Wisconsin.” 
Republicans’ education proposals seek to address a number of issues.
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said new GOP legislation seeks to help address financial issues school districts are facing by encouraging them to look at consolidating and sharing services. 
Currently, there are 421 public school districts across the state. Nedweski said that given declining enrollment, that number may need to be cut. 
“We have lost 53,000 students over the last decade,” Nedweski said, “Because student enrollment is the primary driver of our state’s school funding formula, districts experiencing declining enrollment receive less money in state aid.” 
As state support for education has declined, Wisconsin school districts have increasingly had to go to referendum to ask for additional funding from local property taxpayers. Public school advocates blame record-breaking  referendum drives on state funding not keeping pace with inflation. During the most recent state budget, Democrats and advocates called for additional per pupil funding for public schools, but Republicans rejected it and provided no increase to schools’ general state aid.
“Democrats might argue that the solution is something to throw more money at the problem, but it does not solve the issue that there are just less kids being born today than there were 20 years ago,” Nedweski said. “It’s a birth rate issue as enrollment continues to decline, especially in smaller rural districts. Many schools will face difficult decisions, and our goal is to provide support and give tools, remove barriers, and create incentives for voluntary consolidation.”
Nedweski argued that consolidation would help address the “cycle of referendum.” 
She pointed to her own district as an example, saying she has seven single-school K-8 school districts and two school districts that are high schools. 
“That’s a lot of administrative costs and a lot of redundant services and money being spent that couldn’t be going to teachers and into the classroom, so many of them have gone to referendum over the last couple of years, some have been successful, some have failed,” Nedweski said. “We’re seeing a failure rate increase and consolidation cases like these could lower overhead, reduce costs and allow schools to serve students more efficiently and more effectively.” 
She said the specifics of the financial incentives are still being worked out, but will include providing state funds to help consolidating districts equalize their mill rates if they vary, a grant program for school districts exploring consolidation and potentially a policy related to “grade sharing,” among two or more school districts. 
“We are still sort of polishing up some of this policy that we really have taken input from people all around the state from administrators, even educators,” Nedweski said. 
A bill from Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) will instruct Evers to opt into a new federal school choice tax credit program. 
A provision in the federal law signed by Trump in July and that goes into effect in 2027, will provide a dollar-to-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support taxpayer-financed private-school vouchers. Governors have until Jan. 1, 2027 to opt into the program.
“This program isn’t about one educational school,” Rodriguez said. “Instead, it helps public, private, charter and even homeschool families access the tools they need to help their kids succeed.”
Rodriguez noted that the scholarships can be used for tutoring, transportation costs, supplemental courses and other costs. 
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Evers has already said he will not opt Wisconsin into the program. If the bill were passed by the Senate and Assembly instructing Evers to take action, he could veto the legislation. 
Rodriguez called on Evers to reconsider.
“He claims that opting our state in would be ‘catastrophic’ to public schools, but the federal tax credit can benefit students in private and public schools alike,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “Having Wisconsin join this federal program should be a slam dunk!… This is a chance to bring more resources into our classrooms — public, private, rural and urban — to help our children succeed.”
Teachers Bill of Rights and other bills
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) is authoring a bill that would implement a “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” that he said would seek to ensure teachers have recourses when  students exhibit disruptive or violent behavior. The language of the bill isn’t yet available.
“Every teacher needs to be safe in his or her classroom, so there needs to be a policy in place,” Penterman said. “What is the recourse if I, as a teacher, send a student away for some sort of violent, disruptive behavior? Teachers and administration need to be on the exact same page. We’re still finalizing some of the details, so I look forward to sharing the final bill with you when it comes out.” 
Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) said lawmakers will try to help address disparities in math performance by passing legislation similar to a new reading instruction law, but for math. He said the bill will seek to implement screeners to help catch students who are struggling early and put them on an individualized plan to help catch them up. 
“This bill is not going to be the full solution to the problem, but I think it’s a very good first step,” Kitchens said.
Kitchens said he also plans to introduce a bill to ban drones from flying over schools without written permission from school administrators following some complaints from constituents.  
“This is both a safety and a privacy issue,” Kitchens said. 
Another bill from Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Greenville) seeks to make it easier for students to participate in college dual enrollment courses. 
Vos said the bills do not negate Wisconsin’s local control policies for school districts. 
“We always stood strongly in favor of that, but there are some statewide standards,” Vos said. “As an example, if you look at protecting teachers, I think that’s very easy for us to say. It doesn’t matter if you teach in Milwaukee or Burlington, River Falls or Rice Lake, you should have the same protections to ensure that if a disruptive student happens at your school where it’s taking its division and that they’re standing behind you.”
Vos said that the goal of his caucus is to release bill drafts over the next two weeks, then move them through the public hearing process in time to be considered during an October floor session. 
The bills would also need to advance in the Senate.
“We are the ones who work a little bit faster in the Assembly, but an awful lot of things become  law because of our partnership with the state Senate…  I am extremely confident by February, when we adjourn, we will have produced a good package of bills we can all stand behind,” Vos said. 
Speakers’ task forces 
The lawmakers also announced the creation of four bipartisan task forces by Vos, including one focused on protecting children online, one seeking to make state government more efficient using artificial intelligence, one to better elder services and one that will explore how to rework the state’s rulemaking process after a recent state Supreme Court ruling took away some of lawmakers’ power to block rules. 
The task forces will meet this fall with the goal of wrapping up their work by the end of the year.
The rulemaking task force will be chaired by Rep. Brent Jacobson (R-Mosinee). He said the task force will seek to identify agencies with broad rulemaking powers that may be “better left to the Legislature,” to strengthen standing committee review of rules and to write a constitutional amendment proposal that will reimplement the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR). 
Jacobson said the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s Evers v. Marklein II decision in July — which found that state laws giving JCRAR broad powers to block administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional — was a “180-turn” on the rulemaking process. 
The Evers administration has  taken steps after the ruling to implement rules without the approval of legislative committees. Republican lawmakers have, in turn, tried to block the implementation of the rules, including a committee last week calling on the Evers administration to drop a proposed rule language change that would replace the phrases “mother” and “woman” with “member” and “father” with “other parent.”
Jacobson made an appeal to Democrats, noting the Evers will not be in office come 2027. 
“There could be a Republican in the governor’s office after next year’s election, and this topic could be one of Democrats’ top priorities next session,” Jacobson said. “With an open governor’s race, we have an opportunity for a bipartisan revamp of the way we hold bureaucrats accountable in Wisconsin.” 
Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston) will chair a task force dedicated to looking at elder services. Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) will chair a task force on “protecting kids.”
“We face a rising youth mental health crisis in our state. We recognize that social media and unrestricted access to the internet has opened a deep chasm into our family structure and filled it with mindless or even dangerous content,” Brill said. “As so many forces try to rip families apart and divide them from each other, we have an obligation to work diligently to keep families together, connected, informed and strong.”
Rep. Jim Piwowarczyk (R – Hubertus) will chair a task force on government efficiency and modernization. It is different from, though related to, a committee formed in the last legislative session that mirrored the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Wisconsin’s version is called the Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency Committee (GOAT). 
The Speaker’s Task Force on Government Efficiency and Modernization will specifically look at ways to replace outdated processes with modern tools, reduce administrative overhead through automation, integrate systems and use data to predict demand and allocate resources more effectively. 
The GOAT Committee also has a goal of working to eliminate government inefficiency.

Idaho is planning to apply to the Rural Health Transformation Fund, a $50 billion five-year fund created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed into law this year by congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, has said the state could receive $100 million each year from the fund over its five years, calling it “arguably the single largest investment in rural health care in more than 20 years.”
He pushed for several aspects of the bill, which also deeply cuts spending for public assistance programs, including Medicaid. 
The public can submit input to shape Idaho’s application online through a survey until Sept. 30 at https://app.keysurvey.com/f/41795757/170f/.
“Input from rural health care providers, hospitals, clinics, community organizations, payers, workforce entities, universities, tribal nations, associations, local governments, and the public is critical to guiding the department’s application for funding and how this funding may be best used to serve rural Idaho communities,” Health and Welfare officials said in a news release. 
Survey responses are a public record, and officials suggest people don’t submit sensitive or confidential information.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Nashville’s Republican state senator says his initial concerns about the “Music City Loop” have been resolved, to the point he already wants to expand the proposed tunnel’s route to locations such as the East Bank and Music City Star depot in the Donelson area.
Sen. Mark Pody, a Lebanon Republican whose district takes in eastern Davidson County and Nashville International Airport, said he met with state agencies and Elon Musk’s Boring Company, which satisfied all of his questions as it prepares to dig a tunnel from downtown Nashville, just off Rosa Parks Boulevard near the Capitol, to the airport under Murfreesboro Road for a private transport operation. 
“I’m fully on board with it, and I feel very comfortable with it, and think this is going to be a good thing for Tennessee,” Pody said.
Vice chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, Pody said he wants to make sure the proposed tunnel doesn’t cause environmental or utility problems, but he’s also interested in Boring directing it to the Hermitage/Donelson area where parking is available for the Music City Star, a train that runs into downtown Nashville. He would like to see it extend, as well, to the East Bank where the state is involved with Metro Nashville in a massive development of the Titans stadium, Tennessee Performing Arts Center, Oracle headquarters and housing.
Besides responding to Pody, the Boring Company answered some 70 questions by Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office, saying it would obtain Metro and state permits for the underground project and use backup emergency services measures for safety.

The loop, costing a few hundred million dollars in private funding, would use parallel tunnels to all locations so vehicles could travel in each direction, according to the responses. Any fees the company would pay to the state or Metro remain under negotiations.
The mayor’s office is reviewing the responses and expects to follow up with the Boring Company to get a better understanding of the potential impact on Nashville residents, according to spokesperson Julie Oaks Smith.
Despite the company’s assurances and Pody’s acceptance, Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville continues to oppose the plan, calling the process “outrageous” and saying no impact study has been completed in advance of the work.
Regardless of whether the project turns out to be good for the area, the state hasn’t considered the views of Nashville residents, she said. 
The State Building Commission Executive Subcommittee held a public hearing more than a month ago, taking comments from the public, but held little discussion before approving a no-cost lease of a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol for Boring to launch its tunnel-digging equipment.
“It’s indicative of a larger trend nationally with the government we’re seeing that disregards the democratic process, and that to me is one of the most alarming parts of it,” Campbell said.
The project also provides one more example of the state government favoring large corporations over public interests, Campbell said.
The state of Tennessee plans to sign a long-term lease with Boring for occupancy and operations on state right of way that would go through the state’s excess land process, which requires approval by the Federal Highway Administration, according to Department of Transportation spokesperson Beth Emmons.
The Boring Company has announced its plan to apply for a permit with the Department of Transportation, which has to be reviewed to determine whether the permit is applicable, Emmons said. The state tailors permits based on each project.
Nashville mayor’s office queries Boring Company about tunnel plan

“This being a first-of-its-kind project, we expect this request would result in an enhanced grading permit to address the large scope of work and that may require additional information and requirements of the permittee to ensure all state interests are maintained throughout construction,” Emmons said.
Responding to Metro
The Boring Company last week sent O’Connell’s office responses to a multitude of questions.

For emergency vehicle access during and after construction, Nashville tunnels will be designed to meet national transit standards that require exit spacing up to 2,500 feet. Emergency vehicles would access the same portals as Tesla vehicles used in the loop.
Music City Loop would comply with authorities that have jurisdiction over life safety. The company met with the State Fire Marshal’s Office and Nashville Fire Department and invited them to visit the Vegas Loop to see life safety systems at work.
Tunnels would have “redundant” communication systems for 911 calls and responders, enabling coordination between emergency services workers and dispatchers above ground, all meeting national requirements. Passengers and responders could make 911 calls four ways: at blue light stations, directly from cell phones, through vehicles or by an operations control center.
Tunnels will have space for passengers and employees to get in and out of vehicles in an emergency. Vegas Loop tunnels have nearly 3 feet between the vehicle’s side mirror and wall.
In case of a vehicle battery fire — Tesla reports 232 confirmed battery fires — a ventilation system will send smoke and hazardous gases toward outlets.
To keep people out of the tunnel, access points would have secure gates, controlled station entrances and camera coverage without blind spots. In case a person entered without permission, an operations control center or automated systems would alert security and trigger a red tunnel light prompting drivers to stop until the person is removed.
Similarly to the Vegas Loop, Music City Loop tunnels would be watertight using gaskets to seal joints and a 3-inch layer of grout sealant outside the tunnel. If water gets into the system, high-power sump pumps would force it out.
Music City Loop insurance would meet and exceed requirements specified in permits and state law, and the company would be responsible for injuries caused by its operations.
Long-term ownership of the tunnel is being reviewed and is to be released to the public when final.
Maintenance and upkeep is to be privately funded and subject to terms of the state lease agreement.
The project is undergoing utility review to avoid conflicts. Music City Loop will pay for relocating utilities and adhere to permitting processes.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) On Wednesday, The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced an additional $1.5 million investment into Virginia’s state elections this year. 
While the organization typically supports legislative candidates in states around the country, this year it is also boosting Virginia lieutenant governor candidate Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield. Lieutenant governors preside over the state Senate and become an extension of the legislature when they need to cast tie-breaking votes. 
Hashmi expressed gratitude in a statement to The Mercury for DLCC’s work to “support Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.” 
The new cash infusion is part of DLCC’s ongoing seven-figure investment in Virginia to help protect or expand Democrats’ majority. This year, all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are up for election, with Democrats running in every district.
Democrats reach historic goal: A full slate in Virginia House races

Over past two decades, Virginia has typically elected a governor from the opposite party that won the White House the year before, with those gains trickling into legislative races and even local contests. This track record gives Democrats an edge this year, but Republicans hope to break the cycle. 
A handful of seats are typically deemed most competitive each year; this time, DLCC is also spotlighting other district seats that pundits suspect could be flippable for the party. 
House District 64 Democratic nominee Stacey Carroll, is running for such a seat and is included in the latest round of candidate spotlights from DLCC.  The district, currently represented by Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, leans Republican. In last year’s presidential election, that margin was under 2 points, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. 
Carroll said she’s not focused on partisanship when she’s door-knocking.
“I talk to people about government,” she said. “Not about a specific party, but specific policies and how those would impact people.”
She’s interested in low-propensity voters — people who might be motivated to cast their ballot because of certain policies, rather than an “R” or “D” behind the candidates’ name.
Carroll and Milde’s district, and others in Northern Virginia, have been home to a sizable population of federal workers. Thousands around the state having been laid off this year by President Donald Trump’s administration. It’s one issue Carroll has encountered while campaigning.
“As I’m on the doors, one of the sentiments that I hear through and through is that government is just not working for the average American and a resident of here,” Carroll said.
As she courts voters in an area that has often had a Republican lean, funding boosts from national groups can help her campaign, and others’.
While DLCC has always supported state legislature contests, the Democratic National Committee announced efforts this spring to further bolster state parties’ organizing. The focus on state-level gains is important for the party’s national apparatus and candidate pipelines, DNC chair Ken Martin emphasized on a press call in April. 
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” he said. 
Retaining or growing Democratic majorities is also paramount to advancing three constitutional amendments that have mostly fallen on party lines. 
One measure would automatically restore voting rights for ex-felons who have completed their sentences, and another would enshrine same-sex marriage protections should fedreal protections end. Both measures received bipartisan support, albeit primarily from Democrats. 
The third amendment would enshrine reproductive rights into the state constitution, which every Republican has voted against. 
All three measures must pass again in 2026 before they could end up on ballots for voters statewide to approve or reject. 
“These elections couldn’t be more important, which is why the DLCC is all hands on deck to fuel these winning campaigns through Election Day,” DLCC president Heather Williams said in a statement. 
Williams will be in Richmond this coming Saturday for an in-person meet-and-greet with candidates in competitive districts in Central Virginia. 
Countering DLCC, the Republican State Leadership Committee announced a $2 million investment in canvassing efforts for Virginia and New Jersey elections this summer and funded targeted advertisements earlier this year.

(Photo: Getty Images)Rarely do we think about who owns the local television stations licensed to serve our communities, but a recent proposed merger of two big TV owners would have huge implications for Tennessee and the rest of the nation. The plan also demonstrates the folly of excessive deregulation allowing for the growth of media behemoths.
When you watch CBS programming on WREG in Memphis, you are not watching a CBS-owned station. That station is owned by Nexstar, a huge media player that currently owns or operates more than 200 television stations, reaching more than 212 million people across 116 markets. Nexstar simply has a business deal to carry CBS programs into the Memphis market — by its transmitter tower using the public airwaves, or indirectly by others bringing it into your home by satellite, fiber optic cable or wireless distribution.
The ABC affiliate in Memphis (WATN) and the NBC affiliate in Knoxville (WBIR) both are owned and operated by Tegna, a chain of 64 stations in 51 U. S. markets, spun off from Gannett in 2015. Nexstar now has declared it wants to buy out Tegna. That would put the two previously mentioned Memphis stations under the same ownership; it would do the same in Knoxville with WBIR and ABC affiliate WATE.
This level of concentration almost by definition will harm the competitiveness of the local TV advertising market and public service. When newsrooms merge or disappear, we as audience members lose because there are fewer reporters and producers suggesting, researching, and presenting news accounts of local events in Memphis, Knoxville, and in many other spots around the nation.
Scott Barker of Knoxville’s online news site Compass also pointed out the harm to local broadcast employees. He wrote, “[T]he prospect of becoming Nexstar employees may not fill WBIR staff with glee. The company is notorious in the industry for low wages.”
A recent report from the National Association of Broadcast Employees & Technicians found that the “majority (62%) of Nexstar workers earn less than a living wage for their metro area for a single person without children and 89% earn less than a living wage for their metro area for a single person with one child.”
The same report declared that “Nexstar pays 22% less than the median wage, on average, for the most common occupations surveyed. Workers report that they have to skip breaks and often work in understaffed departments. Meanwhile, Nexstar is very profitable and seeks to grow through more acquisitions of local broadcast stations.”
To make its acquisitions possible, Nexstar wants to waive or eliminate the few remaining Federal Communications Commission rules limiting concentration of ownership. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals this past summer threw out one FCC rule blocking one owner from acquiring two of the top four stations in any market. The FCC still has a rule that caps a single broadcast owner from controlling stations whose combined signals reach more than 39% of the U.S. population. The FCC, however, is in the middle of administrative procedures to wipe out that limit, effectively doing the bidding of Nexstar whose $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna would leave the combined company reaching 80% of U.S. households.
Another cautionary Tennessee story about concentrated ownership also can be demonstrated through Sinclair Broadcast Group. It owns Fox affiliate WZTV in Nashville, plus both WRCB (NBC) and WTVC (ABC/Fox) in Chattanooga. It also owns WCYB (NBC) in the Tri-Cities market (Johnson City, Kingsport, Bristol) and operates the Fox affiliate there for another company.
Sinclair is a very large owner/operator of TV licenses in the U.S. The latest tally is 185 stations in 85 markets. Most local TV news is remarkably apolitical. Station ownership is more interested in the green of profitability than red v. blue political disputes. Sinclair, however, is a big player in extreme right-wing politics.
During the 2016 campaign, Sinclair, in a deal trumpeted by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, ordered its stations to run more favorable stories about then-candidate Donald Trump. Sinclair went through a period of “must-run” commentaries from Trump operative Boris Epshteyn. Sinclair also insists its newsrooms air material on conspiracies like the “deep state”’ and voice warnings about “fake news.” More recently, Nexstar has mandated its stations run stories pushing broadcast deregulation.
Sinclair’s duplicity was exposed dramatically in 2018 when Deadspin put together a video of dozens of Sinclair anchors reading word-for-word a required commentary slamming other news outlets for pushing personal bias.
Broadcast station owners for years have crusaded against nearly all regulation. They note that no such regulation exists for newspapers, magazines, online forums or sites. Anyone can start a news web site and many of us would be repulsed at the First Amendment complications of restricting who could. TV stations, however, have made billions over decades using a limited scarce public resource, public airwaves. It isn’t too much to insist that they owe some minimal obligations to those of us without access to such airwaves. That can include technical standards for signal strength, but also some ownership limits so this valuable public resource is not swallowed up by a handful of operators. The cheapness of Nexstar and the partisanship of Sinclair only serve to highlight the obvious dangers.
Tennesseans with concerns can call or write the FCC to comment about the FCC keeping its limits on the percentage of U.S. audience any one station owner may reach.  It’s a matter that stretches from Memphis to Knoxville in terms of constricting the number of voices operating television stations.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The amount of money Louisiana state government spent on information technology products and services increased dramatically over three budget cycles, from July 2021 to June 2024. 

Louisiana state agencies went from spending $554.4 million with the Office of Technology Services in fiscal year 2022 to spending $652.5 million in fiscal year 2024, according to a report the Louisiana Legislative Auditor released this week. That’s an increase of $98 million (18%) over three years. 

Five state agencies that saw the largest surge in spending on IT services:

Louisiana Department of Health, $34.2 million (24.5%) 
Department of Children and FamilServices, $14.5 million (15.9%)
Secretary of State, $1.5 million (55%)
Department of Corrections, $7.7 increase (47%) 
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, $3 million (41%)

Some of the agencies with large increases went through well publicized technology upgrades. 
The Department of Children and Family Services, which went from spending $91.4 million in fiscal year 2022 to $105.9 million in fiscal year 2024, has started to upgrade its system so its records can be digitized and its operations can be improved. The Department of Corrections and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries have made similar change. 

The Secretary of State attributes its increase in IT expenses – which went from $2.7 million in fiscal year 2022 to $4.2 million in fiscal year 2024 – to printing and mailing letters to voters about the new congressional and Louisiana Supreme Court districts in 2024. The effort was handled, in part, by the state Office of Technology Services. 

The Department of Health attributed the hike in its technology budget – which went from $139.6 million in fiscal year 2022 to $173.8 million in fiscal year 2024 – to the culling of the Medicaid rolls following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
State officials said existing technology had to be updated in order to drop people from Medicaid enrollment who were no longer entitled to the coverage following the end of the COVID-19 emergency. The federal government required people who were at risk of being removed from the program to be contacted in several different manners, which was also handled by the Office of Technology Services.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-10 06:56:37.050808

(Photo courtesy of NDSU)Representatives of North Dakota’s two largest universities say Trump administration efforts to curb federal spending have already cost the state millions in research funding — and their institutions expect to lose millions more in the coming years.
The executive branch is attempting to slash research spending by terminating existing  grants and appropriating less money for research in the upcoming budget.
Scott Snyder, the University of North Dakota’s vice president for research, told a legislative committee on Aug. 21 that the Trump budget proposal cuts research funding from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation by 50%.
“Big time cuts,” Snyder said. 
Snyder and Heidi Grunwald, interim vice president for research at North Dakota State University, pointed to an Aug. 7 executive order from President Donald Trump titled “Improving oversight of federal grantmaking” with several stipulations on which grants can be approved. 
Grunwald said the order will likely mean fewer grant opportunities and could slow the release of money. 
“It could have devastating effects on total awards for 2026,” Grunwald said during the Legislature’s Higher Education Institutions Committee meeting in Dickinson, North Dakota. 
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

Trump’s executive order is critical of National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation research. It said one 2024 study claimed that more than one-quarter of new National Science Foundation grants “went to diversity, equity, and inclusion and other far-left initiatives.” It did not name the study. 
It also noted that a “substantial portion” of some grants goes to university facilities and administrative costs.
“Awards must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities,” the order stated, and can’t promote “anti-American values.” 
Grant cancellations
UND has already had eight awards canceled, resulting in the loss of more than $3 million, mostly from the Department of Health and Human Services, Snyder said. This includes three National Institutes of Health grants. 
One funded a program called U-RISE, which trained eight undergraduate students to become biomedical researchers. 
The program provided students with a stipend for their work, though that money dried up in February when NIH canceled the grant, Snyder told the North Dakota Monitor. UND lost roughly $900,000 that it expected to receive over the next three years for the program.
“My office went ahead and covered their pay for the rest of the semester,” Snyder said in an interview. “We wanted to make sure that these students had a way to eat, they had a way to drive their cars.”
UND also lost a little less than $150,000 in grant money from the NIH for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health Equity Ambassador program, which “supports CDC employees in sharing information about public health careers and promoting healthy behaviors,” according to the university.
The NIH also terminated a grant that supported mentorship and training opportunities for predoctoral students. The award — which funded a graduate student’s research on breast cancer — was in its last year, so UND did not lose any money from the cancellation, according to the school.
Keeping the lights on
Snyder and Grunwald told lawmakers about the impact of potential changes on facilities and administrative costs that federal funding will cover. 
Universities negotiate how much money can be applied to keep the lights on, keep buildings maintained and pay for some salaries for people not directly involved in research, such as custodians and finance staff. 
Grunwald said the Trump administration is trying to cap the rate at 15%. 
UND calculated the potential loss at $15 million per year; NDSU’s estimate was $9 million per year. 
Snyder said there is more than $1 million at risk in funding for the Energy and Environmental Research Center and the College of Engineering and Mines at UND.  
“The Department of Energy is where we’re having our biggest challenges in getting the money to flow,” Snyder told committee members. 
Health agencies scramble as North Dakota loses federal grants

EERC Director Charles Gorecki said in an interview that the Department of Energy is slow to announce new projects. 
Snyder told the legislative committee that UND is 30% to 40% behind the pace of federally funded projects compared with last year. 
Grunwald said NDSU, in fiscal year 2024, had 799 awards worth $142 million, and that dropped to 693 awards worth $92 million in fiscal year 2025.
“This is in part due to inaction by agencies from January 2025 to the present,” she said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture research funding is shrinking, Grunwald said, but the tax break and spending cut measure that Republicans call the “big, beautiful bill” does have money for agricultural research facilities like NDSU through the USDA. 
Snyder said there is some reason for optimism. Members of some Senate subcommittees are pushing back on research cuts and trying to keep funding rate for facilities and administrative costs flat. 
 “The 15% would be very damaging to our institutions,” Snyder said.

(Getty Images)Picture in your mind this image repeated thousands of times in Idaho over the last few weeks. An anxious mom or dad taking an equally anxious young child to the bus stop or all the way to school for the very first time. Tears are shed, hugs are held a little longer, and soon, their little one is off to face the unknown.
This year, about 100 Idaho families will take their young child to a doctor’s office or the hospital to also face a different unknown. Data suggests that about 100 Idaho children will be diagnosed with cancer this year – most likely leukemia or lymphoma. In 2023, 10 Idaho children did not survive their battle with cancer.
These Idaho ‘angels’ provide a cancer support service where it counts

In 1990, President George H.W. Bush established September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This month is dedicated to raising awareness about childhood cancer, supporting families affected by the disease, and advocating for research and treatment advancements.
Since 1969, Idaho hospitals have collaborated with the Cancer Data Registry of Idaho to collect and curate information about cancer diagnosed among Idaho residents – including children. This is possible thanks to funding from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Idaho Legislature, and the Idaho Hospital Association.
Remarkable progress has been made in treating pediatric cancer over the last 50 years. Today, 9 in 10 Idaho children diagnosed with cancer are still alive five years after their diagnosis, and more than half of Idaho children with cancer are enrolled in a clinical trial through an Idaho hospital.  
Still, rates of malignant melanoma in Idaho kids are among the highest in the country. Forty percent of Idaho children diagnosed with malignant melanoma are younger than 15 years old. Melanoma is one cancer that is largely preventable simply by using sun protection. The Society for Pediatric Dermatology recommends sun-protective clothing and broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher be used to protect kids from harmful UV rays. 
The effects of pediatric cancer can last a lifetime. The Cancer Data Registry of Idaho’s most recent report states, “Studies show that adult survivors of childhood cancer are more likely to have adverse health outcomes later in life. They are at risk for higher health care expenditures and lost productivity, compared to adults without a history of childhood cancer. Education, intervention programs, and ongoing follow-up care are important for improving health and economic outcomes associated with cancer survivorship in this population.” 
Idaho’s hospitals are committed to helping raise awareness about childhood cancer. Our goal, and the goal of the Cancer Data Registry of Idaho, is to support the research that benefits families in their individual battles with cancer and to hopefully, one day, help win the war against this disease.

Mensah killed Cole on Feb. 2 2020 following a foot pursuit at Mayfair Mall, during which Mensah said Cole pointed a gun at him. 
Dr. Weislaw Tlomak, chief medical examiner in Milwaukee County, performed the autopsy of Cole’s body the morning after he was killed. Using diagrams and a manikin , she described in detail the gunshot wounds Cole sustained after running from police in the Mayfair Mall parking lot. 
One of the most discussed wounds on Cole’s body was a gunshot wound to his forearm. Tlomak explained that it came from a shot at close range. 
Attorneys representing the Cole family argued that Cole shot himself in the arm as he ran, causing him to fall to the ground. Cole’s other wounds were also discussed in detail, with autopsy photos shown to the jury for the first time. When the case first went to trial in March, ending in a hung jury, autopsy photos were not shown. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
As Tlomak testified, U.S. Marshals streamed in and out of the courtroom, their presence more noticeable than on Monday. At one point during testimony, four fully uniformed Wauwatosa officers sat on the far side of the courtroom in full view of the jury. One of them sat next to Mensah’s wife, herself a former Milwaukee police officer. At least one of the officers, Ralph Salyers, had been on the scene of Mensah’s second shooting in 2016 of Jay Anderson Jr., and was offered immunity by special prosecutors in 2021 when that shooting was re-examined under the state’s John Doe laws. The officers sat for hours listening to testimony. Cole was the third person killed by Mensah during his five years at Wauwatosa PD. 
Milwaukee police detective Lori Rom, who served as part of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team in 2020, testified, “Everybody sees and hears stuff different.” Rom and her partner William Schroeder, with whom she helped investigate the Cole shooting, said they were unable to talk to Mensah or officer Evan Olson, who’d left the scene and had to be interviewed with their lawyers. 
Both detectives testified that officers involved in fatal incidents need to be separated in order to avoid contaminating or influencing statements. Rom and Schroeder testified that officers should know better than to talk to each other. Both detectives admitted that they were surprised to learn from plaintiff attorneys on Tuesday that Mensah and Olson had gone off in a squad car together, and that Olson may have even driven Mensah back to the police department. “I would be surprised,” said Rom. “That’s typically not what you’re supposed to do. They should know not to do that.” No officer or supervisor told the investigators that officers hadn’t been separated, an important detail both Rom and Schroeder said they expected their colleagues to share with them.
Rom and Schroeder both said that no officers reached out to them to say that their reports were inaccurate after reviewing them. Their interviews with officers were not recorded, a common practice of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team. Schroeder testified that an attorney from the Cermele Law Office, who regularly represented police officers, refused to allow his clients to be recorded.
Attorneys attempted to read other officer interviews from the Cole shooting investigation, but were struck down by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelmen, who agreed with defense attorneys that the reports were hearsay. One of those reports described a Wauwatosa officer, Maria Albiter, who was approached by Olson as she sat with Mensah, and told that he would sit with the officer instead.  
Plaintiff attorneys played sections of squad car video which captured Mensah and Olson going to a squad car together before deactivating the video and both of their lapel microphones. In another clip, Shamsi can be heard talking to Wauwatosa officer Dexter Schleis about the shooting, with plaintiff attorney’s posing that Schleis can be heard promising not to tell anyone that they talked at the end. When Schleis, who is still a Wauwatosa officer, later took the stand and heard the clip, he denied having said that.

A major issue in the case is the contradicting statements between Shamsi, Olson, and Mensah. Whereas Shamsi was closest to Cole when he was shot and said the teen’s gun hadn’t moved at all, Olson and Mensah said that Cole raised the gun at each of them. Olson and Mensah were on opposite ends of the parking lot. Plaintiff attorneys argue that the gun couldn’t have been pointed at them both, while Mensah’s defense attorneys suggested in opening statements Monday that Cole pointed the gun at both officers. 
Mensah himself took the stand Tuesday afternoon. As in the last trial, he answered many questions asked by plaintiff attorneys with “I don’t remember” or “I don’t recall”. Mensah testified that after hearing the first gunshot as he chased Cole, he pulled out his own weapon. When Mensah saw a gun in Cole’s hand, he tensed his body and prepared to be shot, he said, describing it as a sort of “burning” sensation and fear. 
“It’s dark, it’s a stressful situation,” said Mensah. “Just because I remember one thing doesn’t mean I’ll remember another.” Yet the muzzle of Cole’s gun was something that Mensah testified that he won’t forget. “It’s not just me I’m protecting,” said Mensah. “It’s everyone else there as well.”
Mensah said that he fired until he felt the threat had been stopped, and that after the shooting he was very distraught and crying. Olson came to comfort him, and although Mensah said he couldn’t remember aspects of their time together, he told the jury that the two did not talk about the shooting at all. Mensah also couldn’t recall why his video and audio stopped once the two got into the car together. Mensah said he didn’t understand why Cole didn’t stop and drop the gun. “I didn’t want to get shot,” said Mensah. “I didn’t want to die.”
The day ended with testimony from Ricky Burems, a former Milwaukee police detective with 32 years experience, and Schleis. Burems spoke about his experience with Defense and Arrest Tactics (DAAT), a standardized use of force training police officers in most states including Wisconsin receive.

DAAT should be interpreted as what a hypothetical reasonable officer with the same training would do, Burems testified, adding  that even when deadly force is used, the purpose is not to kill someone but to stop an imminent threat. Dialogue, not deadly force, is emphasized in DAAT training, Burems testified. If an officer fires, then after each shot is taken an officer needs to re-evaluate whether the threat still exists, he said. When firing, an officer must also consider what is beyond his target, such as civilians or other officers who may be struck. When questioned by defense attorneys, he said that although he’s trained many officers over his career, that he is not a certified DAAT instructor, and that there are circumstances where officers may rely on deadly force immediately. 
The day ended with Schleis, one of the officers who responded to Mayfair Mall in 2020, recounting how he arrived at the mall, responding to a call about a disorderly suspect who may have had a gun. Officers encountered a group of teens outside the mall, one of whom matched the description of the subject they were looking for. The group ran. Schelis was arresting one of the teens when he heard the first shot go off, followed by several more. Schleis, like other officers, testified that foot chases are remarkably unpredictable and dangerous. Asked about talking to other officers on scene, he denied telling Shamsi that he wouldn’t tell anyone that they’d talked, something plaintiff attorneys argued was captured on camera. 
By the end of the day, the four Wauwatosa officers who’d watched portions of the trial left and Wauwatosa PD Captain Luke Vetter arrived to watch testimony from the gallery, wearing a civilian suit with a badge on the breast pocket. Plaintiff attorneys rested their case Tuesday, with more witnesses expected to be called by the defense Wednesday before the case is handed over to the jury.

The passage of a major bill in Texas threatens the national safety net that has allowed tens of thousands of Americans to get around abortion bans.
House Bill 7 targets health care providers in states such as California, New York and Massachusetts that have, since the fall of Roe v. Wade, used telehealth to prescribe abortion pills. Interacting with patients virtually, those providers never leave their home states, which have laws explicitly protecting them from out-of-state prosecution. Those protections hold even if the patient is located in a state with a ban, like Texas. Only eight states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — have those protections in place for health providers.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

House Bill 7 gives anti-abortion activists a new tool that heightens the risk for medical professionals. It says any private citizen can bring a civil lawsuit, with a minimum payout of $100,000, against anyone who makes medication abortion available to a Texan. That includes prescribing, mailing and distributing pills. The bill’s authors have also said it would allow suits against drug manufacturers.
The Texas bill is yet to be signed by the state’s Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and would not take effect until the first week of December. But if it successfully lowers the number of abortions done in Texas, it’s likely to inspire similar legislation in other states with bans.
“We need to be thinking about this as a blueprint,” said Jessica Waters, a legal scholar at American University who specializes in reproductive rights. “Texas is taking this unprecedented action. It’s the first of its type to really target out-of-state abortion providers, and I think we will see more states do this.”
Some experts and shield law providers told The 19th that the bill could stop some abortion pills from being mailed to Texas. The legal risks to shield law providers mean that relatively few health professionals offer telehealth abortions to people in states like Texas — amplifying the possible consequences if any decide to stop.
“There probably will be some shield providers who stop sending pills into Texas because of the law because they’re taking great personal risk to do so,” said Elisa Wells, who runs the website Plan C, a clearinghouse of telehealth abortion options.

Already, the election of President Donald Trump has deterred some health providers from offering telehealth abortions to people living under bans, said Rebecca Nall, who runs the website INeedanA, a comprehensive database of abortion providers.
Some policy analysts argued that if HB 7 drives out just a few more health providers, it could seriously limit who in Texas can get abortions.
“Even if it’s just a small impact on the availability of care or availability of medication abortion in the state, it can have a really big impact,” said Kimya Forouzan, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
A week before the bill’s passage, one California-based telehealth provider told The 19th that the recent onslaught of lawsuits against providers has left her increasingly unsure of how long she will be able to continue offering abortions to people in other states. She declined to speak further after HB 7 passed.
“Every day it feels like it’s very tenuous,” said the doctor, who asked that her name be withheld because of the risk of incurring a lawsuit. “It feels like things are ramping up.”
Debra Lynch, a nurse who runs the shield law practice called Her Safe Harbor, said she is now in regular communication with other health professionals who worry HB 7 will make it too dangerous to continue offering telehealth abortions to Texans, despite the protections of their state laws.
“We’re hearing from other providers that have large on-the-ground practices: Is it worth it for them to continue to take this risk by providing a telehealth service, if it’s going to pose a risk to their on-ground practice?” she said. “They’re concerned. If they continue to do the telehealth abortion, is that going to, through civil action, pose a big threat to their ability to maintain their in-person clinics?”
Confusion over maternal care medication plagues politics in Louisiana and beyond

Still, several shield law providers said that they intend to continue offering telehealth abortions to Texans, even after the new legislation takes effect.
“We’re talking with lawyers and other stakeholders, but right now we don’t anticipate changing anything about our practice,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who runs the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project. “We believe our shield law protects us from these civil lawsuits.”
Health providers are only one component of the telehealth abortion ecosystem, and it’s not yet clear how others, such as drug distributors or pharmaceutical manufacturers, will react to the threat of new financial penalties. Both Danco and GenBioPro, the two main U.S. manufacturers of one of the key drugs used in medication abortions, declined to comment on how they intend to respond to HB 7.
That said, “the legislation is aimed at disincentivizing online pharmacies and manufacturers from sending medications into the state altogether,” said Nimra Chowdhry, senior state legislative counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights.
John Seago, the head of the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, said in a statement that he believes HB 7 can offer a blueprint for other states seeking to block telehealth abortions. The largest state to ban abortion, Texas has for more than a decade served as a testing ground for restrictive policies that, when effective, have been copied around the country. Texas was also the first state to outlaw most abortions, enacting a six-week ban in 2021 — months before the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe.
Despite sustained pressure from national abortion opponents, the White House has not taken action to block telehealth abortions. If this law is effective at doing so — a key goal for abortion opponents, who remain frustrated over the large swath of patients still able to access care — similar legislation is likely to emerge in conservative-led statehouses across the country.
“It certainly is a shot across the bow, to be very public and loud about taking on shield laws and ending mailed medication abortion in the state of Texas,” said Rachel Rebouché, a professor of law at the University of Texas Austin. “I’m not sure it changes what’s happening yet — and that’s what I think we’re all waiting to see.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Abortion opponents across the country have been focused on finding a way to stop telehealth abortions. Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician, is a defendant in criminal and separate civil lawsuits put forth by the Louisiana and Texas attorneys general. Two Texas individuals — both represented by the anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, who helped craft HB 7 — have also filed wrongful death suits against out-of-state health care providers. One suit targets California-based Dr. Remy Coeytaux, and the other is against the telehealth organization Aid Access.
Lawmakers from states with shield laws have suggested that they will defend organizations and individuals making telehealth abortions available to Texans.
A spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta said that state’s chief law enforcement officer “stands ready to enforce California’s robust laws that protect patients, providers, and those assisting in abortion access.” This week, New York Attorney General Letitia James intervened in a Texas-based lawsuit that argues the Empire State’s shield law is unconstitutional.
Texas lawmakers are divided on whether their new bill passes constitutional muster, with several state Democrats arguing that its provisions could violate the U.S. and state constitutions. And abortion opponents disagree on how successful it will be in stopping telehealth abortions.
Seago said in a statement that the bill is “the most effective Pro-Life defense against out-of-state companies and activists that send abortion pills to Texas.” But another anti-abortion activist, Texans for Life head Kyleen Wright, called it “vastly oversold” in its ability to halt telehealth. She pointed out that Texas law already offers a mechanism to sue people who help residents get abortions — the six-week abortion ban that took effect in 2021 — but that nobody has used that law’s civil suit offering to try to block telehealth.
In Texas, women like Raquel are grappling with what the end of telehealth would mean. The mother of two living near Houston discovered last fall that she was pregnant, despite using contraception. She feared for her life — the last time she had given birth, her postpartum depression had been so powerful that she had required hospitalization.
“I never want to be back in that situation where I wanted to end my life because of how I felt — I couldn’t do that to my children, I couldn’t do it to my husband, I couldn’t do it to my family in general,” she said. “It was life or death.”
Raquel, who asked to be referred to by her middle name because few people know about her abortion, ordered medication from Aid Access. Beyond talking with someone at the organization, Raquel discussed her decision with her doctor and her therapist. Her husband, whose job often requires months of travel at once, took time off from work to stay home with her during the abortion.
But even without a telehealth option, she said, she would have found a way to end her pregnancy: driving 15 hours to Colorado, or finding a way to Mexico for care. She expressed anger about the state’s effort to eliminate that path — and fear about what it could mean for other people in situations like hers.
“It pisses me off because it’s really nobody’s business but your own,” she said. “And it’s sad because now these women — and potentially me — we have to go through twice as much to receive care if that’s what we so choose to do. And that’s just not right. It’s not fair, and we’re going backwards in time.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia is making progress in addressing staffing shortages in its crowded jails and prisons, but hundreds of positions remain unfilled. David Kelly, commissioner for the state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told lawmakers that it continues to be one of the major problems in the division.
“As of July, we have over 410 vacancies,” he said Tuesday to members of the Legislative Oversight Committee on Corrections and Public Safety. “I want to find a way to bring those vacancies down and we are working diligently.”
He added, “We’ve trained over 1,000 [new employees] since January 2024. That’s an amazing statistic.”
Kelly stepped into the role of commissioner in June after serving as a Republican lawmaker in the House of Delegates. While in the state Legislature, he chaired a committee on jails and prisons and championed raises for correctional officers during a staffing crisis that prompted a state of emergency from 2022 through last year.
But the 2023 raises and hiring bonuses under former Gov. Jim. Justice — which cost $21 million — only included uniformed officers, leaving out non-uniformed staff in jails like cooks, counselors and more.
“They did not get a raise like the uniformed staff did. They are a vital and intricate part of the daily operations of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation,” Kelly said. 
The state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation has a more than $354 million budget for 16 correctional facilities, correctional officer salaries and more. The state’s juvenile correctional services under DCR has a separate budget of roughly $57 million. 
Kelly said that multiple counties are unable to pay their jail bills, pushing the cost onto the state. West Virginia counties pay the state per inmate per day to house inmates at regional jails.
“There are counties that simply cannot pay … and that’s because of the counties’ financial situations,” he said. “When they cannot pay, it costs the state more.”
There are good things happening in the corrections system, Kelly said, noting a program that pairs incarcerated persons with shelter animals for training and care. Through a Paws from Prison Program, the dogs are later given to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder or children with disabilities for therapy purposes. 
“The program has proven to be transformative. It boosts morale of our inmate population who is doing this,” Kelly said. “It teaches responsibility and builds empathy. That prepares inmates with successful reintegration into society.”
Kelly is focused on rehabilitation when possible and keeping the state’s recidivism rate low. But, he explained that there are challenges reintegrating people back into the community, especially when it comes to finding employment and housing. 
Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha
He noted that it costs the state $90.16 per day for each incarcerated person. Medical expenses are contributing to that cost. 
“We currently have 11 inmates who have been granted parole and have exhausted all means for housing,” Kelly said. “Most of those are sex offenders or others who have medical issues … We’re still trying to find an adequate house for people who need to be able to move on.” 
Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, also said that housing was a challenge for inmates who had completed their time with DCR. “I know when I was on the parole board, housing was a huge issue for those inmates who were ready and parole qualified,” he said.
Decision to serve inmates less meals on weekends reversed
Kelly also told lawmakers that DCR has reversed its recent decision to serve incarcerated persons two meals per day on weekends instead of three.  
Lewis questioned the thought behind the change, prompting Kelly to explain that the division was testing serving two meals with the same caloric count and nutritional count that would be found in three meals to see if it was feasible. A lot of food was thrown out on the weekends, he said. 
Kelly said it was a test “that did not work.” 
“When we roll out a program and it doesn’t meet our standard of excellence, we’re not going to keep it,” he said. “We rolled it back immediately, and we got things back to three meals a day.”
Ahead of the meeting, family members of incarcerated West Virginians and clergy members delivered letters to Kelly asking him to fix problems with the food served in state jails and prisons. 
“Although this decision was walked back, there’s no guarantee DCR won’t try to serve fewer meals again. West Virginia jails and prisons are also notorious for serving small portions of food that are overprocessed, lacking in fresh nutrients and sometimes rotten or spoiled,” a press release said. “As the families of incarcerated West Virginians, we believe our loved ones deserve to be treated with respect.”

During the war, Denorris Howell was strangled to death. No one was charged with his killing.
Howell was one of 42 people who died by homicide in Mississippi prisons over the past decade, a toll uncovered by a reporting team that includes Mississippi Today, The Marshall Project – Jackson, the Clarion Ledger, Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link. Total convictions in those cases? Six.
“Oh, my God, there’s something wrong with that picture,” said Howell’s great aunt, Annie Moffitt, who runs Annie’s Home Cooking in Holly Springs, where he once worked.
Parchman’s gang war came after years of neglect by state officials, who slashed millions in funding and allowed conditions at the prison to deteriorate after federal courts ended oversight of the facility in 2011, according to an investigation by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting, now a part of Mississippi Today, and ProPublica.

The U.S. Department of Justice later blamed the war and the violence leading up to it on inadequate staffing, cursory investigations, insufficient security measures, unfettered access to contraband and uncontrolled gang activity. 
“These systemic failures result in an environment rife with weapons, drugs, gang activity, extortion, and violence,” the report said.
Mississippi Department of Corrections officials said they referred only one of the three homicides in three days to prosecutors. Overall, the agency referred 15 of the 42 homicides to prosecutors over the past decade, and said in a recent statement that it “remains committed to ensuring the safety of inmates in its custody.”
David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project, called these numbers inconceivably low. “I can’t imagine any other law enforcement agency failing to refer three-fourths of the homicides under its jurisdiction to prosecutors,” he said. “These victims’ lives are not seen as sufficiently valuable to warrant the effort.”
After the gang war, Gov. Tate Reeves hired the former head of Angola, Louisiana’s most notorious prison, to clean up Parchman and the other prisons. The Mississippi Legislature passed raises for correctional officers.
But the violence that initially declined under Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain’s leadership is now back on the rise. With five killings already, 2025 marks Mississippi’s worst year for prison homicides since 2021.
Fatal response to a dispute over money
Denorris “Nod” Howell grew up in the Waterford community between Oxford and Holly Springs, the eldest of three children.
“He was a good young man who treated all of us with the ultimate respect,” recalled Moffitt, his great aunt. “He loved his grandmother, who was my sister.”
After the teen shot up to 6-foot-1, he played power forward for Holly Springs High School and graduated in 2001.
“Denorris was a good kid,” said his mother, Janice Wilkins. “He was an obedient child. I didn’t have much problems out of him growing up, other than him being a typical teenager.”

Unlike others, he and his brother didn’t hang out in clubs, she said. “When kids grow up, they venture out and do their own thing, but as long as you are in my house, you have rules.”
After graduating, Howell moved out and got married. He and his wife had four children. He worked a series of odd jobs, first at a warehouse in Oxford and then at his great aunt’s restaurant.
In 2010, Howell and a friend were at his home when LaKeith Jones arrived. According to testimony, Howell had recently sold a car to Jones, who still owed him money. Once Jones paid the remaining balance, Howell would give him the keys.
The conversation between them grew heated. Howell shot Jones five times.
Howell called 911 and told the dispatcher that he had shot Jones in self-defense because he thought Jones was about to pull out a pistol. He later told a deputy that he had not wanted to shoot Jones, but that Jones was robbing him and had robbed him four times in the past.
Sheriff’s investigators did not find a pistol on Jones’ body, and none of the witnesses who testified at Howell’s trial said that Jones had a weapon.
In 2012, a jury convicted Howell of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 17 years and began serving that time at Parchman, one of the nation’s most infamous prisons.
The maximum security prison holds up to 2,542 men in seven buildings, surrounded by an 18,000-acre working farm. The prison’s long history of violence and abuse has been documented by journalists, researchers, filmmakers and blues singers.
‘I was praying that he was safe’

After her son began serving his time in Parchman, two hours away, Wilkins began working locally at the Marshall County Correctional Facility, where she taught incarcerated men how to give haircuts.
The whole time there, she thought of her son, she said. “I was praying that he was safe.”
Through her classes, men learned all styles of cuts, and she said prison officials grew to appreciate her. “They call me ‘Boss Lady,’ the one that everybody loves,” she said.
After a year of instruction, the men “know what they’re doing,” she said. “They get a license just like mine,” she said, flashing her own license from the state Board of Cosmetology and Barbering.
Many of those she taught have left prison far behind. “They’re in barber shops, and some of them have ventured out and gotten their own shop,” she said. “They’re just doing really good.”
While she worked, she waited for her son’s release. He had told her that he might come home as early as 2020, because he could be paroled after serving half his sentence. 
She began to plan for a huge family gathering to welcome him home, complete with chicken, fish, frog legs, shrimp, crab legs and vegetables — all the food he loved.
‘Ain’t nothing under control’
In the waning days of 2019, a war between the Vice Lords and the Gangster Disciples spread across Mississippi prisons.
In hopes of preventing the violence from spreading, Parchman officials locked down the men in their cells to prevent their movement.
Despite this, Walter Gates, 25, who was serving a 10-year sentence for burglary from Coahoma County, was stabbed to death on New Year’s Day at Parchman. Roosevelt Holliman, 32, who was serving 12 years for armed robbery and burglary out of Forrest County, met the same fate a day later. Two suspects in the Holliman killing are pending trial.
Reeves declared in a Jan. 3, 2020, tweet, “Grateful to those working to restore order and safety. That is the first priority. Then we need answers and justice on the people who perpetrated this violence.”
The Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting received a series of text messages and videos during that war from people in the prisons and their loved ones.
A message sent on Jan. 2 identified a female correctional officer in Unit 29 “giving inmates keys right now, and my brothers have no one to alert.”
A similar message followed on a private Facebook page, accusing the same officer of cutting off lights.
A screengrab from a video filmed by a prisoner on a contraband phone in January 2020 shows a cell in darkness, while the rest of the unit is lit. 
Photos and videos showed men in red-and-white-striped uniforms, reserved for people convicted of the most violent crimes, walking freely through Unit 29, with no correctional officers in sight.
The message from inside Parchman continued: “If MDOC thinks they have control, they are very mistaken.”
In a video recorded during the unrest on a contraband mobile phone, a cell sits in darkness while other parts of the prison are lit.
Loud shouting can be heard as an incarcerated person inside the cell appears to be punching someone. A prisoner recording the video narrates, “They’re straight up hitting the motherf—ers with knives and sh–, beating them motherf—ers up.”
A man can be heard saying, “I’ve got him in a chokehold.”
Another voice cheers him on: “Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Dead. Oh, yeah. Dead. Deaaaaad.”
Despite the loud shouting throughout the incident captured on video, no officer can be seen responding.
At 3 a.m. on Jan. 3, an officer called additional staff to the Unit 29 building, where they found Howell’s body in his cell. His cellmate, who had been stabbed repeatedly and whose name was blacked out on the incident report, was taken by ambulance to the hospital. At 4:22 a.m., the coroner pronounced Howell dead.
The coroner ruled that Howell’s cellmate had strangled him to death in self-defense.
By the time the governor decided to shut down Unit 29 on Jan. 28, five prisoners at Parchman had been killed, and dozens had been injured. Three others were found hanging in their cells. MDOC ruled their deaths suicides.
Detrick Munford, who was a captain over Unit 29 then and later served as Parchman’s deputy warden, said he heard on the evening of Jan. 2 about a female officer allegedly sharing her keys with prisoners. He said he confronted her and took her keys.
After that, he opened an investigation into the officer’s actions to determine if she had a relationship with a gang, he said. “When she found out, she quit.”
He sent his findings to the prison’s investigators, he said. “They take it from there.”
No charges were ever brought against the officer, who was never identified in any department report. She said in text messages recently that prisoners lied about her, that she was never investigated by MDOC and that she wasn’t even at work that night. MDOC has not responded to requests for her timesheets.
No one ever got her keys, she wrote. “I was the one lied on.”
She said after Howell’s death, Munford checked that she had her keys.
Munford said he knows of some cases where correctional officers did favors for gangs. He said he also knows of several cases where correctional officers enabled violence against those behind bars, but he doesn’t know of any cases where officers were prosecuted.
Munford said officers can cut off the lights to an individual cell.
Parchman is located in a rural area where there are few jobs, he said. “People tend to think they can’t do no better, so you have to go along with the system.”
If people refuse to “go along with the system, they’ll find a way to get you out of the way,” he said. “There’s so much corruption.”
Within weeks after Howell’s death, two more men were killed at Parchman. Prison officials tried to reassure the public that these were isolated incidents. 
“We have been working around the clock with MDOC and DPS [the Department of Public Safety] to respond immediately and prevent this going forward,” Reeves tweeted on Jan. 21, 2020.
In the wake of the killings, Reeves appointed Cain as corrections commissioner to clean up the prisons and restore safety.
By the end of that year, six people had been killed at Parchman and three more in other parts of the state’s prison system. No one has been convicted in connection with any of the deaths.
‘He told me that he feared for his life’
On Jan. 3, 2020, Wilkins got a call from the chaplain that her son was dead. Since then, she said, she has received no other details about his death and no autopsy report.

“I just felt empty,” she said. 
She paused. “Sometimes it feels like it just happened yesterday.”
She had just talked to her son the night before, and he sounded nervous, she said. “He told me that he feared for his life.”
She said her son told her that the lights had been turned out and that a guard was letting men out of their cells.
Years later, she heard a rumor from the men she worked with at the Marshall County Correctional Facility that her son’s cellmate had been killed in prison, but it offered her little solace. “I don’t wish that on nobody,” she said. She later found out that the rumor was false. 
Today, five years after his death, Wilkins continues to have questions. No one from the prison has ever explained what happened to her son, she said. 
“Justice needs to be served,” she said. “My son had four children who loved him very dearly.”

Two neighboring townships in a heavily fracked part of Pennsylvania are seeking federal and state funding for a public water system to replace private wells that have been contaminated for more than three years.
Freeport and Springhill townships in Greene County the southwest corner of the state have each recently used the contamination to declare a “disaster emergency” because of their long-running water problems. The declarations allow a municipality to apply for public funds to fix a problem.
The Greene County communities are believed to be the first in the state to use the emergency declaration in relation to drinking-water contamination, said Guy Hostutler, chairman of the Freeport Board of Supervisors, which published its statement in June. Neighboring Springhill issued its own disaster declaration in August.
Since fracking for natural gas began in Pennsylvania in the mid-2000s, some residents have complained that their water, if drawn from aquifers, has been contaminated with hazardous chemicals used in fracking. In those cases, residents are forced to rely on bottled or filtered water, or on “buffaloes”—large plastic tanks installed outside homes and periodically filled with clean water.
Critics of the gas industry blame the contamination on “frac-outs,” in which fracking fluid pumped underground at high pressure leaks from its borehole into aquifers or escapes from the surface. Such incidents have polluted some drinking water sources and delayed the construction of gas wells or pipelines.
In Freeport’s case, around 200 of its approximately 300 residents have experienced discolored and chemically contaminated water since June 2022, Hostutler said. That month, the gas company EQT experienced a “frac-out” as it was horizontally drilling a nearby well.
Since then, affected homeowners have been unable to use their wells and have relied instead on water from buffaloes or filtration. EQT has provided both while not acknowledging that it had anything to do with water conditions there, Public Source reported last year.
The well water has been tested by Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection, which determined in February that the water is not fit for human consumption. Freeport then approved the disaster declaration that allows it to seek public funding for a public water system.
“We filed it because we felt it was our best option to try to get funding to try to get a water line laid to the residents of the Freeport-Springhill area,” Hostutler said in an interview. “We’re a very small township and the rough estimate for the water line is between $21 and $25 million. We don’t have anything close to that, so we are going to need state funding as well as federal funding to get the water line laid.”
Hostutler backed away from the declaration’s claim that EQT was responsible for the contamination. The document said that “on or about June 19, 2022, a contamination event caused by actions of EQT has caused or threatens to cause injury, damage, and suffering to persons and property of Freeport Township.”
But in the interview, Hostutler said the contamination could have been caused by other parties, such as pipeline builders or operators of conventional gas wells. Township solicitor Grant Allison said the municipality is acknowledging the possibility but is not excluding EQT.
“There are other companies performing work in the area, and it would not be prudent for the Township to disqualify all other actors while there are still active investigations ongoing,” Allison wrote in an email. “The Township is not absolving EQT by any means.”
Allison said the disaster declaration is not connected to a pending class-action lawsuit by affected Freeport residents, accusing EQT of contaminating water and exposing residents to potentially harmful chemicals. The suit, filed in June 2024, states that Pennsylvania officials have reported some 400 cases of gas-industry impacts on underground water supplies since 2007.
Asked why it took three years for the town to issue its disaster declaration, Hostutler said it had to wait for the DEP to conclude that some private wells contained water unfit for human consumption. He declined to identify the contaminants found in the private well water, saying that information is part of the residents’ lawsuit.
Even if money is found for a public water system, it could be three or four years before it’s in place, Hostutler said.
EQT did not respond to two emails seeking comment. The Marcellus Shale Coalition, a trade group for the gas industry, also did not respond.
The DEP investigated 24 cases in which Freeport residents claimed the industry contaminated their wells, but it found no evidence of such a link, said Neil Shader, a spokesman for the agency. Still, the DEP is now looking into more recent complaints, including one that the township’s water source for washing vehicles and other non-drinking purposes has been contaminated by unconventional gas drilling.
The Center for Coalfield Justice, an advocacy group for workers in the coal and gas industries and nearby residents in southwest Pennsylvania, has provided drinking water for some affected residents. It has also pressed EQT to pay for restoring water supplies that CCJ contends the company contaminated. But after the disaster declarations, the group fears EQT is hoping to avoid the cost.
“EQT is interested in letting taxpayers pay the cost of cleaning up their mess,” said CCJ’s executive director, Sarah Martik. “Since federal and state representatives have got involved, the conversation has gone from holding EQT accountable to providing public water. Now it’s, ‘Let’s get taxpayer dollars to pay for that.’”
Residents fear additional contamination, Martik added.
“Clearly there is a pathway for the fracking fluids to be engaging in the aquifer,” she said. “People were saying, ‘As soon as I bathed in this water, I got rashes’; ‘my tomato plants died after I watered with this’; ‘my dogs won’t go anywhere near this water.’ People just don’t necessarily have clean water.”
Now that the townships have issued their disaster declarations, some state lawmakers are pledging to help find public funding to fix the water problems. They include Rep. Bud Cook, a Republican who urged Freeport officials to approach PennVest, a financing authority that offers low-cost loans for municipal infrastructure projects that address water and other public needs.
“I am saddened to hear about the ongoing water-quality issues in Freeport Township, and the recent declaration of a Disaster Emergency,” Cook wrote to the town’s supervisors in July. “Please know that my office is here as a resource throughout the process.”
The office of U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican who represents the area, did not respond to questions about whether he supports finding federal dollars to help pay for public water in the townships.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/natural-gas-well-site-1024x570.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 05:56:17.068849

The event celebrates ""everyone’s favorite trash cat through art, crafts, games, food and fun."" (PossumFest Facebook page)Kenny Cody, a conservative writer and Republican activist from northeastern Tennessee, recently wrote an opinion column in Human Events which took aim at Kentucky’s own Tyler Childers, labeling him “nothing but a hick lib.” 
His argument boiled down to the idea that “Childers fell victim to Nashville, progressivism, the mainstream media, and the ‘hick lib’ mindset.” In other words, Childers had traded his authenticity for progressive politics and that his music and message no longer belong to Appalachia because they don’t match Cody’s idea of what Appalachia should be.  
As advertised by Kentucky for Kentucky.
I decided to take Cody’s framing for a test drive. 
My wife and I attended PossumFest last weekend in Cumberland, which is in Harlan County tucked right in between Harlan and Whitesburg, and I wore my “Hick Lib” t-shirt recently purchased from Kentucky for Kentucky. It felt like the perfect place to see how the phrase, weaponized in Cody’s column, would land among the very people he believes “hick liberalism” alienates.
Outfitted with my “Totally Opossum” cap and mirrored driver’s glasses, I walked through the festival crowd with my social scientist’s curiosity. Would folks scowl? Would I be politely ignored? Would somebody say something snide or argumentative? Or would the phrase just fly right over people’s heads?
My wife and I weren’t exactly blending in either. As I pushed her around town and the festival in her bright pink wheelchair, we were hard to miss. There wasn’t actually a parade at PossumFest, but if there had been, we probably could’ve rolled right in and passed for a float. Between the shirt, the cap and the hot pink wheels, we were about as subtle as a brass band.
And people noticed … but in the best way. The woman running Poor Folks Arts & Crafts flashed me a big thumbs-up. A merchant sitting outside her shop hollered across the street, “Love your shirt!!” Dozens of others smiled and said the same. More than a few asked, “Where can I get one like that?” No one seemed confused. No one seemed offended. Not a soul tried to run us out of town.
Culture over politics: What PossumFest made me remember
Part of why this struck me so strongly is that I’m not originally from Kentucky, although I’ve lived in Kentucky for the past 33 years. I grew up in rural Missouri, in a place once known for its “prairie progressives” — farmers and small-town folks who backed unions representing many of our fathers in the Kansas City automobile plants, supported our public schools by attending every home game, believed in the old FFA motto that began with the words, “I believe in the future of farming” and almost always voted Democrat.

That ground has since shifted, and today it votes solidly Republican. In that way, it mirrors Eastern Kentucky, which has taken its own long road from labor-Democrat loyalties to being ruby red on the political map.
But what I was once again reminded at PossumFest is that cultural identity in rural America is always more complex than what political pundits would have us believe. Communities don’t shed their history of resilience, compassion or creativity just because voting patterns change. Tyler Childers knows that, and his music reflects it. Appalachia, with its struggles and beauty, its stubborn independence and deep compassion, tells a story of a people who endure, adapt and care.
So if Cody wants to use “hick lib” as a slur, that’s his business. But from what I saw at PossumFest, Kentucky is more than ready to reclaim the label with a grin and a wink. Maybe, that’s the real story Cody missed: Appalachia isn’t afraid of change, or of artists like Kentucky’s very own Tyler Childers who dare to sing it into the open.
Don’t write off rural Kentucky
And for Democrats who have written off places like Harlan County, here’s a bit of advice: Don’t. Folks out there still care about the same things they always have like steady jobs, good schools, clean water, safe roads and fair wages. They haven’t lost their sense of community, or their pride. What they’ve lost, more often than not, is the feeling that anyone from outside the region still sees them.
If you want rural Kentuckians back, which you so often now claim you do, don’t do it with a consultant’s memo or a TV ad. Do it by showing up. Sit a spell and listen. Hey, why not even wander through a fall festival and strike up a conversation or two? You might be surprised how quickly doors open when people know you’re not just passing through or only looking for a vote.
Because out there, a “hick lib” is simply someone who belongs, someone who carries forward the mountain spirit, the stubborn pride, and the heart of Kentucky.  In other words, they’re Kentuckians just like the rest of us.

The mixed-income development downtown is a partnership between the Durham Housing Authority and developer Laurel Street Residential. It will replace 214 public housing units with 538 mixed-income homes, including 348 affordable units and 190 market-rate units. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the housing authority and City of Durham a $40 million Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grant to support the redevelopment.

“The important thing is that we are keeping a promise made to the community,” Anthony Snell, Interim CEO of the Durham Housing Authority said in an interview with NC Newsline. “The community made a major investment in us [housing authority] to be the leader in the delivery of housing.”
Snell acknowledged that some residents didn’t believe the housing authority would follow through on plans for the redevelopment. Some residents forced to move complained that there wasn’t enough affordable, safe housing available to replace the public housing that was demolished.
“I hope it is establishing a level of credibility, showing that we are indeed committed to what we say, and I hope it removes some level of uncertainty and anxiety about what it is we do,” Snell said. “But let’s face it, housing is such an essential element of one’s life, anytime you broach that subject, there’s always going to be a level of anxiety around.”
Snell noted that it has taken about seven years to get to the ribbon cutting for Vanguard Apartments and the groundbreaking for Dillard Street Apartments.
The groundbreaking and ribbon cutting took place on a sunny but breezy morning with 150 or more people in attendance, including such Durham dignitaries such as former mayors Bill Bell and Steve Schewel and former state senator Floyd McKissick. DJ Brian Dawson kept the crowd moving and on cue, played “Boots on the Ground,” which spawned the popular line dance by the same name, which Snell frequently referenced.
Vanguard is the first phase of the four-phase redevelopment of two public housing communities, 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments. Housing authority officials said 21 units are set aside for former residents of the former public housing communities.

Meanwhile, construction has begun on Phase 2, which is Commerce Street Apartments. Construction of the 172-unit project, with 88-units set aside for seniors and 84-units for families is expected to be completed in September 2026. Dillard Street Apartments is a 146-unit project with a June 2026 completion date. Sixty-four of units at Dillard Street Apartments are set aside for former Liberty Street Apartments residents. The fourth phase is Main Street, a 148-unit apartment complex for individuals and families. Construction on that projects is expected to begin next year.
Bianca Rivera, a Vanguard Apartments resident who lived in public housing with her son, said the new apartment was worth the wait.
“I’m happy and I feel safe,” Rivera said, explaining that she and her son were the victims of an attempted home invasion at their previous address.










“What started as a desire to redevelop two former public housing communities is now a choice neighborhood.


– Dionne Nelson


The redevelopment of 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments into a mixed income community comes as North Carolina and other parts of the nation face a severe housing shortage. A recent study commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that North Carolina has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
State Sen. Natalie Murdock, D-Durham, said Durham’s redevelopment reminds us why the federal government must continue to fund public housing.
“I’m really concerned about the federal government not wanting to provide money to housing authorities across the state and the nation,” Murdock said. “Everyone deserves a clean, safe place to live, so I’m thrilled that we are breaking ground today to deliver on that promise to residents that we would improve our housing conditions.”
Murdock said she believes there’s more state government can do to facilitate affordable housing across the state.

“We need more tax incentives to build affordable housing  but it has to be that plus more federal investments and it all has to all come together,” Murdock said.
Dionne Nelson, president and CEO of Laurel Street Residential, said Tuesday marked the company’s third ground breaking on the site.
“What started as a desire to redevelop two former public housing communities is now a choice neighborhood and City of Durham partnership that allowed us to accelerate the revitalization of this entire community,” Nelson said.
Durham Mayor Leo Williams said there are currently about 3,000 housing units in the pipeline for Durham.
“This is important work and we’re not just providing much needed affordable housing, we’re building communities and opportunities that all Durham residents can call home,” Williams said.
Williams noted that in 2019, Durham voters passed a $95 million affordable housing bond, which was at the time the largest in the state’s history. A portion of that bond was used for the first phase of the 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments redevelopment, he said.
Adam Abram, board chairman of the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, said the redevelopment project is an economic engine that will help Durham prosper.

“It creates wealth,” Abram said. “Think of all of the construction that’s going on around here. Think of the jobs. Think of the security of the people who are going to live here in these homes and their children.”
Anthony Scott, the former CEO of the Durham Housing Authority who resigned in December, attended the ribbon cutting ceremony. Scott had just arrived in Durham when plans for the redevelopment were unveiled.
“We talked about how we could do better at incorporating public housing residents into the larger fabric of Durham, and how we could create a better overall community, better social-economic environment,” Scott said. “To see yet another step for that coming through, is really exciting.”
He said public housing residents doubted whether the housing authority could live up to the promises it made regarding the redevelopment.
“This was the most challenging because so many people had to be relocated,” Scott said of The Vanguard Apartments. “There were so many concerns about what we would or would not be able to accomplish.”
Scott is soon heading to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he will work to bring affordable housing to that community.
“When you look at the affordable housing crisis the country is facing, the only way it’s going to change is people are going to have to decide that this important enough that we pressure Congress to allocate funding for it, we get HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] to do some things to make it easier for housing authorities.”
Combat high housing costs, which spiked during COVID pandemic, will require partnerships such as the ones that enabled the 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments redevelopment, he said.
“We must have our city, state and federal partners come in  and help us make these kinds of communities a reality,” Scott said.

Last school year, more than 430 students from 13 school districts and charter networks earned something new and powerful alongside their diplomas: the Seal of Climate Literacy. This credential — created in Colorado through Senate Bill 24-14 and signed into law last year by Gov. Jared Polis — marks more than academic accomplishment. It signifies that these young people have taken bold, hands-on steps to understand and address the climate challenges facing their home communities.
In Hayden, one student studied drought-resistant crops to preserve his family’s ranching legacy. In Denver, another created a podcast exploring the mental health impacts of climate change. In Boulder, a graduate who lost her home in the Marshall Fire focused her senior project on building climate resilience in the wake of disaster.

In the coming school year, more Colorado districts and charter networks should adopt the Seal of Climate Literacy. This would expand opportunities for students to lead on climate in ways that are practical, empowering, and responsive to their communities. 
As CEO of a Colorado-based nonprofit focused on climate literacy and education pathways, I’ve watched countless programs come and go. But what’s emerging here is more than a promising initiative. It’s a movement that reflects what education can and should be: relevant, student-driven and connected to the real world.
The Seal of Climate Literacy gives students the opportunity to explore local climate issues — from water conservation and wildfire risk to air quality and biodiversity — and take informed, community-based action. They’re planting trees, testing soil, restoring ecosystems, educating peers and partnering with community leaders. They’re not just learning about climate change. They’re responding to it.
That kind of agency matters — especially now. A recent report from the American Psychological Association found that 85% of young people aged 16 to 25 are moderately or extremely worried about climate change. That worry can weigh heavily. But when students have the tools to turn concern into contribution, they gain more than knowledge. They gain direction, confidence and hope.
It’s no surprise, then, that the Seal is spreading quickly. In the 2023-24 school year, 16 students earned it. This spring, over 430 did — and across a broad swath of the state. Notably, that growth isn’t confined to one region or political leaning. From rural mountain towns to urban corridors, students are protecting their communities, honoring their heritage, and preparing for the future.
This common ground is what gives the Seal its quiet power. While climate change often surfaces as a polarizing topic in national discourse, young people in Colorado are proving that it doesn’t have to be. Their work reflects personal stakes, not political ones. They are forging a path forward that is practical, hopeful, and grounded in mutual responsibility.
The Seal is also preparing students for Colorado’s green economy. As sectors like renewable energy, water management, sustainable construction, and regenerative agriculture expand, so too does the need for a workforce that understands the complex relationship between climate and community. Students completing Seal projects are gaining experience, building networks, and exploring careers in real time.
Even better, the program is accessible. Schools don’t need to invest in costly new curricula or infrastructure. The Seal is designed to be low-cost, adaptable, and easy to integrate into existing coursework and partnerships. What’s required is simply the willingness to trust students, support their curiosity, and celebrate their contributions. 
These contributions are already shaping communities. One student helped reconnect her Navajo community with traditional ecological practices. Another worked with local government to increase wildfire preparedness in her neighborhood. These aren’t abstract ideas. They’re lived responses to lived realities.
As a new school year dawns, the momentum behind the Seal of Climate Literacy is undeniable — and too important to leave behind. More Colorado districts and charter networks should adopt the Seal and give students the opportunity to lead on climate in ways that are meaningful, practical, and tied to their communities.
At a time with many cuts to public education, this initiative is a way to offer students and educators something important to them. This doesn’t require major new spending or policy shifts, only a commitment to trust students, elevate local knowledge, and support the future they’re already working to build.
To educators, school leaders, and policymakers: Learn more. Reach out. Join the growing number of communities making the Seal part of their vision for student success.
That Boulder graduate who turned loss into leadership? She’s not the exception — she’s the example. Colorado has shown what’s possible. Let’s keep building on it.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ended broad emergency authorizations for COVID vaccines in recent weeks, which had allowed people to be able to walk into pharmacies without prescriptions to get their shots. Now, people need a prescription from their doctors or must be 65 and older. It is posing challenges for a range of Virginians, insured and uninsured. 
The prescription barrier has already proven to be a delay for a Northern Virginia woman who travels for work and is a cancer survivor. 
Laura Packard, a small business owner and health care activist based in Alexandria, called the shifts “such a mess.” 
When getting her annual flu shot last week she asked about a COVID booster shot, but was told she needed a prescription to get it. As she is traveling for work currently, she’s already contacted her doctor and her insurance company to determine when she can get the vaccine. 
“It shouldn’t be this hard,” she said in an email. “I’m a cancer survivor and medically vulnerable.”
Meanwhile, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet later this month to discuss guidance for doctors, insurance companies and states on how shots can be accessed. While ACIP plans to deliberate the future landscape of vaccines, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed critics of coronavirus vaccines to the committee, which could signal that the shots may be less accessible, more broadly. 
University of Virginia nursing professor Ashley Apple is noting the variety of barriers people can experience, or are already experiencing. 
One limitation for people may be costs. Insurance companies typically cover vaccines that are recommended by the CDC — a notion that is uncertain, pending the upcoming ACIP meeting. For those with insurance, their shots might be covered or partially-covered. Out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus vaccines can range in hundreds of dollars. CVS, for instance, charges $224.99. 
“While one barrier might not seem like a big deal for one population, it is for others,” Apple said.
Another is the ability to access a primary care provider and obtain a prescription in the first place. 
Around Virginia, about 3.8 million people lack a primary care provider nearby, according to a recent Virginia Commonwealth University study. 
Last week, two primary care facilities and an urgent care facility operating under Augusta Health announced their closures in Shenandoah Valley. While some of those patients need to travel only about 10 minutes away to other clinics, others will have to go farther, and face an additional barrier to their health care.
Overall, Apple said she anticipates “bottlenecks” in primary care because people will call in asking for prescriptions while others who didn’t have a provider previously will be making appointments as well, in order to establish their provider and get a prescription. 
For a quick fix, she posited that Virginia’s Department of Health could issue a standing order that could resolve the prescription requirement for Virginians in the interim. 
When The Mercury reached out to VDH on Tuesday inquiring about the idea, VDH epidemiology spokesman Logan Anderson said that he couldn’t answer the question yet. 
Governors in Minnesota and New York have recently issued orders directing standing orders for the COVID-19 vaccine. This offers flexibility for health care providers and pharmacists to provide the vaccine. 
The Mercury also asked if Gov. Glenn Youngkin was considering issuing an order but did not hear back from his spokesperson by the time of this publication. 
VDH’s local health districts in the state played a role when it came to vaccine rollout four years ago, a year into the pandemic, as the nation began to crack down on the global health emergency. 
Though the World Health Organization formally ended the pandemic classification in 2023, it has remained a key focus of prevention efforts through vaccinations. Last week, nearly 4,000 Virginians tested positive for COVID-19. As colder months approach and people are more likely to gather inside, airborne spread illnesses typically experience upticks.

She made the announcement in a video release.

With the exit of Josh Weil from the race earlier this summer, the 38-year-old Jenkins is now the biggest name in Florida Democratic politics to enter the race. She acknowledges that with Florida’s lean to the political right in recent years, she would be an underdog against Moody, but says her upset victory in a race for school board in 2020 in Brevard is proof that she has the stuff to win statewide.
“I live in a deep red county and I ran as an outed Democrat against a really well-known Republican incumbent,” Jenkins said in a phone interview last week, referring to Tina Descovich, who went on to co-found Moms for Liberty, the conservative parental rights organization.
“It was a nonpartisan race, but that’s not how the race was won by any means,” Jenkins added.
“One of the only strategies that my opponent had was to make sure that everyone knew that I was a registered Democrat and I still managed in a year that Donald Trump won [in the county] by 17 points to defeat her by nearly 10 points. And I did that just by being true to who I am. By being an honest educator, being passionate about what I was advocating for. Being a mom. And I just reject the idea that isn’t possible across the state. Because if I can do it in deep red Brevard County, it can be done in other areas.”
Democratic disadvantage
Florida Democratic Senate candidates have not been competitive against GOP incumbent in recent years. Marco Rubio defeated Val Demings by more than 16 points in 2022, and Rick Scott defeated Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by 13 points in 2024.
Jenkins is aware that Democrats now have a 10-point registration gap with Republicans in the state but believes the fact that she hails from a conservative part of the state can boost her candidacy.
“I think it’s time that we had a Democratic statewide candidate who may not come from the traditional blue areas that we typically see, who understands what’s it like to talk directly to community members who may not be the same party registration and listen to their concerns and speak to those concerns and start to rebuild that trust and honest communication with them,” she said.
“Understand that there’s going to be somebody who’s really fighting for them and for their community and for their kids. And so we need to expand that coalition. We can’t just focus on our base, but we need to energize our base. We need to win back those independents, and we have to reach Republicans who are sick and tired of chaos and distractions.”
Susan MacManus via Twitter
Dr. Susan MacManus, professor emerita at the University of South Florida, agrees Jenkins definitely will be an underdog against Moody. “She’s got a steep hill to climb,” she said. “Her advantages are that she’s a new face and people are looking for new people in politics.”
MacManus added that Jenkins’ experience on the school board and her priorities on education “is definitely an attention-grabbing credential, without question.”
In addition to her single term on the school board from 2020-2024, Jenkins has led a political committee supporting school board members in battleground states called Educated We Stand.
Jenkins has considered running for U.S. Senate for a few years now. She flirted in 2023 with entering the 2024 race against Republican Rick Scott, but opted not to.
School board battles
A native of Staten Island, New York, Jenkins moved with her family to Brevard after her father retired from a career in law enforcement. She graduated from the University of Central Florida and worked for years as a speech pathologist in the Brevard County School District until she opted to run for the school board in 2020.
Jenkins’ tenure on the board took place as school boards across the country were riven with intense battles over face mask mandates, book bans, and treatment of LGBTQ students, especially transgender children.
“Protests in front of my home. The vandalism on my property. Three foot ‘F-U’ letters burned into my lawn. Be followed by private investigators. Slanderous websites,” she recounted in a speech in Tampa in 2023.
She opted against seeking a second term.
“I don’t know what you can throw at me that would shock me or make me waver, quite frankly,” she now says about that time. “I pushed through the loud noise and the hate and the intimidation because it was the right thing to do. And sometimes that’s hard. And it came at a great personal cost to me and my family, but I had to do it anyway. I knew it was the right thing to do.”
Whoever wins the Democratic primary will face Moody, 50, appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to replace Marco Rubio in January. Rubio left the seat he had held since 2010 after Donald Trump picked him for U.S. Secretary of State. While she was elected twice statewide to serve as the state’s attorney general, Jenkins believes Moody remains an unknown quantity to many Floridians.
A ‘dangerous Ashley Moody’

“Honestly, I don’t think most people really know who she is,” Jenkins said. “And that’s dangerous. I think part of this campaign is trying to raise awareness of how dangerous Ashley Moody can be, because she’s just a rubber stamp for Ron DeSantis and for Donald Trump. She’s a career politician just like Rick Scott. They take their marching orders from insurance industries and special interests and the extremist party leaders, and I think it’s really important for voters to be aware of that.”
In a press release announcing her candidacy, Jenkins said Moody had voted to rip health care away from more than 1 million Floridians when she supported the Trump domestic spending bill, which includes cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. She also criticized her for her recent comments supporting DeSantis’ proposal to end vaccine mandates.
MacManus noted that Jenkins is less well known than Moody, however, and that’s where she’ll need financial support from Democratic groups outside Florida that have dramatically reduced sending such resources in the past two election cycles.
The Moody campaign did not respond to request for comment.
Other Democrats who have filed to run for the office include Tamika Lyles, Alex Gould, and Paul Ron Cruz. The primary election takes place on Aug. 18, 2026.

The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence is helping to cobble together a set of bills named after Marisol Fuentes-Huaracha, Amanda Grady Sexton, director of public affairs at the coalition, told a roundtable of state officials last week. Fuentes-Huaracha was killed in July by her ex-husband, Michael Gleason, outside the restaurant where she worked, police say.
The goals of the bills: “strengthening statutory protections for victims of domestic and sexual violence, enhancing judicial education, and deepening communication within the courts and between branches of state government,” Sexton said in a statement Tuesday.
Sexton did not provide further details about the content of the bills, which she says the coalition is helping craft with prosecutors, law enforcement, and legislators in both parties. 
“To accomplish this, the Coalition is partnering with Marisol’s loved ones, survivors of abuse, and key stakeholders who serve victims of crime — all with the shared goal of reducing violence in the Granite State,” she said. 
But the promised legislation is one of several proposals for reform in the wake of the Fuentes-Huaracha case that could affect lawmakers’ work. Public officials and lawmakers, many of them Republicans, say the tragedy should be an impetus to improve transparency and accountability in the courts. And some say the bail laws themselves — which were strengthened this year at the urging of Gov. Kelly Ayotte — should be tightened more.
Democrats are more wary. Many had already opposed the stricter bail law, which takes effect Sept. 21, arguing it will deprive defendants of rights.
The new law will repeal the fledgling magistrate system and require that people charged with a serious offense be held behind bars before their arraignment in court. Most significantly, it will lower the standard of proof by which a judge must determine the dangerousness of a defendant in order to deny the defendant bail. Currently, that standard is “clear and convincing evidence”; on Sept. 21, it will be reduced to “probable cause.”
A  2018 effort to advance “statutory protections for victims of domestic and sexual violence” failed to advance in the New Hampshire Legislature after civil rights groups, including the Americans Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, argued it would detract from the rights of defendants.
But those urging further legislative changes are pointing to a litany of failed opportunities listed in a review of the Fuentes-Huaracha case by the judicial branch in a report released late last month. 
“What I’m seeing, and continue to hear, is the issue of discretion being abused in terms of bail decision-making at the court level,” said Executive Councilor John Stephen, a Manchester Republican, in an interview Tuesday.
Asked about any future changes to the bail laws, Ayotte said this year’s legislative fix should be sufficient to change courts’ behavior.
“I was proud to sign a bipartisan law this year to end the failed bail reform social experiment and shut the revolving door for violent criminals in our state,” Ayotte said in a statement Tuesday. “When that law takes effect this month, we will be able to keep violent offenders off our streets and stop preventable tragedies like the murder of Marisol Fuentes in Berlin. I will continue to work every day to protect victims and hold criminals accountable so we can keep New Hampshire the safest state in the nation.”
Calls for accountability
From the coalition’s perspective, the Fuentes-Huaracha case exposed a number of flaws in the judicial system that should be addressed through legislation.
The number of trainings conducted by the judicial branch to inform judges about the signs of abuse and coercion against victims of domestic violence should increase, they say, especially ones to help judges know the signs of abuse when determining whether to issue a protective order or grant bail to a defendant. 
The information on an arrested person, including past arrests and any stalking or domestic violence protective orders they may be subjected to, should be more easily available to law enforcement issues, the coalition says.
And the coalition has said that the statutory definition of abuse in New Hampshire, which hinges on a victim’s “fear for his or her safety or well-being,” should apply to situations of emotional coercion, not just physical danger. 
Stephen has his own wishlist of changes. Since the murder, Stephen and fellow Executive Councilor Joe Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, have conducted a series of forums and listening sessions across the state designed to bring law enforcement and judicial officers together to discuss lessons and solutions.
Stephen, a former homicide prosecutor and assistant attorney general, has arrived at a clear takeaway: The public needs more information about how judges make bail decisions. Speaking Tuesday, he said there is not enough information for people to know how often individual judges are granting bail — and whether there are patterns of leniency.
Stephen also agreed with the coalition about the need for better systems to share information among actors within the system.
But he has stopped short of calling for the bail statute itself to be changed. The changes put in place by this year’s bail reform rollback bill, House Bill 592, should be enough to ensure more people are held that should be held, Stephen argued — particularly with the lowered standard for dangerousness. The key next step, he said, is accountability. 
“I agree wholeheartedly with the governor that we have addressed the significant issue here,” Stephen said. 
“… I do believe, with the probable cause standard in meeting those offenses, that those dangerous criminals will be taken off the road,” he said. “But again, I want to be assured of that.”
An unfinished debate
While Stephen is content to let this year’s bail changes play out, other Republican lawmakers support tightening them further.
Rep. Douglas Trottier, a Belmont Republican, said he would support a bill that would further tie judges’ hands when it comes to setting bail for people repeatedly charged with the same crime.
“One time can be a mistake or a poor judgment for whatever reason, but people that make mistakes, in my opinion, learn from their mistakes,” he said. “If you keep doing it, it’s not a mistake. So we need to hold these people without bail on preventative detention.”
Trottier said he would wait to see how the latest bail reform clawback succeeds, but that he thinks it will likely not be enough. 
Rep. Mike Bordes, a Laconia Republican, also said more legislation to prevent a “revolving door” is necessary. “I think where we started was excellent,” he said Tuesday. “I think it was a step in the right direction. But I do think we do need some more reforms put in place.”
But neither Trottier nor Bordes said they are aware of any specific plans for legislation next year to do so. 
House lawmakers may begin filing bill requests Monday. The final text of any bills is generally not available until early January. 
Democrats, meanwhile, are opposing further changes. Many point to falling crime rates in the state, and raise the risk that stricter bail will mean people will be stuck behind bars for no reason before their trials. 
Rep. David Meuse, a Portsmouth Democrat and a longstanding member of the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, declined to comment directly on the potential victims rights legislation until he had seen a copy. 
But in an interview Tuesday, he said he would be skeptical of any further changes to the bail statute. 
“One of the things that does concern me is we have seen a trend, especially over the last couple of years, to take more and more discretion out of the hands of judges,” he said. “We put judges in that position for a reason.”
The new standard by which judges must establish a defendant’s dangerousness for the purpose of determining bail — “probable cause” — is already very low, Meuse said.
Meuse said he supports increasing information-sharing between police departments and courts so that law enforcement and prosecutors have up-to-date information about a defendant’s arrest and bail history. 
He is more cautious about any efforts to increase accountability of judges, though.
“I don’t want us to get into a situation where every time a judge doesn’t happen to make the right call and can’t predict the future like in (the 2002 film) ‘Minority Report,’ that somehow they’re being censured or disciplined or being threatened with impeachment by the Legislature,” he said. “I think accountability is fine, but let’s see what that looks like.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gavelbiglaw-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 05:56:17.068849

The proposal is Democrats attempt to change the maps to a more even Republican-Democratic split in the state. (Photo by Susan Tebben/OCJ)Ohio Democratic lawmakers have introduced their preferred congressional redistricting plan, which they say creates more competitive districts across the state.
In a press conference on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, flanked by several other state Democrats, presented their plan, which reduces the current Republican majority, but still leaves Democrats in the minority.
“What we have proposed follows the law and gives voters the voice they deserve in their congressional representation,” Isaacsohn said.
The congressional map proposed by Ohio legislative Democrats at a Tuesday press conference.
The congressional redraw is required of Ohio this year, because of a lack of bipartisan agreement on the last map, adopted in March 2022.
Both congressional maps previously adopted by the legislature were also struck down as unconstitutionally partisan by the Ohio Supreme Court, though the most recent map stayed in place despite the court ruling.
Right now, Republicans control 10 out of 15 of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional seats, or 66% of the seats. In 2024, Ohioans supported Donald Trump with 55% of the vote.
In the Democrat’s newest map proposal, the districts would have a breakdown of eight Republican and seven Democratic seats, in what Antonio called “the fairest redistricting proposal that either party has put forward.”
That breakdown would leave Republicans with control of 53% of seats compared to 47% for Democrats.
The Ohio General Assembly has until the end of the month to come up with a congressional redistricting plan that must receive 66% approval in both chambers of the legislature.
In order to be approved, the plan must have the support of half the Democrats in the Ohio House and Senate.
If the legislature can’t come to the bipartisan agreement they need by the end of the month, the Ohio Redistricting Commission will be reactivated. The commission has until the end of October to come to bipartisan agreement.
If they reach a stalemate, the process moves back to the legislature, who can then pass maps with a simple majority. Without bipartisan agreement, the legislature will have to redraw the maps again in another four years.

Democratic leaders have already pledged to act as a united front when it comes to pushing the Republican supermajority for maps that are fair to both parties, and maps that align with the voting trends of the state. Those voting trends lean Republican at 55%-44% in an average of statewide elections over the past 10 years.
The Senate leader said the new proposal has seven seats that “lean slightly to the left” and the other eight seats “lean toward the right.”
The biggest Republican majority in the proposed map is District 4 in Northwest Ohio, which would have a 75% Republican majority. District 2 in Southwest Ohio would have a 70% Republican majority.
On the other side of the aisle, the most Democratic district would be District 11, which includes Cleveland, with a 74% Democratic majority. District 3, which includes southern Franklin County would have a 64% Democratic majority.
“This map does not unduly favor or disfavor any party or incumbent,” Antonio said. “Those are the rules.”
Antonio and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn said they are open to working together with Republicans, but put their map up in an effort to get the process started, when Republicans have not made moves to introduce a map or start the public hearing process for congressional redistricting.

“If our colleagues, the Republicans, are committed to bipartisanship, then they must join in the urgency and pass a fair, constitutional plan by the end of the month,” Antonio said.
Antonio and Isaacsohn have previously said they are anticipating “another opportunity to gerrymander the districts” from Republicans.
Ohio’s Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has made comments hoping Republicans would give an 80% Republican lean to congressional districts in the state, taking 12 of 15 seats. Moreno won his seat in 2024 with just slightly over 50% of the vote.
At Tuesday’s press conference, Antonio said state Democrats have been in contact with congressional Democrats, but only to talk about the process, not to ask about district preferences.
But Democratic leaders are remaining positive despite the Republican supermajority that could run out the clock on the process.
Ohio’s legislative Republicans not only have a majority in both chambers of the legislature, but they also have a majority in the Ohio Redistricting Commission should the process come to that.
Even if Democrats in the state wanted to take a play out of Texas Democrats’ playbooks and leave the state, Republicans would still have a quorum on the commission.
“If you don’t act, if you don’t propose change, then you have no possibility of ever seeing any kind of change, any kind of progress,” Antonio said.
As the legislature considers their own proposals, the public has the ability to submit their own maps for consideration, which many citizens have already done.
While the Democrats initial plan did not take into account the public proposals already submitted, Antonio said they are “going to consider everything.”
Asked for comment on the Democrat map, the press secretary for the House Majority caucus said “given the process is still in its early stages, the Ohio House Majority will not be commenting on any specific maps at this time.”
A spokesperson for the Ohio Senate Majority did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Jose Carlos Cerdeno Martinez/Getty Images)There are a lot of confusing statistics about health insurance, health care costs, access to care, and other features of our complex health care system circulating around right now. 
Unfortunately, the actual health of our country’s people and communities is often lost among these mostly financial metrics. One of this column’s authors, Don Kollisch, is a doctor who has practiced family medicine in New Hampshire for more than 40 years. He has worked at medical schools and Veterans Affairs (more commonly known as just “the VA”), but his clinical heart is in the rural North Country of our state, where he worked for many years.
Dr. Kollisch was a believer in prevention and worked hard to control the blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol of his patients. One day, covering the ER of his small critical-access hospital, he admitted a man in his 60s who had a stroke that was most likely caused by untreated high blood pressure. The patient lost some speech and some of the use of his right arm and leg. Dr. Kollisch realized, with dismay, that the man lived in a small house near Dr. Kollisch’s own clinic, which he ran 8 miles up the road. The man never came in for treatment of his blood pressure because he worked for a small company and didn’t have health insurance. Food and electricity had to be higher priorities. 
If Dr. Kollisch had any doubts previously about the need for everyone in his community to have health insurance, they were permanently dispelled. He became an advocate for expanding publicly funded health insurance to cover everyone, and he is dismayed that current political trends are moving in the opposite direction, toward people losing rather than gaining insurance coverage.
Congress passed and on July 4 President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the largest ever cut to government health care funding in U.S. history. The Congressional Budget Office projects Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will push about 10 million Americans off of health insurance while growing the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. When combined with the looming expiration of enhanced subsidies for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (more commonly known as “Obamacare”), that uninsurance figure rises to 14.2 million Americans, according to nonpartisan health policy news and analysis organization KFF.
Health economists like author Thomas Lane have studied the link between health insurance and health outcomes. Their work allows us to estimate how many more preventable deaths may occur as health insurance coverage declines, among other outcomes. For example, in a study called the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a lottery was run for people on a waiting list to join Medicaid, and the outcomes of those selected were followed over time and compared to those not selected. By combining the results of studies like these with KFF’s projection of the number of Granite Staters who will lose their health insurance due to the OBBBA and related policy changes, Thomas can project its health impacts.
After doing the math, discomforting results quickly become apparent. New Hampshire can expect to see an extra avoidable death slightly more often than once a week, as well as thousands of other residents cut off from necessary care and medications. Over 5,000 may join the already swollen ranks of those in medical debt.

Make no mistake, however. The craziest part of all of this should not be these figures themselves. It’s the fact that they can mostly still be prevented from coming to fruition by our state Legislature.
KFF estimates that the OBBBA will cost New Hampshire about $230 million per year over the next decade, leaving a big hole for our state legislators to fill. Although some of these harms are caused by Congress’ imposition of work requirements and paperwork burdens on Medicaid beneficiaries that the state cannot do much about, most of the damage comes from the funding cuts. 
Funding cuts are something the state can definitely do something about. It just needs to come up with roughly $230 million on its own.
How exactly can the state find such a large sum of money? Despite the protests of budget hawks, it’s not actually that complicated. Currently, the state runs Medicaid through private third-party administrators, called managed care organizations (MCOs). MCOs are a product of the 1990s, when the public policy world thought the problem with health care was that people were using too much of it, and health care needed gatekeepers. This is an evidence-free claim. Americans actually use less care than people in Europe and Canada despite spending far more per capita, all while living shorter, less healthy lives. If anything, we don’t use enough. Nonetheless, the MCOs still run New Hampshire’s Medicaid program, adding significant administrative expenses onto the state budget while doing nothing to make health care better.
Connecticut got rid of these wasteful MCO contractors in 2012, instead opting to run its Medicaid program itself. Unsurprisingly, they saved lots of money doing so. Nonpartisan health policy research and advocacy organization Physicians for a National Health Program estimates that New Hampshire could save up to $81 million annually from the removal of MCO contracting alone, but changes like this cascade through the Medicaid system and lead to other beneficial effects, too. 
It’s possible to roughly guess what this total effect might look like by simply comparing the difference between what New Hampshire and Connecticut spend on Medicaid per beneficiary. That difference comes out at around $307 million in lower costs annually if New Hampshire’s program had the same costs per beneficiary as Connecticut’s.
That $307 million in potential savings is far more than enough to fill the health care-related $230 million hole in the state budget. With that money, the state can ensure tens of thousands of Granite Staters get the care they need while preventing closures of the countless New Hampshire hospitals and nursing homes that depend on Medicaid for funding.
Other states are starting to consider legislation that would cut out these unnecessary and wasteful Medicaid middlemen. For example, there was a bill in the previous session of the Minnesota legislature called the Patient-Centered Care Act that would more or less copy what Connecticut did (SF1059/HF255). One of us previously wrote a column in support of it, explaining why MCOs are so unhelpful from just about everyone’s perspective, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.
Back then, it was admittedly still uncertain whether Congress would actually pass a massive budget cut package, but it did, and now there are no more excuses. 
Our state Legislature can quite easily alleviate most of the financial problems Congress has passed onto it and thereby save lives. All New Hampshire has to do is copy what Connecticut did and pass a not very big — but in our opinion quite beautiful — bill to cut wasteful MCO middlemen out of our Medicaid program.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/doctorcomp-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 05:56:17.068849

Attorneys representing several Ohio officials including Republican state Treasurer Robert Sprague want a judge to dismiss the class action lawsuit challenging the use of unclaimed funds to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium.
In a pair of filings, they reject the lawsuit as a “misguided challenge” and the plaintiffs’ objections as “conspiratorial ramblings.”
Far from coming up with some novel workaround to take ordinary Ohioans’ money, “the law is both mundane and entirely within the state’s prerogative,” the state’s attorneys argue. “The state’s right to manage, dispose of, and take title to abandoned property has been established for hundreds of years.”
If the plaintiffs are so worried about the state taking their property, one filing repeatedly asks, why don’t they just claim it?
The state’s lawyers have filed a motion to break up the class of plaintiffs and another to dismiss the case outright.

Background
The case centers on the most recent state budget. The Cleveland Browns were seeking $600 million in state dollars to help to pay for a new $2.5 billion stadium in Brook Park. Republican lawmakers came up with a clever plan to pay for it without raising taxes.
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

They could just take the money from ordinary Ohioans.
The state manages a pool of nearly $5 billion in unclaimed funds. That money is made up of forgotten assets — things like old bank accounts, security deposits or insurance policies. It’s a big chunk of what state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, has called “lazy money.” It’s just sitting in an account generating interest, but little else. He argued, why not put some of it to use?
The Ohio Senate’s budget plan moves money that has gone unclaimed for more than 10 years to a new cultural and sports facilities fund. Rightful owners would have 10 more years to come forward, but after that, they’d lose any claim over their money. The Ohio House didn’t object, and when the budget landed on Gov. DeWine’s desk, he didn’t either.
Two attorneys and former Democratic lawmakers, Jeff Crossman and Marc Dann, filed a class action lawsuit claiming the state’s plan amounts to stealing. Looking to eminent domain law, they said the state has to jump through several hoops before taking possession of a citizen’s property, but Ohio officials had done none of that.

In the most recent filings, attorneys representing Ohio’s treasurer, the Department of Commerce director, the Division of Unclaimed Funds superintendent, and the executive director of the state facilities construction commission, pushed back.
“The complaint is nothing more than an expression of plaintiffs’ belief that the law makes for bad public policy,” the state’s attorneys said. “Plaintiffs, however, are not entitled to use this lawsuit to substitute their judgment for that of the state’s duly elected representatives.”
Standing & class status
To bring a lawsuit, a plaintiff needs to demonstrate ‘standing’ — that they’ve been harmed, the defendant caused that harm and the court could fix it. In its filings, the state poked holes in class action’s claims of standing. With a website available for people to reclaim property, what harm has occurred? Anyone who believes the state of Ohio has custody of their property can file a claim, right now, to get their property back.
“Plaintiffs here simply ignored (and continue to ignore) the available administrative procedure entirely,” the state’s attorneys write. “By deciding not to file claims under that process, they plan to cause their own injury and lack standing to claim that defendants are at fault.”
What’s more, they questioned whether any injury exists at all, much less the “actual, imminent and concrete injury” plaintiffs need to demonstrate standing. Although state lawmakers set a deadline for claims, that cutoff isn’t until 2036.
“Thus, no matter what, plaintiffs have had, and will have, more than ten years until they could theoretically experience a loss of their property,” the state contends. “That is hardly ‘imminent.’”
The state’s lawyers argue the case is “far too speculative, remote, and abstract” to meet the requirements. Because no property becomes truly unrecoverable until 2036, no actual harm occurs until then either. By extension, the case won’t be “ripe” until then for court review. Because the plaintiffs haven’t taken advantage of the readily available administrative process for reclaiming their property, it’s not necessary for the court to intervene.
In a separate filing, the state’s legal team argued there’s little that binds the supposed class together. People with property in Ohio’s unclaimed funds trust might prompt similar questions, but the state’s attorneys contend the point of a class action is to deliver a singular answer for the entire group.
The state’s attorneys explain the federal government preempts disputes over money from FDIC-protected accounts. And because the state will only take over funds that have been in the trust for ten or more years, not every claimant would fit in the class.
“Given the vast differences within the proposed class,” they insist, “these questions will require individualized answers, which will depend on multiple factors that would require a claimant-by-claimant analysis.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
For 60 years, Head Start has provided child care for the most vulnerable children in the United States with little controversy.
It was established by a Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1965, and supported by a slew of Republicans since, including Richard Nixon, who called it “valuable”; Ronald Reagan, who established Head Start Awareness Month in the 1980s; and George H. W. Bush, who increased its funding. Legislators from both parties have supported Head Start, which operates in all 50 states, and is the only child care option available in some rural parts of the country.
This year, though, politics came to the door of Head Start. Caught in the political crosshairs of the Trump administration, the program is facing unprecedented upheaval that could shutter child care centers and, as many of Head Start experts who spoke to The 19th see it, fundamentally alter the program.
“For me and for a lot of other directors, trust has been deeply broken,” said Jen Bailey, executive director of Reach Dane, which operates 17 child care centers in Wisconsin and offers Head Start services. “The mission is we serve the neediest of the needy and poorest of the poor. For us, changing that would violate the mission of Head Start.”
The program, which now serves about 700,000 children, was created to support low-income families. It provides free child care to children ages 3 to 5 (Early Head Start serves those under 3) and offers a wide array of services for the entire family, including prenatal support, health screenings and connecting parents to job training, housing and food assistance.
But the Trump administration has dealt several financial blows to the program this year. At one point, it looked like Head Start may be eliminated completely.
And more recently, the future of Head Start has been thrown into uncertainty by an unprecedented directive from the administration: Programs are to ban undocumented children from Head Start entirely.
Attorneys general in 21 Democratic-led states have sued the federal government over this rule, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has agreed to halt enforcement in those states until September 11. As programs wait for additional guidance on whether they will have to implement that change, the mood is one of unease, confusion and fear, according to interviews with nearly two dozen Head Start experts across the country, including providers, state association directors and federal workers.
There’s a discomfort over just how much the politics of the moment has reached their programs. They don’t want to say anything that could turn D.C.’s attention on them.
At the same time, they are trying to continue to serve Head Start families, knowing that soon, some of them could be barred from it. Because the work they do is so deeply connected with the populations the Trump administration is targeting, they are now weighing a moral dilemma: If Head Start changed, could they stay?
“We would have staff say, ‘I don’t want to work in a program that has this eligibility criteria.’ And I would understand that,” Bailey said.
Already, her centers are seeing dips in attendance from families who are afraid they will get caught in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid as they bring their kids in. About 70,000 undocumented people live in Wisconsin, according to the Migration Policy Institute; Reach Dane’s centers serve some 1,000 children.
Bailey told her staff that although the political rhetoric has changed, their core values have not. Reach Dane is not making any changes until more guidance arrives from Washington. But if they were forced to check for immigration status, she’s not sure she could stay.
“If it came to the point where it could not take care of staff and kids and families at some sort of basic level, I wouldn’t be able to ethically sit in that space,” said Bailey, who has worked in Head Start for 25 years.

Project 2025, the 900-page document from the conservative Heritage Foundation that has turned into a policy blueprint for President Donald Trump’s second term, dedicates one paragraph to Head Start. Citing “rampant abuse” of children and “lack of positive outcomes,” advising: Eliminate Head Start.
While there have been documented cases of abuse and neglect at Head Start programs, it still has one of the most rigorous safety standards in American child care (the incidents affected fewer than 1 in 1,000 children, according to the Administration for Children and Families, the division that oversees Head Start), and the issues are not unique to Head Start. Numerous studies have also found positive outcomes both in the short and long term for children enrolled in the program.
In April, a leaked White House budget showed the Trump administration was angling to eliminate Head Start altogether, claiming it used a “radical” curriculum that gave preference to undocumented children and embraced diversity, equity and inclusion. In response, the National Head Start Association sent an open letter to the president signed by 50,000 Head Start parents and alumni.
The letter-writing campaign would grow to number nearly 500,000, and state Head Start associations also mobilized to speak out against the program’s elimination. Ultimately, it worked. Head Start received flat funding from Congress — what amounts to a budget cut when accounting for inflation.
Still, the programs have taken economic hits — in some cases, ones they could barely recover from. Shortly after Trump took office at the end of January, funding to programs was cut off as part of a government-wide freeze. At least 45 programs serving nearly 20,000 children across 23 states spent days and weeks waiting for money to come down. The true number is likely much higher, experts said.
April Mullins-Datko, the Head Start director at ADVOCAP, a community action agency in Wisconsin that provides Head Start services, said her funding was delayed for more than a month. They used some reserve funds and took out a line credit to stay open.
“We were limping. Robbing Peter and paying Paul,” said Mullins-Datko, a 20-year Head Start veteran who was a Head Start child herself in the 1980s. Her twins also went through the program.
A Government Accountability Office report released in July found that the Trump administration violated federal law when it withheld funds from programs that had already been approved by Congress. Between January 20 and April 15, Head Start grantees received $825 million less in funding when compared to the same period in 2024.
Another headwind arrived in April. Five of the 10 regional offices that support Head Start and other child care programs suddenly closed as part of a reduction of the federal workforce. All were in blue states. Programs in 22 states lost specialists who helped them navigate challenges with funding, who served as the first points of contact if a safety incident occurred. The remaining offices, which were already shortstaffed, took on entire states’ caseloads.
Katie Hamm, who oversaw the Head Start program in her role as the deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development for the Biden administration, called it “a game of whack-a-mole, where you think you solved a new issue and here comes another one.” Hamm left the role in January 2025.
But what has really rattled Head Start is the change on immigration. Since the new guidance on undocumented children was issued in July, programs have been in something of a holding pattern.
Fundamentally, the guidance redefines Head Start and other HHS programs as a “federal public benefit,” or in other words, welfare. Head Start has never been defined as a form of welfare, said Allison Siebeneck, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, one of the groups suing the federal government over the changes to Head Start. Welfare reform in the 1990s specifically excluded K-12 and early childhood from the definition of a “federal public benefit,” she said: “They could have included it, and they didn’t.”
Redefining Head Start means only U.S. citizens or “qualified aliens” can access the program, excluding undocumented children but also those who are seeking asylum, those with U visas such as victims of serious crimes, those with temporary protected status and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
When the Trump administration published its rule change, it argued that undocumented immigrants “should not burden” our benefits system. The change was effective immediately.
The new rules came with no additional information on how programs are to screen families. Programs are still waiting for implementation guidance from the federal Office of Head Start. Thousands of teachers, parents and Head Start alumni, meanwhile, have submitted comments in the federal registrar responding to the change, many of them condemning it.
The rule change does include an exemption for nonprofits that offer Head Start services, which is about 70 percent of all programs, but the administration noted that all programs, regardless of the exemption, are encouraged to “pay heed to the clear expressions of national policy” and screen students for immigration status. Siebeneck called it a “thinly veiled threat.”
“You have one statute that says you’re exempt,” she said, “but when you go to sign for your grant you also have to sign a certification saying you’re in compliance with federal law.”
Program directors, who already saw what it was like to suddenly lose funding earlier in the year, are now afraid to lose their grants altogether if they don’t comply with the requirement. Some may comply before exact guidance is released or regardless of nonprofit status.
In Illinois, Lauri Morrison-Frichtl, executive director of the Illinois Head Start Association, said one Head Start director has decided not to enroll children if they find out the family is undocumented.
“They don’t want to do something that gets them in trouble. Our programs follow the rules,” Morrison-Frichtl said. “They are not rule breakers.”

“It’s an odd moment that what we’ve always been doing has now turned into the politics of the moment,” reflected Mullins-Datko, the Head Start program director in Wisconsin. “We can usually find common ground with our children no matter what our politics are because typically we all want the same things for our children: We want them to thrive, we want them to be healthy, we want them to get a good education — that’s why Head Start has enjoyed bipartisan support throughout its history.”
Many Head Start providers would love to return to a time when Head Start wasn’t political, when their primary concern was how to better serve the families and children in their care with the resources they had. Others feel like the mission of Head Start — to protect those most in need — has moved them to speak up at a time when those communities are being targeted.
“Head Start has been around for 11 administrations and 60 years and have never seen these types of asks of us changing our approach to eligibility and enrollment, despite Congress having a lot of opportunities to do that,” said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association.
The national group is in touch with members across both sides of the aisle who support Head Start. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Sheridan said, has expressed support for the program, saying in May that he would “be very sad” if programs shut their doors and adding that he “fought very hard to make sure Head Start gets all of its funding next year.” Nevertheless, the changes to Head Start have taken place under Kennedy’s leadership at HHS.
It’s now a matter of, “How do we move Head Start out of the way of politics?” Sheridan said.
In Indiana, Rhett Cecil, the head of the state’s Head Start Association, is also trying to keep the conversation nonpartisan.
“There’s no agenda in Head Start,” he said.“I find it remarkably refreshing in a polarized society.”
Cecil is waiting for guidance on implementing the immigration change from the federal Office of Head Start, but said it’s not something his members have thought through much yet. “Our programs will adhere to the standards of Head Start,” he said. About 100,000 undocumented immigrants live in Indiana, putting it in the middle of the pack among states in terms of population.
“Here’s what’s changed in Indiana,” Cecil said: “Nothing.”
Megan Woller, the executive director of the Idaho Head Start Association, said providers in her state are worried about scaring families away and bringing too much attention to Head Start.
“Idaho is a political climate that is right in line with the Trump administration. My state association colleagues across the country who all live in different political climates are advocating in very vocal ways and are banding together,” Woller said. “My members have not wanted to do that. There is a fear of being too vocal and causing a big stink and putting too much focus on Head Start.”
But in other parts of the country, programs have been moved to speak up. Four Head Start state associations and two parent organizations are named plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump administration. All are blue or purple states — Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Oregon and California.
In more conservative states, few programs and Head Start Associations were willing to speak to The 19th about this year’s changes. But for some in red states the immigration directive feels like a step too far.
Julie Stone, who leads the Ohio Head Start Association, said the immigration change represents a fundamental shift for programs.
“We are about meeting families where they are. We are about doing what’s right for children,” Stone said. “We’ve never been required to establish their status, but we know their parents are working and we know we have them in a safe and nourishing environment.”
And ICE enforcement is only ramping up. The agency’s annual budget is set to triple. That makes her anxious, “knowing there will be more enforcement and we are somehow … getting wrapped up in this,” Stone said.
Multiple programs and state Head Start agencies told The 19th that the political rhetoric around immigration is distorting the reality of who the families who rely on Head Start are, what they contribute to their communities and why the program is needed.
“What I know to be true about Head Start: The majority of [the families] go to work,” said Jennie Mauer, the head of the Wisconsin Head Start Association. Many of those undocumented families in her state work in the dairy industry, which relies on migrant workers to operate. Those workers, an estimated 70 percent of the dairy workforce, need somewhere to put their children.
Otherwise, how will the Dairy State continue to be the Dairy State?
“We can have all that [political] rhetoric, but I want safe communities and I want safe children,” Mauer said. “I do not believe that coming to Head Start and putting these questions to families who are just trying to go to work is the way to do it.”

In Detroit, this year of upheaval has already led to the closure of a Head Start program, leaving 324 children without child care.
The center, called Focus: HOPE, had been receiving Head Start funding as part of a consortium of three programs. Last year, the consortium disbanded and each program applied individually. CEO Portia Roberson said her program tried to put together a grant application that aligned with the priorities of the new administration, noting that it served “all” children.
They were supposed to hear back about their grant in March, but nothing came. Michigan was one of the states that lost its regional office in April, meaning the staff that ensured grants were evenly spaced so communities didn’t lose Head Start services were gone.
By July 31, still not having heard anything, the money ran dry. Focus: HOPE laid off nearly 100 staff members and announced the closure of their Head Start services. Roberson expected parents to be angry with her. But instead, she said, “they were here to figure out how they could support what we are doing and to let people know how important we are for their families.”
In mid-August, the program learned its grant application had been denied. No explanation was given at first — they later learned that one of the providers in the consortium, Starfish Family Services, had received the funding Focus: HOPE expected to go to them.
“The current administration talks about wanting to build a workforce. My question is how do parents become a part of this workforce if there is no safe and educational place to put their children?” she said. Now, “I’m taking people out of the workforce.”
Roberson is hoping Starfish will take them back in as a subgrantee, which will allow her to service the families in their care. If that happens, she will then have to consider what those services would look like with the new immigration changes.
“What gets lost in all of this is we are just trying to help people who need help. We are not making decisions around race or class or political party,” she said. “
She doesn’t know how she could enforce the immigration directive. If it came down to protecting children from being removed, Roberson said, Focus: HOPE would do “whatever needs to be done.”

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)At her first campaign event focused on affordable housing, Democratic candidate Hannah Pingree said making it accessible to more Mainers needs to be a top issue for whoever becomes the state’s next governor. 
Joined by municipal and state housing leaders at the Bangor Public Library Tuesday, the former head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future (GOPIF) and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives highlighted the progress Maine has already made, but said “there is a lot more work to be done.”
“I think it’s important that the next governor make this the top issue,” Pingree said. The event was held at the close of the MaineHousing Affordable Housing conference and launched Pingree’s statewide housing tour. Pingree will be holding events over the next few months to bring together various stakeholders — from renters to developers — to work on solutions to the state’s housing challenges.
Earlier that day, Mills gave the opening remarks at the conference, during which she highlighted Pingree’s work. As head of GOPIF, Pingree authorized nearly $315 million to support the construction of new affordable homes across the state, which Mills said was “nearly five times more than the total amount spent on housing from 2000 to 2018.”
Pingree said while working for the Mills administration, which she joined in 2019, she realized that “housing was this fundamental challenge that was starting to impact Maine, and it was impacting every part of our economy, every part of every community across the state.”
“We’ve made some progress. We’ve done some good work on housing, but we need to double the space or triple the space to meet the demand,” she added.
Despite increasing construction, Maine still needs 84,000 new affordable housing units while 5,000 children remain unhoused, Pingree said.
The housing tour presents the first major campaign events for Pingree, who is among a crowded field of candidates for the Democratic nomination to replace Mills, who terms out next year. Though the governor has yet not officially endorsed anyone in the June 6 primary race, which includes Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and former Senate President Troy Jackson, among others, Pingree is seen as Mills’ chosen successor. 
During the event, Pingree asked panelists to share what they view as the most pressing housing challenges, possible municipal solutions as well as what the next governor should do to address homelessness and the lack of housing.
Rep. Traci Gere (D-Kennebunkport), who chairs the Housing and Economic Development Committee, and Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) highlighted the increasing homelessness in many Maine communities. 
Bangor officials pointed to local initiatives that will help alleviate homelessness in the city, including the newly opened Theresa’s Place, a refurbished building project by the nonprofit Penquis that added 41 subsidized studio and one-bedroom apartments for low income residents. 
Pingree said the goal of the tour is to listen and learn about what people believe the next governor should do to address Maine’s housing shortage.
The next stops include Biddeford on Sept. 16, Portland on Sept. 26, Auburn on Sept. 29, Berwick on Oct. 2, Dover-Foxcroft on Oct. 6, Ellsworth on Oct. 10, and Rockland on Oct. 14, with additional stops to be announced.

Roger Marshall of Kansas describes, with signage, the number of vaccines he claims U.S. children typically receive by the age of 18 during a Sept. 4, 2025, hearing of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate Finance Committee video)On Sunday, Roger Marshall had his coming-out party on national television as an anti-vaccine crank.
Of course the Republican U.S. senator from Kansas denies that he’s anything of the sort, but his lengthy interview on Face the Nation should appall anyone who cares about public health. He told host Margaret Brennan that certain vaccines weren’t needed in certain cases, that other vaccines had been overhyped and that everyone just needed to stop worrying so much about COVID-19. Marshall has tossed moms and babies overboard in his eagerness to appease anti-science conspiracy-mongers.
His capitulation to wingnuttery would be hilarious if it wasn’t so deeply dangerous.
But let’s look at the interview. Let’s examine his statements and really think about them. Thankfully, CBS posted a complete transcript, so we can hang on every syllable. Not that I would recommend it.
Marshall: “In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don’t think there’s many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they’re old enough to vote.”
Note the word used here: “Jabs.” That’s an aggressive, painful word. He doesn’t use “inoculations” or even “vaccinations.” No, he says “jabs.”
Why? What’s he trying to convey?
Marshall also emphasizes the number 76. That sounds big and scary and unacceptable, fit for a protest sign. In reality, vaccines are given in multiple doses to maximize immune response. You can see the CDC vaccination chart below; it’s not secret. There are vaccines against 19 illnesses listed, including flu shots and a couple based on individual circumstances.
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
The only reason to use that number is for Marshall to curry favor with folks who reject the astonishing advances of modern science. That would include Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., who apparently rejects the germ theory of disease.
Has Marshall joined the secretary in his skepticism? Has he thrown off the tyranny of germ-focused medicine to focus on battling spirits of illness instead?
But we need to press forward.
Marshall on the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is given to newborns: “If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she’s in a stable, monogamous relationship, she’s not doing IV drugs, she’s not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there’s zero chance that that baby’s going to have Hepatitis. Now, there’s other moms that — or other babies that do need it, OK. We need to be more specific. We can’t be overly prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she’s an IV drug-abuser, if she’s not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well?”
Absolute bull hockey. To respond, I’ll turn to fellow Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. He’s also a physician, and he posted this Twitter thread:
“Not all mothers have prenatal care. Some get infected between testing in the first trimester and delivery. In some cases, the test is overlooked. If a child is infected at birth, they have a 95% chance of becoming chronically infected UNLESS, they get one dose of hepatitis B vaccine. If they do, they have less than a 5% chance of being chronically infected.
“If someone is infected at birth, they have a much higher chance of developing liver cancer and of spreading hepatitis B to others.
“The vaccine is safe as proven by study after study. MAHA starts with preventing vaccine preventable diseases.”
To understand the moral imperative here, we need to step way back. Most illnesses don’t permanently harm people. But most smokers don’t die of lung cancer, either. Vaccines and common health ensure that when exceptions happen, you and your family and loved ones will be protected. If only one person in 1,000 dies from a preventable illness, we still have 330 million people in the United States, and 3 million in Kansas.
Over time, vaccines and good health advice reduce the number of folks unlucky enough to fall ill. That one in 1,000 becomes one in 10,000, or one in a million.
As decades pass, because of the sheer quantity, vast numbers of lives are saved. Children are born to parents who might otherwise have died. Those children have children of their own and so on.
Vaccines are one of the single biggest pro-life inventions of the modern age.
Marshall: “Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to COVID vaccine? Why can’t we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide.”
Well, because of people like you, senator. You chose to embrace the rhetoric and outright grift of snake-oil salesmen rather than support basic public health measures. You even made a fuss about taking hydroxychloroquine to supposedly protect yourself from COVID-19!
What gall to suggest that Americans somehow behave irrationally when they want to protect themselves from the wave of infection that you enabled for the past half-decade?


As I stated at the beginning of this column, Marshall emphatically rejects the suggestion that he opposes vaccines. He tried to eat his cake and have to too by telling Brennan: “Before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I’ve raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.”
He can say that. He may even believe it. I personally believe that Marshall should be ashamed.
I expect he would have problems if random Kansans posted a sign and started calling themselves OB-GYNs. I expect he would protest to medical authorities if those people started delivering babies without education or licensure.
Marshall trained for his job. He worked hard. He knows information and best practices that everyday people don’t. For a quarter-century, he worked as an expert.
Most people are not medical experts, either about delivering babies or vaccination schedules. They aren’t trained about infant and childhood health. They are trying to make it through a challenging world and make the best decisions possible for their families.
The commonly used childhood vaccine schedule does that. It allows doctors and nurses, who are already pressured by the demands of our health care system, to ensure that the greatest number of people receive the greatest benefit from the miracle drugs known as vaccines.
When our son was born, my husband and I were happy to see doctors vaccinate him against Hepatitis B. Not because we thought it likely, but because it put our minds at rest. We were happy to watch him complete the full round of childhood vaccines. Again, not because we thought dire illnesses were circulating, but because we knew they would safeguard his health if worse came to worse
Follow the recommended vaccine schedule. Listen to your doctors. Protect the health of those you love and everyone else.
Marshall has betrayed the babies he delivered and the mothers who turned to him for care. He has sacrificed his decades of experience to worship at the golden calf of RFK Jr. and anti-science charlatans. Our nation and this state will suffer the consequences.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)When politicians feel compelled to fix what ain’t broke their motivations for proposing solutions in search of a problem are probably less than pure. 
Political mischief to muck up what works or put the kibosh on ideas to improve outcomes is a means to self-serving ends. 
Take the slew of voting bills Ohio lawmakers have teed up for passage in the Statehouse. 
None were crafted to encourage greater voter participation. None took pains to eliminate contrived obstacles to voting or to create more access, ease and opportunity to facilitate citizens engagement in their government. 
Nearly every piece of legislation winding its way through the General Assembly would make it harder for Ohioans to vote by adding new layers of unnecessary restrictions, administrative burdens, and preemptive bans to effectively throttle the process and discourage turnout. 
Concocting excessive hurdles that eligible voters must clear before casting a ballot in Ohio means many might not bother. 
Which appears to be the point of several anti-voter bills in the legislature draped in the deceptive cover of “protecting election integrity” or “securing our elections.”  
State legislators who float extreme remedies for imaginary voting issues have to camouflage their disenfranchisement campaign somehow. 
But people are catching on to the endless legislative encroachment of groundless voting barriers in Ohio from one of the most restrictive voter-ID laws in the country to sharply limited drop boxes and shortened windows for voters to fix provisional ballot errors, return vote-by-mail ballots, and vote early in-person.

It is becoming increasingly clear to many Ohioans that political self-preservation, not expanding access to voting or making it easier to register and participate, is what drives policymakers in Ohio to continually curb the voting power of citizens. 
Think about it. If too many Ohioans can too easily jettison extremist politicians who don’t represent their values or vote for citizen-led initiatives that repeal widely opposed legislation, they threaten the politicians who gerrymandered themselves into unaccountable supermajorities in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate. 
The entrenched powerful, who pretty much do as they please with impunity, cannot allow voters to interfere with a good thing, so they erect gratuitous roadblocks to suppress voting in the state.  
Ohio Republican legislators, occasionally joined by equally self-serving Democrats, have been on a tear to impose new impediments to voting since the GOP decided to exploit Donald Trump’s Big Lie — about massive voting fraud rigging the 2020 election — to enact all manner of obstructive voting laws under the guise of “election integrity.”  
It is an insidious ruse to erode voting rights and disenfranchise those unable to jump through arbitrary hoops to exercise those rights.
But the partisan hits keep coming to silence the voices of the poor, the young, the disabled, the elderly. 
Anyone without the means, mobility, or mastery to navigate the stream of unwarranted changes in state election laws can lose the chance to be heard. 
Ohio Senate Bill 153 is one of the more outrageous schemes to affront Ohio voters in the current legislative session.
It would throw an indefensible wrench into voter registration with proof of citizenship requirements to fix the virtually nonexistent problem of noncitizens voting in elections.
The offense, which is already prohibit by state and federal laws and efficiently blocked by vigilant election oversight, is so statistically rare in Ohio that it literally happens zero percent in the state.  
Requiring all Ohioans to provide documentary proof of citizenship whenever they register to vote or change their name or address, in legislation mirroring a GOP congressional measure, could, for no evidence-based justification, keep scores of legally qualified voters who do not have or cannot easily access such documents from voting. 
Yet the co-sponsors of Ohio Senate Bill 153, Bowling Green Republican Theresa Gavarone (a Senate go-to on voter suppression bills) and Andrew Brenner of Delaware plow ahead with their legislation to undermine the power of the vote and citizen initiatives while framing their attacks on voters as “common sense” and a ”simple fix” to ensure “trust and integrity” in the voting system they are gutting.
Senate Bill 63, another Gavarone special that also takes power away from voters was co-sponsored by Columbus Democrat Bill DeMora and, with minimal debate, was passed in the Senate with bipartisan support and sent to the Ohio House. 
It would prohibit ranked choice voting (RCV) — where voters rank multiple candidates on their ballot instead of picking just one — on the state level and punish local municipalities that allow it in their own elections by cutting off government funding. 
Why the rush to preemptively ban voting reform that arguably encourages political moderation, may provide a guardrail against extremism in both parties, gives voters more choices and a more broadly popular winner who appeals to a majority of the electorate? 
Is it because RCV poses a threat to dug in power protected by gerrymandering?
Those safe seats are decided in primaries where partisan extremists often prevail, and Ohio Republicans have just revived efforts to pass a bill to preserve that partisan advantage by restricting who can participate in primary elections. 
Ohio House Bill 320, introduced by Sandusky County right-winger Gary Click, would close primary voting to only Ohioans who register 90 days in advance as Republicans or Democrats. 
That proposed fix would lock primary voters out of the election process at a decisive stage if they don’t declare party affiliation somewhere in time. A needless bar not to improve outcomes but as a means to broken ends.

Mesha Mainor argues in support of a school voucher bill. Ousted from the Legislature after switching parties, MAinor is running as a Republican to be the next state school superintendent. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA former state representative who switched parties over Georgia’s school voucher plan is joining the race for Georgia School Superintendent as a Republican.
Former Democrat Mesha Mainor became the state Legislature’s first Black Republican woman when she joined the GOP in 2023 following friction over her full-throated support of a proposed voucher bill that passed with her support. The program, which began this year, allows some parents to receive $6,500 in state funds from their local school district if they take their child out of public school and place them into private school or educate them at home.
“I’m running to give parents a voice, protect our children, and make Georgia the number one place to educate a child no matter where the child lives,” Mainor said in a statement announcing her candidacy. “Excellence in Georgia’s classrooms will no longer be a vision. Together with the phenomenal teachers of Georgia in every classroom, school administrators, all school staff, and policy leaders — Georgia will be the number one state to live, work, and educate.”

Kemp signed the controversial voucher bill last April, and Mainor lost her seat the following November, receiving only 16% of the vote in her heavily Democratic district. Mainor and other voucher supporters say they help children in low-performing districts attain a good education that would otherwise be out of reach. Opponents say the program shuffles state dollars into private institutions with little oversight or quality control.
In a phone call Tuesday, Mainor said if she is elected, she will consider expanding the state’s voucher program and work to promote curriculum transparency. She said she will promote workforce readiness in addition to academics, and ensure children are not “indoctrinated” in the classroom, a common concern among rightwing education advocates.
Three other Republicans also have their eyes on becoming Georgia’s next top educator, but they will all have to first convince GOP voters that a change is needed. Three-term incumbent Richard Woods announced his re-election campaign earlier this summer.
Mainor said she’s the best person for the job because of her experience, including founding a language immersion school.
“No other candidate can say ‘I’ve been a legislator before,’ and right now, right at this moment, I know what it’s like to be a parent for a K-12 child and one that just recently went to college,” she said.
Mainor said GOP primary voters can trust her to carry out a conservative agenda despite her past membership with the Democratic Party because she has the zeal of a convert.
“It’s those new Christians that often have more faith than old Christians,” she said. “So to say that I just switched parties, what it means is that I understand what the value systems are of the Republican Party, and that’s why I made such a dramatic switch. It was not easy to make the switch. I was ridiculed. I had racist attacks put on me. I mean, if you look back at my social media after I switched parties, that was a very trying and traumatic time for me, but I stood strong because I was convicted in why I was changing parties.”

Woods, who was first elected in 2014, previously worked for three decades as a teacher and school administrator. Next year will represent the first time Woods has faced multiple primary challengers since he came into office. In 2018 and 2022, he faced off against former state superintendent John Barge but won by comfortable margins both times.
“As State School Superintendent, I have focused on transforming the Georgia Department of Education from a compliance-oriented agency to one centered on service and support for school districts,” Woods said in a June statement announcing his candidacy. “That vision will continue and, as I seek a fourth term, I am committed to expanding the resources and supports we provide directly to teachers.”
Woods is one of Georgia’s few statewide office holders not restricted by term limits or seeking higher office in 2026, but he’s still attracted a line of people hoping to take his job.
Among the Republicans competing with Mainor to take Woods’ seat in May’s GOP primary will be Fred “Bubba” Longgrear, a 29-year educator who currently serves as superintendent in Candler County, Randell Trammell, president and CEO of the Georgia Center for Civic Engagement, a nonprofit focused on expanding civics education, and businesswoman Nelva Lee.
Woods enters the race with more than $58,000 cash on hand, according to financial disclosures. Trammell, the only other candidate to have filed a financial disclosure, reported just over $51,000 in his pocket after loaning his campaign $20,000.
No Democrat has so far announced or filed paperwork to run.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)STURGIS — In a speech formally launching his campaign for Congress on Tuesday, South Dakota Republican Marty Jackley signaled a desire to bring workers into the country legally while preventing unauthorized immigration.
“We need to have a national immigration policy that considers public safety and the workforce,” Jackley said. “We need to have E-Verify and visas working. I promise you I’ll be committed to doing that as your congressman.”
E-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the United States. The system has been beset with well-chronicled problems, including a Cato Institute study alleging thousands of people lost out on jobs because E-Verify incorrectly flagged them.
State lawmaker files statement of candidacy to run for U.S. House

Jackley made his campaign announcement at the Loud American restaurant and bar in Sturgis, on the edge of the Black Hills, where many employers in the area depend on workers with visas to fill seasonal tourism jobs. A visa is a document granting foreigners permission to visit, work or study in the country.
Jackley serves as South Dakota’s attorney general. He’ll continue in that role through next year while running for Congress. There’s an open race for the state’s lone U.S. House seat next year, because Republican South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.
In Jackley’s speech to a room packed with dozens of supporters, he touched on his crime-fighting credentials and his experience serving on a council that advised President Donald Trump on law enforcement issues.
On economic development, Jackley pledged to work toward a “fair playing field” and boasted of winning a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair, which paved the way for states to force certain online retailers to pay state sales taxes. Jackley said the ability to avoid sales taxes gave online retailers an unfair advantage over local stores.
He also recapped his record on government accountability, including his prosecution of six cases since last year against former state employees for allegations related to their work for state government.
In one of the highest-profile cases, Jackley won a guilty verdict at trial in April against a former Department of Social Services worker who stole $1.8 million from the state over a 13-year period. In response to the rash of state employee crimes, Jackley also supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
“I brought legislation so that we can better protect the taxpayer dollars and what’s been going on in Pierre, and I’ll do the same thing if you send me to Washington,” he said.

If Jackley wins, he would be the first person with roots in South Dakota’s less populated West River region — the area west of the Missouri River — to represent the state in the U.S. House since Republican John Thune held the seat from 1997 to 2003. Thune, whose hometown is Murdo, is now the U.S. Senate majority leader.
Jackley, 54, grew up in Sturgis and still has a ranch in the area, along with another ranch near Pierre. After earning an electrical engineering degree from South Dakota Mines, he added a law degree from the University of South Dakota. He served as the U.S. attorney for South Dakota from 2006 to 2009, and then as attorney general for the state from 2009 to 2019.
Term limits prevented him from seeking another consecutive term as attorney general in the 2018 elections. He sought the Republican nomination for governor that year and lost by 12 points in the primary election to Kristi Noem, who went on to serve as governor until leaving earlier this year to lead the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for Trump. Jackley ran for attorney general again in 2022 and was unopposed in the general election.
Besides Jackley, at least one other Republican — state Sen. Casey Crabtree of Madison — has formed a fundraising committee to potentially seek the U.S. House seat. That sets up a possible race in the primary election on June 2, 2026, to determine the Republican nominee before the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.
Democrats may have their own U.S. House primary race with at least three federal statements of candidacy filed so far by Scott Schlagel of Dell Rapids, and Billy Mawhiney and Nikki Gronli, both of Sioux Falls.
Jackley’s candidacy for U.S. House creates an open race for attorney general next year. At least one person — Lance Russell, the Republican state’s attorney of Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties — has announced his intention to seek the job.

Right-wing legislators, advocacy groups, and dark-money donors are trying to dictate what can be taught, which books can be read, and which speakers are welcome on our campuses.
While some lawmakers at the state and national levels have moved to restrict the instruction of topics like race, gender, and history, the Pam Bondi-led Department of Justice-issued guidance on July 29 is designed to handcuff universities and K-12 schools, threatening “significant legal risks” should universities and school districts continue with time-tested, data-proven initiatives to support students.
Is every right-of-center legislator, especially those in locally elected positions, part of the systematic coup against education and our democratic experiment? Of course not, but private dissent is a fool’s errand. Where are their voices? The outspoken redirect to local issues but unlike any other time, national is local.

Christopher M. Piscitelli
The attack on DEI programs, targeting of our LGBTQ+ students, the attempt to push a false version of history into our classrooms is part of a larger platform to reimagine America as a right-wing wet dream. They’re weaponizing fear and exploiting apathy with a goal of tearing down our hallmark institutions by turning them into ideological battlegrounds.
Our greatest fictitious president, Andrew Shepherd, [from the 1995 film, The American President] said it best: “[they] are only interested two things, making you afraid of it and telling you who’s to blame for it.”
Democracy is being tested, not in our history books, but right now. It is not whether we say the right things, but whether we do the right things. In his 1961 Inaugural Address, John F. Kennedy said, “every one of us is in a position of responsibility; and, in the final analysis, the kind of government we get depends upon how we fulfill those responsibilities. We, the people, are the boss, and we will get the kind of political leadership, be it good or bad, that we demand and deserve.”
Before the public trust in universities erodes, we must recommit to free inquiry and resist censorship pressures. Our democratic experiment cannot function without a citizenry trained to think critically and engage in healthy debate and dialogue. We must not allow our classrooms to be turned into civic battlegrounds of censorship and fear.
Today, we must resoundingly say, no more. Voting is the bare minimum. Organizing, volunteering, donating, speaking up — that’s how we make real change.

In Hamden, challenger Adam Sendroff won the Democratic mayoral nomination with 47% of the vote in a five-way race. Dominique Baez, the party-endorsed candidate, was a distant second with 22%.  
Sendroff, the former school board chair, is all but assured of victory in November in heavily Democratic Hamden. He would succeed Mayor Lauren Garrett, a Democrat who did not seek reelection. Baez’ campaign was hit by news of her business being evicted.
In Norwalk, the largest city with a mayoral primary, council president Barbara Smyth defeated fellow council member Darlene Young, becoming the instant favorite to succeed the long-serving Democrat, Mayor Harry Rilling, who did not seek reelection.
In Bridgeport, there is no mayoral race this year, but absentee ballots once again played a decisive role in a Democratic primary: According to Only in Bridgeport, the political web site, Councilwoman Maria Pereira won her primary while losing at the polls and winning on the absentees. 
Pereira is currently facing criminal charges arising from the alleged abuse of absentee ballots in the 2023 municipal election.
Overall, voters went to the polls in 21 communities for 11 Democratic and 10 Republican primaries. Nominations for either mayor or first selectman were on the ballot in five GOP and four Democratic contests.
The Democratic primaries were in Bloomfield, Bridgeport, Chester, Hamden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, North Haven, Norwalk, Stamford and Stratford.
In addition to the mayoral races in Hamden, Norwalk and Stratford, there was a Democratic primary for first selectman in Chester; the incumbent, Cynthia Lignar, easily defeated her challenger, Joe Cohen. 
David Chess, the endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate in Stratford, won with nearly 90% of the vote over Linda Manos for the right to face the Republican mayor, Laura Hoydick, in November.
The GOP races were in Greenwich, Griswold, Haddam, Oxford, Plainfield, Sterling, Thomaston, Voluntown, Waterbury and Wolcott, with the nominations for the chief-elected positions at stake in Oxford, Plainfield, Sterling, Voluntown and Wolcott.
First Selectman George R. Temple of Oxford, who led the community through a devastating flood last year in his seventh term, was stunned to be denied the GOP endorsement in July. Rather than retire at 79, he forced a primary and defeated his former protege, Jeffrey Luff.
Unofficial results showed him winning with 57% of the vote.
Perhaps the quirkiest race of the night was in Plainfield, a small town near the Rhode Island border. 
Like Temple, the Republican incumbent, Kevin M. Cunningham, was snubbed in a GOP caucus. But there was a twist: the endorsement went to a Democratic predecessor, Paul E. Sweet, who switched parties.
Cunningham won Tuesday night with 51% of the vote.
In Voluntown, the endorsed Republican, Brian Muschiano, defeated challenger  Christopher A. Wilson for first selectman with 61% of the vote. The Republican incumbent, Tracey Hanson, is not running after winning four terms, the last three without opposition.
In nearby Sterling, the endorsed Republican, Myron “Jack” Joslyn, won with 52% in a three-way with Frank Bood Sr. and Kimberly Ann Gunn. Joslyn, a selectman, would step up to succeed First Selectman Lincoln Cooper, who is not running.
In Wolcott, where the unaffiliated mayor, Thomas G. Dunn, has been unopposed in four consecutive races, the GOP challenger, Paul D.

Wes Moore (D) officially announced his reelection campaign Tuesday, saying that any challengers should ""be prepared to defend their record,"" including when it comes to President Donald Trump (R). (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)It isn’t clear who he’ll be up against come November 2026, but Gov. Wes Moore (D), who formally announced his reelection bid on Tuesday, already has a message for the eventual challenger.
“Whoever it is, they should come ready, because we have a very real record to run on — and a record that we’re very proud of,” said Moore, adding that he intends to make any GOP challenger’s ties to President Donald Trump (R) a campaign issue in deep-blue Maryland.
“Whether it’s Republican Ed Hale or Republican Steve Hershey or Republican Larry Hogan or Republican Andy Harris or Republican John Myrick — there’s a lot of people who are making a similar type of noise,” Moore said.
Only one of the people he named, Myrick, has officially entered the race. Hershey, the Senate minority leader who represents the Upper Shore, announced last week that he had formed a gubernatorial exploratory committee — partly in response to Hale, a businessman and lifelong Democrat who recently switched parties after acknowledging he was unlikely to beat Moore in a Democratic primary.
Hogan, the state’s first two-term Republican governor in decades, who served from 2014 to 2022, has been coy about his 2026 plans. Harris, the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, has not indicated that he plans to run for governor.
During Tuesday’s news conference outside the State House, Moore touted the economic side of his record, pointing to job growth since he took office, and arguing that his administration has slowed “out-of-control spending” in Maryland. It comes after a uniquely tough budget year, during which the General Assembly had to cut spending and raise fees to overcome a $3.3 billion deficit projected for fiscal 2026.
But Moore also pointed to historic reductions in violent crime, even as he continues to feud with Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore to crack down on criminal activity. With the city experiencing a dramatic decline in homicides, Moore and others say federal troops are not needed, although the governor did announce a heightened deployment of state police in the city Friday.
Hershey forms exploratory committee, will weigh run for governor

Whichever Republican Moore faces in the 2026 general election in 2026, it’s clear that Trump will loom large. Moore said Tuesday that Republican candidates should also come prepared to “explain why they have been so dead silent, when we’re watching the ravages of Donald Trump coming to the state.”
On Tuesday, Moore was quick to attack the president on everything from tax policy to federal job cuts — including in a video announcement that officially kicked off his candidacy. There, he argued that Trump is “bending over backwards for billionaires and big corporations.”
The video garnered a social media response from at least one Moore opponent in Myrick, who finished a distant fifth to Hogan in a seven-candidate Republican primary field for U.S. Senate in 2024.
“What a crock,” Myrick wrote of Moore’s announcement. “Maryland deserves better.”
Myrick, a Prince George’s County resident who chose former state Del. Brenda Thiam as his running mate, has targeted Moore on economic and tax issues in particular, and argued that steep cuts to Maryland’s federal workforce are a result of Moore’s refusal to “work with” the Trump administration.
In addition to Myrick, the only other Republican to officially file for governor is Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll County firearms instructor. Moore does have one Democratic challenger, Ralph Jaffe, who has run unsuccessfully for governor or U.S. senators in eight previous elections going back to 1992.
Moore’s campaign kickoff also drew a response Tuesday from the conservative Maryland Freedom Caucus, which pointed to the fact that Moore signed a budget with $1.6 billion in taxes and fees. It also said some of the spending cuts claimed by Moore were merely “gimmicks,” that included declining to fill vacant government jobs, transferring funds from special accounts and shifting some costs to local governments.
“Governor Moore has presided over the largest tax hike in Maryland history and a relentless barrage of new fees on working families,” read the caucus statement. “No speech can spin those facts away.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Tuesday, Moore held up the taxes, fees and spending cuts as an example of “fiscal discipline,” though it came out of necessity in his third year in office. The General Assembly convened in January — less than two weeks before Trump’s inauguration — with the knowledge that it would need to resolve the $3.3 billion gap between spending and revenue before it could adjourn 90 days later.
“We were able to make those smart, strategic cuts while also giving the middle class a tax cut — and yes, asking those who have done very well to invest a little bit more so we could actually have the best public schools and have safe streets,” Moore said of tax increases on higher-income earners.
Moore’s reelection announcement comes amid persistent rumors that he plans to run for president in 2028 — a rumor that Moore has repeatedly dismissed, including on a Sunday appearance on “Meet the Press.”
“I have never once said that I am interested,” Moore said Tuesday of the presidency. “So when people say ‘Are you ruling it out?’ my point is I’ve never ruled it in. I’ve been focused on this job. And I appreciate the fact that people in Maryland and that people around the country are paying attention to the progress we’ve made.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC02577-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 22:56:37.427039

Hers was one of many grievances that professors brought to a rally Tuesday to protest the fact that almost a year after unionizing they still have no contract with the college. A few dozen faculty, students, union leaders and other supporters at the rally had a simple message: Pay staff fair and timely wages.
For the past several years, rallygoers said, some faculty have received pay that was a few weeks to several months late. Union leaders said some employees endure inaccurate payments, or none at all. When classes started on Aug. 25, union leaders said, more than 50 had no instructor.

“These issues have damaged our college community and have occurred for far too long. It is time for the community to stand together and speak out,” Cook-Hayes said.
To address the problems, full-time faculty at the college certified United Academics of Maryland in October 2024, an affiliate of American Federal of Teachers-Maryland.
AFT Maryland President Kenya Campbell said Tuesday she hopes college administration does right by the staff.
“We want to be a partner in this work. We have a couple of ideas, but again, we’re not the ones cutting the check,” she said. “But I think we have enough experience and ideas that we can talk it through and find a really, really good, effective resolution to the problem.”
After rallying for about 25 minutes, faculty and supporters walked to the administration building to deliver a list of demands to College President Debra McCurdy. They were greeted instead by Michael Thomas, the vice president of workforce development and continuing education, who took the list from Ryan Castle, AFT Maryland higher ed organizer, before everyone left the lobby.
The list of requests includes:

Timely and accurate pay for all faculty, including overload and adjunct work;
Transparent communication and accountability from BCCC administration;
Hiring and staffing solutions to fill vacant courses and reduce student impact; and
Support for all faculty and respect for collective bargaining rights.

Shortly after the rally, the college released a statement to acknowledge and “respect” the faculty union’s right to rally to express its priorities.
“The College remains committed to the collective bargaining process and is negotiating in good faith to reach a fair and sustainable agreement that recognizes the invaluable contributions of our faculty,” the statement said. “We believe that a successful resolution must be one that not only provides competitive wages and benefits but also ensures the long-term financial health of the College for the benefit of all members of our community — including our students, staff, and taxpayers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But it went on to say that “we firmly believe the most productive path forward is at the bargaining table. We urge the union’s leadership to continue engaging with us constructively so we can conclude these negotiations and provide stability for our faculty and the entire College community.”
McCurdy was not a focus of the rally — her name was only mentioned once, as rallying faculty walked to deliver the list of demands — but she was clearly on the minds of some union leaders Tuesday.
“I don’t know if the president or the leader of this institution is missing paychecks, but I highly doubt it,” said Baltimore AFL-CIO President Courtney Jenkins. “I bet if they did, this issue would not be an issue.”
One particular issue is the lack of specialized supplies, like jackets, for students in the dental hygiene program, said Gwen Farmer, a clinical instructor in the dental hygiene clinic. Farmer, an adjunct professor at the college, also recalled being paid about two months late.
“I come here not for the money. I come here to teach and educate, and like to be compensated and get a little something for doing it right,” said Farmer, a 2000 graduate of the college who works in a dental office and does dental hygiene work at nursing homes.
Campbell, the AFT president, said she remains hopeful.
“I’m hoping that they have heard our loud voices. They have seen our presence and, more importantly, the demands that we had in writing that we handed over to them,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rally-at-BCCC-9-9-2025-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-09 22:56:37.427039

(Photo by Jed Workman/Provided by U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Since the 1990s, well-heeled visitors have flocked to Valdez for some of the most famous adventures in the skiing world: guided helicopter tours to long, steep mountain slopes with untouched powder and stunning views of the Prince William Sound scenery.
The Valdez heli-skiing industry is an economic boon to the coastal city of roughly 3,700 that is otherwise best known for the marine terminal of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. But the growing industry  has its drawbacks as well, like avalanche risks, noise, environmental degradation and potential conflicts with others recreating or traveling in the backcountry of the Chugach Mountains.
Now federal regulators are considering whether to continue permitted operations mostly as they have occurred over the past decade or make some changes.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Aug. 27 released a draft environmental assessment to guide the next decade of’ heli-skiing activities. The draft proposes that up to eight operators be allowed to obtain permits for the next 10 seasons, which run from January to May during the years from 2026 to 2035.
The BLM is seeking public comments on the draft through Sept. 25.
So far, six companies have already applied for permits to operate over that period; four of them are seeking permit renewals and two companies are new to the area.
The environmental assessment started last year. It is intended to produce a decision about whether to grant those 10-year permits and if so, whether to attach some new conditions.
The process concerns only lands in the area that the BLM owns and manages. The U.S. Forest Service and state of Alaska own other lands in the area that are used for heliskiing, but their permitting is separate.
The BLM is going through the environmental assessment now because the current 10-year special use permits for heli-skiing operators are expiring, said Gordon Claggett, an agency spokesperson.
“To authorize the next phase of special recreation permits, we have to go through an environmental review process,” he said by email. “Applications drive the environmental review.”
The BLM manages about 150,000 acres in the area considered suitable for heli-skiing, of which 133,800 is considered available for that activity. The remainder is closed to protect wildlife.
In the spring of 2024, the BLM received a flurry of public comments, both supportive and critical of Valdez-area heli-skiing, during what is called the scoping period, the preliminary step in the environmental review.
Some commenters argued in favor of an increase in the number of heli-skiing permits, citing economic benefits. Others argued for more restrictions, saying the heli-skiing companies operating now have caused numerous conflicts and negative effects.
The agency’s draft environmental assessment acknowledges those user conflicts and says they might increase as winter recreation expands, though they are likely to vary according to snow and weather conditions.
“The greatest level of conflict would potentially occur on days when the weather is clear and there is adequate snow and cooler temperatures that create ideal conditions for both heli-skiers and backcountry skiers and both user groups are in the area at the same time,” it says.

But they didn’t get an Indiana-like pitch about redistricting a red state. (Al Drago/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Thirteen Nebraska state lawmakers visited Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. But they didn’t get an Indiana-like pitch about redistricting a red state, as reporters waited. 
Instead, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs hosted lawmakers from Nebraska and Iowa to “hear firsthand” how President Donald Trump and his team are implementing his approach and how to “advance it at the state and local level.” 
While that was the official reason, national and local news outlets reported in recent days that Trump’s team might use the meeting to discuss mid-decade redistricting with Nebraska lawmakers.
People familiar with how the meeting unfolded told the Examiner on Tuesday that redistricting wasn’t discussed, partly because of the attention surrounding the gathering. The White House had considered talking to lawmakers in small groups about it, but didn’t. 
Some of the same sources said the conversations could still happen, but that it was a little too early in the process to risk a leaked discussion. 
The conference featured cabinet secretaries, White House senior staff and people working for various federal agencies and departments. The invitation said they would get to ask federal officials questions.  
Among the Nebraska state senators attending were Loren Lippincott of Central City, Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, Dave Murman of Glenville, Barry DeKay of Niobrara, Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, Beau Ballard of Lincoln, Paul Strommen of Sidney, Rob Clements of Elmwood, Ben Hansen of Blair, Brian Hardin of Gering, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County and Barry DeKay of Niobrara.

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, confirmed that the governor’s chief of staff and policy director both attended the meeting, saying that their presence was typical for such White House summits. 
“Team Pillen has worked hard to build relationships throughout President Trump’s administration, and we are always excited for opportunities to strengthen our partnership,” Strimple said. 
The four-hour conference touched on Trump tariffs, college accreditation and how it’s determined, expanding school choice, reining in college costs and reducing student debt and election integrity.

White House staff also discussed how the Trump Small Business Administration is reducing regulations, said Lippincott, who spoke with the Examiner while flying back to Nebraska. 
Lippincott said the group talked about getting rid of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or DEI, and someone from the Trump Administration talked about how “we need to go to paper ballots,” for which President Donald Trump recently expressed support. The president also has said states should stop using ballots by mail and voting machines, which election experts have defended as reliable. 
Kauth told the Examiner the gathering was “just a meeting of federal and state government leaders to develop better communication and relationships.”
The pause in a White House pitch to redistrict Nebraska in time for the 2026 midterms  — to make the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District harder for Democrats to win — comes during the ramp-up of a national redistricting tit for tat that Trump helped start in Texas. Texas lawmakers recently approved a new map designed to help the GOP win up to five additional seats in the U.S. House next year. 
The White House pressed Indiana state lawmakers about redistricting during a visit to the nation’s capital last month. The Missouri House passed its own redrawn congressional map, which targets a Kansas City-area House district currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. 
Democratic-led states are considering pursuing partisan redistricting efforts in response, including in California and New York. 
While Republicans hold all three of Nebraska’s congressional seats, political experts see the now open-seat 2nd District race as a potential pickup for Democrats in 2026. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has announced he would not run again.
Another hurdle for any Nebraska redistricting push: Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Legislature might lack the numbers needed to make the change. One Nebraska GOP state lawmaker questioned privately whether a mid-decade redistricting effort would have 25 votes.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista didn’t attend the D.C. meeting. Also, one of the key GOP holdouts who helped stop last year’s push to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president, Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, didn’t attend, citing scheduling conflicts. He has said he’s “not a big fan of changing the rules in the middle of the game.” And Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who opposed the winner-take-all push, didn’t attend. 
But Pillen has shown a willingness to try even when he lacks the votes. He pressed for the Legislature to take up winner-take-all without the votes.

Barbara Kirkmeyer announced her 2026 run for governor Tuesday. 
Kirkmeyer, a 66-year-old Weld County Republican, currently serves on the powerful Joint Budget Committee in the Colorado Legislature. She ran to represent Colorado’s 8th Congressional District in 2022. 
“Colorado is ready for a new direction,” Kirkmeyer said at a campaign launch event Tuesday in Fort Lupton. “It’s ready to chart a new path. It’s ready for a common sense conservative leader who will roll up her sleeves, work with people, and deliver real results, not play political games.”

Before she was first elected to the state Senate in 2020, Kirkmeyer served as a Weld County commissioner, when she helped lead a plan among several northern Colorado counties to secede from the state. She lost her bid to represent the 8th District to Democrat Yadira Caraveo by less than a full percentage point. 
As a member of the JBC, she is heavily involved in crafting the state’s budget each year and is typically a bipartisan sponsor of many budgetary bills. She also sponsored a bipartisan measure this year that reformed Colorado’s process for filling vacancies in the Legislature, and she touts her work on major property tax cuts during the 2024 legislative session.










Colorado is ready for a new direction ... It's ready to chart a new path. It's ready for a common sense conservative leader who will roll up her sleeves, work with people, and deliver real results, not play political games.


– State Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, Colorado governor candidate


If elected, Kirkmeyer said she would defend Colorado’s Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which restricts state tax revenue collection and spending, and ensure taxes are not raised. She criticized the Legislature’s most recent special session, which she said “was not a special session about fixing the budget” but was “about increasing taxes.” She also wants to see the state support small businesses “without government red tape.” 
Colorado Republicans supporting Kirkmeyer at her campaign kick off included state Reps. Carlos Barron of Fort Lupton, Ryan Gonzalez of Greeley and Dan Woog of Erie, as well as state Sen. Byron Pelton of Sterling and Colorado State Board of Education member Yazmin Navarro.

Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has been in office since 2019, is term-limited in 2026. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running on the Democratic side of the race. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election, and Polis won reelection in 2022 by nearly 20 percentage points.
‘A different vision for Colorado’
Kirkmeyer is loyal to Republican President Donald Trump, “not Colorado families,” Ben Waldon, Bennet’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
“She backed Trump’s reckless bill that will strip health care from tens of thousands and shut down Colorado rural hospitals and nursing homes, and she’s all in on Trump’s economic agenda, already a disaster for Colorado families, workers, and small businesses,” Waldon said, referring to the GOP’s domestic policy megabill, which Trump signed in July. 
Weiser said Kirkmeyer tried to stop him from “defending our state” against Trump administration policies, but he welcomed her to the race and said he looks forward to “a debate about the values and leadership Colorado needs and deserves in this moment.”
“I have a different vision for Colorado — focused on freedom and opportunity for all — and will fight hard for it,” Weiser said in a statement. 
Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said Kirkmeyer is “eager to please” Republican party donors and blasted her defense of Colorado Republicans in Congress for supporting the Republican megabill. 
Other prominent Republican candidates who have announced a run for governor include state Sen. Mark Baisley, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, former U.S. Rep. Greg Lopez and Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, among several others. Kirkmeyer said her experience leading a state agency under Republican Gov. Bill Owens, as a county commissioner, and as a member of the JBC sets her apart from other Republican candidates in the race.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)MITCHELL — As China boycotts U.S. soybean purchases, a $500 million processing plant south of Mitchell that will turn more of the state’s crop into oils and livestock meal opened its doors Tuesday.
Tom Kersting, the CEO of South Dakota Soybean Processors, which manages the plant, said it will help stabilize prices and create local demand.
“If it wasn’t for demand sources like this facility, it’d be very, very tough out there,” Kersting said, calling China, until now, the number one buyer of South Dakota’s exported beans.
China is avoiding U.S. soybeans this fall in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

The High Plains Processing Plant is designed to crush about 35 million bushels of soybeans per year. South Dakota farmers produced about 238 million bushels last year. Kersting said the facility will produce soybean meal (animal feed) and soybean oil. The oil can be refined on-site into vegetable oil or a soybean-based diesel fuel, called renewable diesel.
“There’s great demand for soybean oil from the renewable fuels industry,” he said. “And soybean meal is the preferred high-protein feed additive for hogs, poultry, dairy — you name it.” 
Craig Weber is the president of the South Dakota Soybean Processors board. He said the project’s impact will be most immediate on the gap between the bean price and what farmers actually receive. That gap is significantly impacted by transportation costs, and the new plant being in Mitchell reduces those costs for farmers in the region.
Still, farm advocates cautioned that one facility cannot fully offset the loss of the world’s largest soybean buyer. 
“No, it’s not going to be enough,” said Doug Sombke, president of South Dakota Farmers Union. 
Sombke and a delegation of about 40 farmers were in Washington, D.C., earlier this week to express their concerns to Congress. 
“It helps, yeah, but it’s going to take a lot more,” Sombke said. “Farmers are in a lot of trouble. We’re going to lose farmers if we don’t do something quick.”
Governor Larry Rhoden, who spoke at the opening, called the project an example of the kind of value-added agriculture South Dakota should pursue. 
“We’re talking about enhancing our number one industry, which is agriculture,” he said. 
He also praised the plant’s ability to process other oilseeds, like sunflowers, offering farmers more flexibility depending on circumstances in the crop markets.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A former South Dakota Department of Health employee was sentenced to two years of probation and a $500 fine Tuesday in Hughes County Court for illegally issuing herself a medical marijuana card.
Alexandra Feiner, 24, of Pierre, had pleaded guilty earlier to one felony count of offering a false or forged instrument for filing, registering or recording.
The crime occurred in March 2024. By issuing a card to herself, Feiner illegally avoided both the medical provider certification requirement and a required fee.
She received a suspended imposition of sentence, which means she’ll avoid two years in prison if she abides by the terms of her probation.
Feiner’s case is one of six that Attorney General Marty Jackley has prosecuted against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work for state government.
“There are 14,000 state government employees in South Dakota and the overwhelming majority work hard for South Dakota,” Jackley said Tuesday in a news release. “The behavior of one should not reflect poorly on the majority.”

The other five cases ranged from the illegal use of a foster family food voucher for a state employee’s own expenses, to the stealing of $1.8 million from the Department of Social Services over the course of 13 years.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order in April mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal delivers whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, at a hearing on the Franklin County prison on Sept. 9, 2025. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A motion to subpoena the former secretary of the Arkansas Department of Corrections failed on a voice vote of senators on the Joint Performance Review Committee during a hearing Tuesday on alleged impropriety in the site selection process for the Franklin County prison.
Multiple legislators voiced anger over Joe Profiri’s absence at the hearing, which was called in response to a petition by Adam Watson and Natalie Cadena, members of a coalition of opponents to the location of the 3,000-bed prison near Charleston.
The committee did not take any action during the four-hour hearing, with JPR Co-Chair Sen. Terry Rice of Waldron saying the hearing was primarily informational and for the sake of “transparency.” He thanked Watson and Cadena for their presentation.
Joe Profiri
The Board of Corrections fired Profiri at the beginning of 2024 after weeks of tensions between him and board members. After he was fired, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders hired him to advise her on corrections matters — but Watson and Cadena alleged in their petition and during the hearing that Profiri is still deeply involved in running the department. Sanders tapped Lindsay Wallace, Profiri’s then chief of staff, as his replacement, and the board agreed to hire her.
Watson said Profiri’s continued involvement in the proposed prison after Wallace’s appointment amounts to duplication of two high-salaried positions.
Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, expressed frustration over water supply issues at the site and anger over Profiri’s failure to appear before the committee despite being invited by committee co-chairs Rice and Rep. Bruce Cozart of Hot Springs. Wooten said he is “for the prison,” but after hearing the detailed presentation from Watson and Cadena, he said “the location we picked is the wrong one.” He criticized selecting the site without the many preliminary tests necessary to determine if the site was truly viable, such as soil testing.
“Somebody needs to kick the chair back and tell the governor how it is,” Wooten said. “For one, I’m furious about the fact that Mr. [Profiri], whatever his name is, from Arizona, didn’t get here. … Committee members, that’s a slap at every one of you that the governor’s office is not here.”
“I think it is a slap at this body not to even answer us and say he cannot be here,” Rice said.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Sanders, said her office would continue to meet with legislators to answer questions and get the prison built.
“The Governor’s Office provided the committee with two experts [from the Division of Building Authority] who have been intimately involved in the Franklin County prison project, and since the announcement of the new prison, the Governor’s team has held a town hall in Franklin County to answer questions from the community and has been in contact with Franklin County leaders,” Dubke said in a text message.
Many local community members, however, remain adamantly against the prison’s location, accusing the state of not talking with them nor listening to their concerns. That anger drove the petition submitted by Watson and Cadena. Their complaint argues that:

“It is improper for Arkansas taxpayers to be burdened with supporting the salary of two leaders of the Department of Corrections.”
“It is an improper use of taxpayer funds to pay a consultant for a task while simultaneously having an unqualified state agency perform the same task.”
“Expending taxpayer funds on a capital project without funding for such [a] project is irresponsible and improper.”
“Failing to conduct proper due diligence on real property prior to its purchase is irresponsible and improper.”

Watson and Cadena’s presentation primarily focused on point four — whether the state had done proper due diligence when selecting the site. They argued the area didn’t have sufficient infrastructure — from water sources to suitable roads to a sufficient workforce — to support a prison for 3,000 people, and that the state didn’t conduct any adequate testing until after the purchase of the 810-acre property.
They presented legislators in attendance with internal communications and documents obtained via the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act that they said showed due diligence had not been done. By the end of the presentation, some lawmakers expressed their concerns, but many remained silent.
Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, who represents parts of Franklin County, said that if half of what Watson and Cadena presented to the committee was accurate, then he didn’t believe the state had done what it needed to do.
“I don’t think we should expect our state employees necessarily to have the expertise to make these decisions,” Eubanks said, adding that he wasn’t blaming state employees for that. “There seems to be an unwillingness to even consider another site at this point, and I don’t understand that either.”
Rep. Brit McKenzie, R-Rogers, asked Anne Laidlaw, director of the Division of Building Authority, and Shelby Johnson, who heads the geographic information services office, whether they had been asked to consider other sites for the prison since Sanders announced the decision to locate the prison in Franklin County last year. They said no.
Republican Sen. Jimmy Hickey Jr. of Texarkana said he was at the hearing to find a way to vote to fund the prison’s construction, “but all I’m doing is getting further and further and further away.” An appropriations bill to fund prison construction, authored by Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang of Searcy, was voted down in the Senate five times before the 2025 regular session ended earlier this year. Hickey voted no each time.
“Obviously, with what’s come out, this isn’t going to work,” Hickey said. “I heard you say earlier that” an existing water line “had the potential” to supply the prison, “well, the potential is going to cost how much more now?”
Some of the criticism relating to the prison site came from allegations that the state didn’t follow its own site selection criteria. Watson pointed to criteria for community buy-in as a chief example of this. Watson and Cadena also argued that DBA staff were not qualified to do the site selection.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer) Gov. Tim Walz said he will call a special legislative session to push for gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, even if he isn’t able to strike a deal with lawmakers.
“I will call a special session one way or another,” Walz told reporters Tuesday after meeting with Republican and Democratic legislative leaders behind closed doors. “Just have the hope. Just bring it up. Have the discussion … Maybe it doesn’t pass because the numbers aren’t there but at least we’re going to know.”
The governor typically calls a special session once lawmakers agree on what bills will be passed and the duration of the session. Walz has the sole ability to call a special session, but only lawmakers can gavel themselves out, which is typically why the governor and lawmakers come to an agreement beforehand.
By pushing ahead with what could be a quixotic effort in the face of GOP intransigence on new gun laws, Walz is signaling that he’s looking to get Republicans on the record on gun proposals — and especially an assault weapons ban — even if there’s no hope for legislation, which could translate into a rancorous session.
Walz said he will propose a gun control package in the coming days. It will include a ban on the heavy weaponry frequently used in mass shootings and often referred to as assault weapons.
Republicans — who are strongly aligned with the gun rights movement and led by Speaker Lisa Demuth —  have 67 members in the Minnesota House, while Democrats have 66 in their ranks following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. After a Sept. 16 special election, the House is expected to return to a tie.
The Minnesota Senate also has two absences after the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, R-Buffalo, and the resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury. Any bill needs 34 votes to pass, meaning all 33 Democrats would need to vote together with at least one Republican joining them.
This means that any legislation proposed in a special session will need bipartisan approval.
Senate Democrats voting in a unified bloc for gun control is no sure thing; at least three Democratic senators — Grant Hauschild of Hermantown, Rob Kupec of Moorhead and Judy Seeberger of Afton — have been difficult to pin down on where they stand on an assault weapons ban. 
Walz is hoping that the shooting of a church filled with schoolchildren will pressure at least a few Republicans to vote for gun control, perhaps suburban members concerned about voters’ anger with their inaction. Demuth said she would need to look at specific bill language before she could say if her caucus would vote for it.
“House Republicans are committed to making sure that we are keeping our schools and our communities safe,” Demuth said.
Her caucus last week released a “school safety agenda” in response to the Annunciation shooting that didn’t include any proposals on gun control. Instead, they called for increased funding for school safety at private schools, boosting funding for more mental health treatment beds and increasing penalties for repeat firearm offenders. Their agenda also includes reversing a conversion therapy ban for minors, which would allow therapists to try to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender.
DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson, whose caucus elected him their new leader Monday, said in his first appearance that he hopes Republicans will listen to the families affected by gun violence because they are demanding lawmakers take action.
“The reason I’m standing before you all right now is because of an act of gun violence,” said Stephenson, referring to Hortman’s assassination. “That’s the reason I’m here.” Hortman had been a mentor to Stephenson since he was a young man.
Walz and legislative leaders will continue to meet behind closed doors to see if they can come to a pre-session agreement. Walz said he would like to call a special session “sooner rather than later” but didn’t give specifics.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3591-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-09-09 21:57:21.168063

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In an unprecedented move, New Mexico is making child care free.
Beginning in November, it will be the first state in the nation to provide child care to all residents regardless of income, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced this week.
The state has been working to lower child care care costs since 2019, when it created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department and started to expand eligibility for universal child care. This latest change removes income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments.
The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually.
“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of $13,000 on child care annually. It’s much higher in many states.
In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years.
The state’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support.
The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion. Latinas in New Mexico led the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said.
The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour.
The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options.
Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dow told the Albuquerque Journal that she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state’s child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported.
But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation.
“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we’ll be one of the first to apply.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/child-care2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 21:57:21.168063

The Trump administration in August demanded 46 states and territories remove all references to gender ideology in a federally-funded program that provides health education to adolescents, or risk losing grants. 
Montana has 60 days to remove the flagged content and submit a copy of modified materials for approval, or could forfeit up to $539,601 according to Department of Health and Human Services data. 
Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for DPHHS, told the Daily Montanan in an email that the department did not develop the program’s educational materials, and would comply with the federal request. 
“In the coming weeks, we will ensure that the curriculum is modified by our grantees in accordance with ACF guidance,” Ebelt said. “In addition, the Gianforte administration does not believe that minor children should be taught gender ideology.”
The Personal Responsibility Education Program was authorized by Congress in 2010 to help reduce teen pregnancies to the tune of $75 million annually. The programs are administered on a state level and are expected to be “evidence-based, provide education on both abstinence and contraceptive use, and educate youth on at least three of six adulthood preparation topics,” according to the federal Administration for Children and Families.  
Earlier this year, the administration requested each state, tribal and competitive grant recipient to provide curriculum and programmatic materials related to their respective PREP grant programs “for a medical accuracy review” and program compliance. 
“ACF has a statutory duty to ensure the content being taught in federally funded PREP programs is medically accurate and age appropriate,” ACF Acting Assistant Secretary Andrew Gradison said in a press statement in April. “Parents have a right to know what their children are being taught, and the American people deserve transparency about how their tax dollars are being spent.”
After reviewing the programs, ACF requested 46 states and territories, including Montana, update their programmatic materials to remove references to gender ideology or risk forfeiting their federal funding. 
California already lost its grant — worth $12.5 million — after the state refused to comply with the orders. 
In Montana, the Department of Public Health and Human Services administers a PREP program called Optimal Health for Montana Youth. 
The program defines optimal health as encompassing five different areas — physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual — and the program uses that framework to approach sex education and teen pregnancy prevention. 
According to DPHHS, local county public health nurses and educators work with schools to teach healthy relationship and communication skills, adolescent development, and other life skills through the Optimal Health program, and around 1,400 students are served through the program annually. 
An ACF overview of Montana’s PREP program indicates that the target population is “American Indian and white youth, ages 10 to 19, in the juvenile justice system, alternative schools, Job Corps and youth who are pregnant/parenting under 21 years of age.” The curriculum is implemented in schools, reservations, juvenile justice, addiction services and community based settings in Silver Bow, Custer, Rosebud, Deer Lodge, Flathead and Missoula Counties. 
In a letter to DHPPS Community Health Section Supervisor Darla Dexter, Acting Secretary Gradison stated that references to gender ideology fell outside the scope of authorized subjects. 
 Among the issues the federal government found in Montana’s curriculum was a recommendation against dividing classes by gender “as it can cause trauma for transgender, gender non-conforming, and nonbinary youth;” emphasizing how “teens of all sexual orientations and gender identities need to learn how to draw the line to resist sexual pressure and protect themselves;” and discussions on preferred pronouns, and respecting the differences in each individual, including their gender identity and gender expression. 
The letter states that gender ideology “is both irrelevant to teaching abstinence and contraception and unrelated to any of the adult preparation subjects,” allowed in PREP curriculum. 
“The statute neither requires, supports nor authorizes teaching students that gender identity is distinct from biological sex or that boys can identify as girls and vice versa; thus, gender ideology is outside the scope of the authorizing statute and any expenditures associated with gender ideology are not allowable, reasonable, or allocable to the PREP grant,” the letter states. 
Previous curricula for Montana’s PREP programs had been approved by the federal government, which Gradison described as an error in the prior administration.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HS1A0013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 20:56:54.262226

Gerry Connolly in Virginia’s 11th Congressional District, narrowing Republicans’ majority in the House of Representatives to six seats. The Associated Press called the race in Walkinshaw’s favor at 7:36 p.m., with the Democrat taking 74.9% of the vote compared to Republican contender Stewart Whitson’s 25.1%.
Live election results: Virginia’s 11th Congressional District special election

Connolly endorsed Walkinshaw, his former chief of staff, before he died in May.
Walkinshaw, who also serves on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, defeated Whitson in a suburban Washington D.C. district that Democrats have held since Connolly first won the seat in 2008.
President Donald Trump figured heavily into Walkinshaw’s campaign. In one ad, Walkinshaw described the election as “our first chance to send a Democrat to Congress since Trump took office again.” He has presented himself as a counterweight to Trump’s agenda on everything from DOGE to the president’s Big Beautiful Bill. 
The district’s proximity to the capital loomed large in his race, with Walkinshaw denouncing Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce and his deployment of National Guard troops to D.C.
Whitson, an Army veteran who works for a conservative think tank, faced daunting odds in a district Kamala Harris won by more than 30 points last year. He was also outflanked in fundraising, capturing less than a quarter of the more than $1 million raised by Walkinshaw.
Whitson’s rhetoric followed Trumpian themes, calling for an end to “waste, fraud and abuse” and describing the U.S. Department of Education as a “failed experiment.”
Like Walkinshaw, Connolly was a former Congressional staffer turned Fairfax supervisor. He won a 2008 race to replace longtime Republican Rep. Tom Davis, fended off a close Republican challenge in 2010, and won the ensuing elections by large margins as Northern Virginia became more solidly Democratic. 
Connolly announced he’d been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in November, 2024, days after being reelected. In April, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee said he would not run for re-election and endorsed Walkinshaw shortly thereafter. Connolly died a few weeks later.
After over 30 years of public service, Virginia Congressman Gerry Connolly dies at 75

Walkinshaw’s campaign briefly drew national attention after Connolly’s social media accounts reiterated those endorsements after the Democrat’s death, in the midst of the ensuing nine-person primary. Walkinshaw emerged with nearly 60% of the vote.
As a supervisor, Walkinshaw voted against adopting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s model policies for public schools which aimed to limit transgender students’ access to bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. He backed a plan to replace a county parking lot with 279 units of affordable housing, and drove a successful effort to replace the county’s gas-powered leaf blowers with electric ones.
In Congress, Walkinshaw has pledged to work to ban assault-style weapons, expand federal non-discrimination protections, protect victims of sexual assault and eliminate partisan gerrymandering. 
Walkinshaw differs from his former boss on at least one policy item: crypto. Walkinshaw received a $1 million boost in broadcast ads from the crypto lobbying group Protect Progress, Axios reported in June, and touts blockchain as a transformative technology on his campaign website. Connolly consistently voted against industry-backed legislation.

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderA Fulton County judge says he is likely to throw out racketeering charges filed against 61 people in connection with an alleged conspiracy to stop the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center because the Georgia Attorney General’s office lacked authority to bring the charges. 
Georgia law specifies the circumstances when the Attorney General’s office may engage in criminal prosecution that might otherwise be handled by a local district attorney. To prosecute charges under Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, the attorney general’s office must seek authorization from the governor’s office. Deputy Attorney General John Fowler acknowledged that step had not been taken. 
However, Fowler argued that it was not required due to a state agency, the Georgia State Patrol, being a victim in two acts that the prosecution claims are related to the alleged conspiracy – a 2020 fire at a Georgia State Patrol building that the prosecution claims was set by protesters and the 2023 shooting of a Georgia State Patrol trooper in the South River Forest near the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. A protester, Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, was killed by the Georgia State Patrol in the same incident. 
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer was unconvinced that these two incidents gave the attorney general’s office jurisdiction without the governor’s authorization. Farmer said the 2020 fire alone does not give the attorney general’s office authority to pursue the racketeering charges. He additionally noted that while the 2023 shooting is mentioned in the indictment, it is not claimed to be an act that furthered the alleged conspiracy to stop construction of the training center.  
Gov. Brian Kemp praised the indictments at the time. 
“I think it would have been real easy to ask the governor, let me do this, give me a letter,” Farmer said from the bench Tuesday. “The mechanisms were in place. And the steps just weren’t followed. It’s not that he couldn’t have gotten that letter, there are mechanisms in place whereby he could have brought this.” 
Tuesday’s hearing dealt another blow to the indictment following a difficult hearing for the prosecution on Monday. Farmer compared parts of the indictment to a “bad political science paper” and repeatedly scolded the state’s attorneys on their unfamiliarity with parts of the indictment.  
The sprawling indictment, pending since September 2023, also includes charges of domestic terrorism and arson brought against five of the 61 defendants. Court resumes Wednesday morning to discuss how, or if, Farmer will dismiss those additional charges. 
Fowler stated in court that the court’s findings are “wholly incorrect” and that the attorney general’s office intends to immediately appeal the court’s ruling once it is finalized.
The Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, often called Cop City by its opponents, formally opened in 2024 following years of protests both in the streets and in front of the Atlanta City Council. Opponents to the project have long criticized it as a symbol of what they see as an increasingly militarized police force, and on environmental grounds. Gubernatorial candidate and current Attorney General Chris Carr has long been a strong supporter of the project. 
The Southern Center for Human Rights, which paired many of the defendants in the case with an attorney through its First Amendment Lawyer Bridge program, applauded the decision.
“We are grateful for the zealous representation provided by the attorneys in this case in defense of their clients and the First Amendment right to dissent. Whether paired by the Bridge or not, SCHR depends on our colleagues in the bar willing to stand firm in the face of political repression,” Tiffany Roberts, director of the center’s public policy unit, said in a statement.
The case is believed to be the largest criminal racketeering case ever filed against protesters in U.S. history.

Pharmacies can provide boosters to individuals who qualify, but the state is awaiting a looming CDC recommendation to better understand what government insurance can cover.

Despite new federal limits on who can get a Covid-19 vaccine and the arrival of the cold and flu season, many Vermonters can still get a booster, though details surrounding Medicare reimbursement and federal recommendations remain uncertain.
In a late August post on X, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Food and Drug Administration approved Covid-19 booster shots, but only for those 65 and above or with existing health risks. 
Vermont state officials are now awaiting a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which typically guides public health directives and insurers’ coverage, for those who want to get a fall booster shot.  
“Really the best thing that I can recommend is either to go online and see if you can set up an online appointment (for a vaccine), or call pharmacies in your area to see if they’re available,” said Julie Arel, the state’s interim commissioner of health.
In Vermont, pharmacies are moving forward with administering the vaccine. Kinney Drugs and CVS have the updated Covid vaccines in stock. Pharmacies order directly from the manufacturer. Providers — doctors’ offices and other clinics — often get vaccines through the state, which is not yet able to order the vaccines from the CDC. 
Kinney Drugs’ spokesperson Alice Maggiore confirmed that the stores can administer the 2025-26 vaccines to people above 65 and individuals between 12 and 64 who attest to having one of the qualifying conditions, as outlined by the CDC. 
CVS is able to vaccinate anyone over 5 years old, who attests to eligibility under the same CDC’s preexisting conditions list, or anyone older than 65, according to a company executive, Amy Thibault. 
The underlying risks outlined by the CDC range from asthma or a smoking history to mental health disorders, like depression obesity, or physical inactivity. Patients do not need a doctor’s prescription to confirm the underlying condition at Kinney or CVS, both spokespeople said.
Typically, insurers cover vaccines received in a pharmacy. Whether some private and government insurers will be able to cover the vaccines remains uncertain. Even if people can get the vaccine by walking into a pharmacy, it’s unclear if they will have to pay for it:  “It’s a little bit mind boggling,” Arel said. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state’s largest private insurer, plans to continue to cover the vaccine for any member, at no cost and with no prior approval, said Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer. Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT intends to do so through 2026, as well. MVP, the state’s other private insurer selling plans on the marketplace, also does not anticipate changes in its vaccine coverage policy, said Elizabeth Boody, a spokesperson for the company. 
What employer-sponsored insurers and providers like Tricare, the military health system, might be able to cover, is still unclear.
Since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65, it is likely that Medicare, which covers the same age group, will cover the vaccines. Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco, told NBC News that once the FDA approves a vaccine, Medicare has the authority to cover it.
Generally a Covid vaccine undergoes three steps for approval: First the FDA authorizes the new vaccines — which it did in August. Then a panel within the CDC called ACIP (short for Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) issues a recommendation on the vaccine. It is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19, to do so. This year many are holding their breath ahead of ACIP’s announcement, since Kennedy gutted the panel and replaced it with many vaccine skeptics. 
The state is weighing whether and how it will need to break from that typical process, and is currently exploring what Vermont statute allows for breaking with that process.
While it is quite common for providers to prescribe a drug outside of what the FDA has authorized them for, it’s not typical, however, for that to happen with vaccines. The FDA’s lack of formal guidance on what qualifies as an underlying condition leaves room for interpretation surrounding who qualifies for the vaccine.
“There’s some flexibility in there, but because it’s not as clear as usual, there is going to be hesitancy, in all likelihood,” said Arel. “And anytime there’s hesitancy, anytime there’s confusion, it’s going to lead to lower immunization rates. We really want to try to avoid that.”
The Department of Health is also looking to Vermont’s neighbors in the Northeast for direction, Arel said. In August, the department joined with other state health departments in the region to build a coalition ready to respond to shifts in federal guidance. Though the group has no unified recommendation, she says it’s something they are considering to help mediate the current disjunctive state of vaccine recommendations and approvals. 
“If as a region, we can become more aligned, it helps people across the whole Northeast region to feel a level of confidence in their state public health department’s decisions and how we’re moving forward,” she said.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healy required in-state insurance carriers to cover the vaccines recommended by the state’s Department of Public Health, even if they are outside of the federal recommendations. The state’s commissioner of public health also issued a standing order that allows pharmacists to issue Covid shots to anyone over the age of 5. 
In response, Arel said Vermont is watching its neighbors and looking into where state statute might allow for potential action. 
“Getting clarity and having a message be clear and simple, is going to be the most important thing we do,” Arel said. “Unfortunately, we are still working through all of that, but we are committed to finding our way through it and making it as simple and easy as possible.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Days before sentencing, a federal judge threw out three charges against former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren but kept more than a dozen convictions in place, according to news reports.
In a phone hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson determined prosecutors failed to prove that Casada and Cothren were guilty of public corruption and operated as agents of the government, the reports show. 
Casada remains convicted on 14 counts and Cothren on 16 counts after a jury found them guilty in May of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering. One fraud conviction alone comes with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Their attorneys requested a new trial and acquittal just days before their Friday sentencing.
Richardson acquitted them of a count of fraudulently obtaining state property; Casada on a count of soliciting and receiving bribes from programs receiving federal money and Cothren abetting him; and one count of Cothren offering and giving bribes and kickbacks and Casada abetting him, according to the report.
Attorneys for Casada and Cothren requested a mistrial during the four-week proceeding that stretched from mid-April into May after prosecutors inadvertently played an unredacted recording of an FBI interview with Casada that incriminated Cothren.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Parents, educators and anti-hunger advocates gathered at a community farm in Lakewood on Tuesday to launch a campaign in support of two Colorado ballot measures that would fully fund a voter-approved universal school meals program.
Propositions LL and MM would shore up funding for the Healthy School Meals For All program, which was created by Colorado voters in 2022 but has exceeded cost projections in its first years of operation. Referred to voters by the state Legislature, the two propositions are the only statewide measures that will appear on Coloradans’ ballots in the off-year election in November.
“We’re here today because we believe that children shouldn’t have to worry about the cost of lunch, or not having access to one because their family can’t afford afford to pay for it,” said Erika Cervantes, director of organizing and community partnerships for Hunger Free Colorado.

Colorado voters approved Proposition FF in 2022 to create the school meals program, which provides free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of family income. It was funded by limiting income tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 per year. The measure authorized the state to collect up to $100 million in new revenue through this reduced deduction.​ A 1992 constitutional amendment known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights​ requires tax hikes to be approved by voters.
The program’s funding mechanism raised more than expected in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, but its costs also exceeded projections, resulting in a budget gap that rose to roughly $50 million this year. Proposition LL would allow the state to keep $12 million in excess revenue that would otherwise be returned to voters under TABOR.
Proposition MM aims to permanently fund the full program by raising an additional $95 million annually for the program through further limits on tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 a year. Earners in that high-income category would pay an average of $486 more in income taxes yearly.










We’re here today because we believe that children shouldn't have to worry about the cost of lunch, or not having access to one because their family can't afford afford to pay for it.


– Erika Cervantes, director of organizing and community partnerships, Hunger Free Colorado


Enrollment in school meal programs grew by 30% or more in many school districts in the program’s first year of operation, exceeding expectations and leading to the budget shortfall. The gap has caused delays in implementing two supplementary programs that were also promised in Proposition FF — grants for purchasing locally grown food from Colorado farmers and increased wages for cafeteria workers — but advocates say the enrollment numbers underline the need for the program.
“We hear from our members around the state that the impact of Healthy School Meals For All has lived up to all the hopes and dreams we had for the program,” said Shannon Thompson, public policy and legislative chair for the Colorado School Nutrition Association. “No child has to face being stigmatized as poor when lining up for healthy meals. No child has to worry about whether or not there is money in their account as they approach each year. No child has to rush out the door in the morning hungry and not know where their next meal will be.”
Keep Kids Fed Colorado, an issue committee registered in support of Propositions LL and MM, has reported $150,000 in contributions, mostly from Hunger Free Colorado. The campaign touts a long list of endorsements from ogranizations including Children’s Hospital Colorado, Great Education Colorado, Mi Familia Vota, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and Save the Children Action Network.
In last month’s special legislative session, Colorado lawmakers passed a bill that tweaked Proposition MM, allowing the additional revenue to be spent on broader efforts to reduce food insecurity, once the Healthy School Meals For All program’s costs are covered. That would help the state partially offset the impact — estimated at up to $170 million annually — of reduced funding and higher administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a result of cuts passed by congressional Republicans this year.
“This summer, Congress slashed billions of dollars for programs that help families put food on the table,” said Jen Frankel, a parent who organizes a weekly food pantry for students and families at Denver South High School. “If voters do not turn out in November, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans, including children, older people and people with disabilities, will be in danger of going hungry.”

The purchase and renovation of multiple buildings on the college green will allow the school to expand enrollment, the school's executive director said.

This story by Matthew Thomas was first published in The Bridge on Sept. 9, 2025.
After past programmatic moves that it acknowledged can disrupt student learning, The New School of Montpelier is setting down solid roots on the college green in Montpelier. 
With last year’s purchase of Bishop-Hatch Hall at 41 College Street and Alumnx Hall at 45 College Street from the Vermont College of Fine Arts, The New School can create “stable places” for students, according to Elias Gardener, the school’s executive director. 
Gardener noted that The New School’s students “often are diagnosed with autism or have experienced trauma and are extremely dependent on predictable consistency.” 
The New School of Montpelier, a worker co-operative, is a Vermont Therapeutic School approved by the State Board of Education, Gardener said, with its tuition set by the Vermont Agency of Education. The school was founded in 2005 for 16 children with “complex challenges in central Vermont foster care homes,” whose educational needs the local public schools could not meet. “All of our students receive special education services identified on Individual Education Programs and placed by public schools.” 
The school has occupied the lower floors of Bishop-Hatch Hall since 2009 and Almunx Hall since 2013, Gardener said. He added that currently there are three programs running on the college green. The purchase and renovation of these buildings will allow the school to expand enrollment, which is very much needed, he added, because the school has more referrals than it can accommodate at the moment. 
“Both are historic buildings,” Gardener said, noting that Bishop-Hatch was built in 1958 and Alumnx Hall in 1932 and that each had “significant deferred maintenance needs.”
The New School started its restoration with Bishop-Hatch Hall. The extensive project, reviewed by the Vermont Division of Historic Preservation includes stabilization maintenance, such as replacing the roof and the original steam heat system. In addition, there will be safety updates, such as removing asbestos and installing new ventilation and sprinkler systems. 
To increase student space, Gardener said the two lower floors are being renovated to make classrooms, which, upon completion, will allow The New School to add an additional program with the capacity to take up to ten more students. “We consistently have a multi-year waiting list with staffing and space being the two primary barriers to meeting the needs of the public schools,” he said. 
Gardener anticipates renovations to Bishop-Hatch Hall to be completed in March, 2026. 
The New School is planning a future fundraising campaign to restore Almunx Hall, which needs a new roof after having shingles sheared off in high winds and leaks in the cupola, he said, adding that the school hopes to make this repair in 2026. In addition, Gardener said the steam heating system needs to be replaced. The school also does not have the funding to restore the upper two floors of Bishop-Hatch Hall. “We are considering various options including conversion to housing, but for now they must be mothballed until they can be brought up to code,” said Gardener. 
“The New School is proud to be a steward of these historic buildings, particularly Alumnx Hall,” Gardner said. He added that it is important to the school to keep the hall open for community events and that the school uses the auditorium as a gymnasium and also a “vocational learning opportunity” for students involved in event set up and support, such as weddings. 
“There are so many exciting things the new owners of various buildings on the college green and Montpelier are doing,” Gardener said. “I love being a part of it.”

(Courtesy photo)Two-term Santa Fe school board member Sarah Boses on Monday announced her candidacy as a Democrat for the New Mexico House of Representatives, District 50, which covers parts of Santa Fe and Sandoval counties, including the communities of Eldorado, Galisteo, Madrid, Placitas and Edgewood. 
The seat opened up after Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) in June announced he would not run for re-election in 2026, and would instead make a bid for Commissioner of Public Lands. Boses is the only candidate in the race so far, according to Secretary of State records.
In an interview with Source NM, Boses, who also lives in Galisteo with her family, said she has been closely watching the state House Democrats for the last year and feels inspired by their leadership on protecting vulnerable families facing federal cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“Because of where we are politically at a national scale, I don’t want to sit at home and just assume that everything’s going to be OK,” Boses said. “I think there’s important work that’s been done and there’s a lot more to do.”
When the government works as intended, she noted, “it’s easy to go about our day-to-day lives and not be paying attention to things as closely. But I believe that democracy is under attack and being undermined, and so I can’t just sit back and hope that everything will be OK.” That’s not to say that she thinks being in the Legislature is “about fighting against Donald Trump…the work is about making life better for New Mexicans and doing the things that we can do as a state to protect democracy here.” As example, she praised the privacy protections lawmakers previously enacted for reproductive and gender-affirming health care providers and patients.
“We need to hold the line and make sure those things aren’t undermined,” she said.
Voters in 2023 re-elected Boses in a three-way race to a second term on the Santa Fe Public Schools Board of Education. Boses said she has not run for any other political office. Her school board term ends in December 2027; she intends to finish her term if she wins the legislative seat and takes office in January of that year.
Other key issues for Boses include education, housing, health care generally, economic development and climate resiliency, according to her campaign announcement.
A registered nurse who specializes in oncology, Boses said she isn’t working as a nurse presently “because of how challenging the health care system is and when decisions are made by people, whether those are executives in hospital systems or lawmakers who have never done that work.”
“Decisions are best made when people affected are at the table,” she said.
Boses said she worked as McQueen’s district legislative aide for nine months.
McQueen told Source NM on Tuesday it is a possibility that he will endorse her.
“I haven’t officially endorsed her but I think she would be great for the position,” McQueen said. “She’s a great person; she’s got great experience. I’m delighted that she’s running.”
Boses said the idea of running for the House came from a conversation she had with a friend over the summer about her experience watching floor debates and committee hearings.
“Are you discouraged or are you excited?” Boses recalls the friend asking her.
“I think I’m inspired,” she replied. “There’s a lot of folks who I can see are doing hard work. Maybe that’s something that I could bring my voice, experience and perspective to.”

(Photos by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch; logo via Iowa Board of Regents)State universities are once again asking for no increase in general university funding for the upcoming fiscal year, with the University of Iowa and Iowa State University staying the course they ran last year and the University of Northern Iowa falling in line with them after their requested raise was denied last legislative session.
If their requests are approved by the Iowa Board of Regents at its Sept. 18 meeting and honored by the state, the UI would receive nearly $223.5 million, ISU would receive more than $178.4 million and UNI would receive close to $101.9 million, totaling more than $503.8 million, all in general university funding for fiscal year 2027.
Both the UI and ISU requested flat general university funding for fiscal year 2026, which they received, but UNI requested $2.5 million in incremental funding to differentiate its tuition from more research-focused universities. UNI did not receive any additional funding.

According to the appropriations request report, the state’s public universities enrolled more than 70,000 students in total, more than 40% of whom came from outside of the state. The universities hand out a combined amount of around 13,000 bachelor degrees and 4,400 graduate and professional degrees each year.
“State funding for Regent higher education is a vital resource to attract students by keeping tuition affordable and allows the Regent universities to offer an extensive array of undergraduate, graduate and professional programs in support of Iowa workforce needs,” the report stated.
Funding increase requests aim at health care, agriculture ed
While universities requested no increases to general university dollars for the upcoming fiscal year, each institution asked for specific initiative funding that the report stated “represent a 1.5% increase in appropriations from the state general fund for each university.”
The University of Iowa is requesting $3.6 million to address the state’s shortage of rural physicians and train more doctors in rural medicine, according to the document. These dollars would go toward recruiting and retaining rural students studying medicine, developing a rural medicine track for medical students with “specialized curriculum and training” and form a statewide teaching network for expanded clinical training in rural areas.
Funds would also help support scholarships for students “dedicated to rural medicine” and grow the number of students graduating with advanced training in rural medicine. Currently five students each year leave the UI with this training, the document stated, and the university would like to increase that to 10 annually.
According to the report, 65 Iowa counties are categorized as “Health Professional Shortage Areas, and rural regions of the state house around 17% fewer doctors per capita than urban regions.
“The university’s rural physician program is proven to place physicians where they’re needed most, ensuring better health outcomes for underserved communities while reducing long-term healthcare costs,” the document stated.
Iowa State University is asking for a total of $3.6 million for a few different programs, some of which the university stated in the report it hopes to bring under the umbrella of its general university appropriations.
The Ames university proposed in the report that its Agriculture Experiment Station, Cooperative Extension Service and STEM workforce initiatives merge with the general university line item for appropriations requests and allocations, as they align with the university’s overall mission to provide “high-quality education, cutting-edge research and public service for Iowans.”
The bulk of requested funding for fiscal year 2027, to the tune of $3 million, would go to the Iowa Ag Tech Innovation Initiative, which the report states is “a strategic commitment to the future of Iowa farms, rural communities and statewide economy.”
ISU’s agricultural experiment station would receive $1.8 million of that funding to develop programming and support staff and faculty aimed at agricultural technology, like artificial intelligence, automation advanced sensing and more. The board document stated work from experts at ISU will result in improved practices and systems for increased efficiency and better data.
The report also included outcomes the university expects to come from the new focus on agricultural technology, including livestock production programs with improved efficiency and animal health and well-being and grain handling and processing programs that focus on safety, quality management and its uses in energy and livestock industries.
They would also target the corn and soybean industry with new systems that “emphasize system efficiency, integrated decision-making and linkages between agronomic machinery, inputs and harvest in key areas of crop productivity, nutrient-use efficiency, genetics, plant health and soil health,” according to the document.
ISU’s cooperative extension services would use $1.2 million of the requested funding to form new programs and expand existing outreach opportunities in order to bring “ag-tech innovations” to people across the state and teach on how they can be utilized to improve their work. Efforts would focus on nutrient and pest management, livestock management and AI workforce development in agriculture.
“Iowa remains a national leader in agricultural output, but continued long-term success depends on constantly improving the ability to innovate and adapt in the competitive global environment,” the report stated. “Iowa’s rural economy depends on agricultural research and innovation to maintain global competitiveness, but the full potential of innovation cannot be attained without education and adoption.”
ISU will also seek $600,000 for its veterinary diagnostic laboratory to supplement the $300,000 funding increase the state provided in fiscal year 2026 and provide additional support as the lab moves testing operations to a new facility that will increase annual operational expenses for the lab by around $3 million.
The University of Northern Iowa is seeking funding to expand recently launched programs, namely its nursing degree and neighboring state tuition initiative.
Launched in fall 2024 with a cohort of 24 students, UNI requested in the board document $600,000 for its baccalaureate degree in nursing in order to expand the program. Funding would go toward hiring additional faculty and staff and equipment purchases for students.
UNI is also asking for $1 million for its neighboring state tuition program, which was previously set to receive state funding last year before Gov. Kim Reynolds line-item vetoed the $1.5 million allocation due to an expectation of ongoing funding and questions about its impact on current students.
The Cedar Falls university launched the program with funding from its foundation in July, allowing students coming from Iowa’s six bordering states to pay in-state tuition starting in the 2025-2026 school year.
“Over 40% of UNI graduates from the states contiguous to Iowa stay in the state after graduation, joining Iowa’s workforce and adding value to Iowa’s economic development,” the document stated. “Not only will this funding open access to programs for students from the states contiguous to Iowa, but it will also increase enrollment of undergraduates ready to join the Iowa workforce upon graduation.”

File Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderA federal judge has rejected a challenge to absentee ballot restrictions implemented under a controversial measure passed in 2021, delivering a blow to one of the last ongoing lawsuits against the sweeping election law.
The law, passed as Senate Bill 202, included new provisions that prevented voter registration organizations from distributing pre-filled absentee ballot applications to voters or blank applications to any resident who had already requested an absentee ballot — as happened in 2020. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit argued that the restrictions infringed upon their First Amendment rights.
In a 50-page decision issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge J. P. Boulee upheld the law’s absentee ballot application provisions, ruling that the use of pre-filled absentee ballot applications increased confusion among voters and that the secretary of state’s office had demonstrated “interrelated compelling governmental interests” in curtailing their use.
“The prefilled absentee-ballot applications sparked confusion and concern about voter fraud, especially when the prefilled information was incorrect,” he wrote in his decision. “Voters complained or were confused about duplicate applications as well.”
The Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information, two nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations which sent out approximately 9.6 million absentee ballot request forms in Georgia ahead of the 2020 election and helped bring the lawsuit against the law, condemned the decision. Georgia had 7.6 million registered voters in 2020, according to government data.
“These provisions block important work that has proven time and time again to help the voters of Georgia,” said Tom Lopach, who serves as president and CEO of both organizations. “In the context of increasing government overreach into our elections, the Court’s decision to limit advocacy at the expense of the right to free speech is deeply concerning. We will continue to fight to protect programs that we know help eligible Georgia voters.”
The groups added that they are “reviewing the ruling and assessing our legal options.”

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who has repeatedly defended SB 202 over the course of his two terms, applauded Boulee’s ruling.
“SB 202 is about common sense: Protecting voters from confusion, making sure every vote counts once, and keeping our elections free, fair, and secure,” Raffensperger said in a statement. “The fact that the law keeps winning in court shows that Georgia is leading the way for election integrity.”
Defenders of the 2021 law also celebrated a victory earlier this year, when U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi dismissed a Biden-era Department of Justice lawsuit alleging that the sweeping election overhaul violates the federal Voting Rights Act aimed at protecting minority voters from disenfranchisement.
But other challenges to the omnibus election law, which also imposed new ID requirements on absentee voters, limited the use of ballot drop boxes, permitted mass voter eligibility challenges and — perhaps most controversially — banned distribution of food and water to voters waiting in line, are still working their way through the courts. In August, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments over the food and water provision, which Boulee blocked in 2023. A decision in that case has yet to be released.
The bill was passed during the legislative session following the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden narrowly defeated President Donald Trump in Georgia and Democrats flipped the state’s two U.S. Senate seats. Over 1.3 million Georgians cast absentee ballots in the 2020 election, which was held during the Covid-19 pandemic.

(Provided/Department of Natural Resources)After 205 years, Poinsett Bridge in South Carolina’s Upstate is getting a facelift.
The historic bridge, once part of a state road extending from Charleston to North Carolina, will close between Sept. 29 and March 31 as preservationists repair its lime mortar, replace missing stones and install a guardrail, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.
The entire 400-acre preserve surrounding the gothic-style bridge, located in Greenville County, will close during that six months to give crews space to work, the department said in a news release.
Built in 1820, the bridge was one of three included in an 11-mile segment of road running through the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Saluda Mountain Road, as it was known, was part of an ambitious state plan to bolster commerce coming into the state from the Charleston port, according to a department history of the area.
Two of the three bridges now lie beneath the Saluda Reservoir. Only Poinsett Bridge remains standing, making it the oldest surviving bridge in South Carolina, if not the entire Southeast, according to a report on the bridge’s history.
Preservation work
All that time has taken its toll, said Meg Gaillard, an archaeologist for the conservation arm of the natural resource agency. Erosion over the years allowed water to seep through the arch, “making it vulnerable to possible structural failure,” Gaillard said in an email.
Engineers and archaeologists have been eyeing the bridge for repairs since 2021, Gaillard said.
“This work is designed to ensure people will enjoy the bridge for many years to come,” she said.
When visitors return to the preserve April 1, the bridge will look a little different. Archaeologists must clean and replace the mortar in the joints of the bridge, so the whole structure will appear newer, Gaillard said.
Since the preservation work is meant to last at least another 200 years, moss and lichen that live on the bridge’s surface will have plenty of time to regrow, softening the stone and giving it that old look, she said.
History
A keystone set in the Poinsett Bridge reads, “1820,” the year of its completion.
Two years before starting construction, legislators spent $1 million — the equivalent of $25 million in today’s dollars — on a four-year economic development effort to bolster trade between Charleston’s port and the Upstate. They put the newly established Board of Public Works in charge of the initiative, which centered around building a road running from the mountains to the coastline, according to the historical report.
The bridge is named for Joel Poinsett, a former legislator and the first director of the new board who is famous for introducing the poinsettia flower to the country.
The origins of the bridge’s design, however, are more of an unknown.
No written schematics for the bridge or the road remain, making it impossible to determine for certain who made the plans.
It is the prolific American architect Robert Mills, best known for designing the Washington Monument, who often receives the credit for drawing up the bridge’s design.
Mills became the lead architect for the Board of Public Works a month after the road’s completion, according to the state’s natural resources agency.
The 19th Century architect’s distinctive combination of Palladian, Georgian and Greek Revival styles remain on view across South Carolina, including at the Robert Mills House in Columbia and the Fireproof Building in Charleston.
The question remains, though, whether the Poinsett Bridge should count among those. Some historians point to illustrations Mills made of all three bridges on the Upstate portion of the road as an indication that he was the brain behind it.
Disrepair
For 135 years, people traveled the road between the Upstate, Midlands and Lowcountry. Traffic along the road dipped over time with the development of a railroad system, the surge in popularity of cars that replaced horse-drawn buggies, and the creation of more convenient routes. Still, some affluent families continued to use the road as the most direct way out of the Lowcountry, where malaria was common during summer months, to second homes in the mountains.
The nail in the coffin for the bridge as a traveling path came in 1955, when Greenville County rerouted the road, according to the natural resources department.
For years, the bridge stood unused on private property. The construction of a nearby Boy Scout camp in the 1920s, however, brought it back into the public eye, according to the report on the bridge’s history.
Fifty years later it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, according to an application submitted at the time.
Then, in the early 2000s, the South Carolina Heritage Trust, a division of the Department of Natural Resources, stepped in. The state agency bought the bridge, along with about 120 acres, in 2003 to create a nature preserve.

(Photo by Jarvis DeBerry | Louisiana Illuminator)The number of people killed on Louisiana roads in 2024 reached its lowest level in five years, with fatality numbers dropping faster than the rest of the country, the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission announced Tuesday. 
Motor vehicle crashes in Louisiana caused 753 deaths last year, a 7.2% reduction from 2023 and a bigger decline than the national rate of 3.8%, according to data from the Center for Analytics and Research in Transportation Safety.  
Helmut Schneider, the center’s executive director, shared the new statistics in a presentation at Louisiana State University. 
Lisa Freeman, executive director of the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission, said the lower fatality rate “shows we are moving in the right direction, but we still have work to do.”
“We will not be satisfied until our rate reaches zero,” she said.
The statistics showed 88% of vehicle occupants use a seatbelt in Louisiana and a 18.3% decrease in DWI-related deaths.
While DWI deaths went down, DWI arrests increased 4.3%, to 13,675 people in 2024. The spike is “likely due to an increase in enforcement” rather than an increase in the number of drunk drivers, Schneider said.
The statistics also show an all-time low for people killed in motorcycle crashes in Louisiana, with 69 deaths. It represents a 28.9% decrease from 2023. 
However, the numbers also showed an increase in bicycle-related and pedestrian deaths, with 44 cyclists killed compared with 35 in 2023 and 161 pedestrians killed compared to 147 in 2023.

(Photo by Commonwealth Media Services)Pennsylvania corrections officers may soon be able to live outside of the state.
On Tuesday, the state Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously advanced Senate Bill 111, which would authorize the hiring and promotion of out-of-state residents as COs by the Department of Corrections.
“There are few jobs… (as) stressful as a corrections officer, working day and night, weekends, holidays, to protect all of us, as well as the inmates and their colleagues,” said Sen. David Argall (R-Schuylkill), who authored the proposal.
Argall said he believes eliminating the residency requirement would address staffing shortages. He said the shortages have resulted in more challenges for corrections officers, including mandatory overtime, increased stress, and violence.
State Department of Corrections (DOC) Sec. Laurel R. Harry announced in February that the vacancy rate for corrections officers was 4.8% by the end of January. She credited targeted recruitment efforts as a result in the vacancy rate dropping from 10.5% in late 2022.
There are 23 state prisons in Pennsylvania, including two in Argall’s district, Frackville and Mahanoy. They are both in Schuylkill County.
He said he met with the leadership of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA), who support the proposal.
“And since many of our corrections facilities are located close to the border, we believe that this would provide immediate relief,” Argall said.
Rep. Clint Owlett (R-Tioga) authored House Bill 1968 in the previous session, which also aimed to eliminate the residency requirement for corrections officers. In his co-sponsorship memo, he noted that SCI Somerset, SCI Chester, SCI Waymart and SCI Phoenix are close to bordering states.

The prohibition on cattle imports due to the New World screwworm is hitting New Mexico ports hard, according to Border Authority officials. (Photo courtesy of Daniel Manzanares)Even though about one-third of all cattle the United States imports from Mexico come through New Mexico ports of entry, investments and planning about how to stop an ongoing screwworm outbreak are happening outside of the state.
That’s according to officials with the New Mexico Border Authority, who provided an interim legislative committee Tuesday afternoon with an update on the New World screwworm infestation. Concerns about the outbreak prompted the U.S. Department of Agriculture in July to halt cattle imports from Mexico.
The prohibition on cattle imports meant a halt to a $1.3 billion industry, according to authority officials, and is hitting the Columbus, N.M. port of entry particularly hard. Mexican cattle growers ship approximately 300,000 cattle through Columbus and Santa Teresa ports of entry each year, according to the authority.
Authorities see no immediate end in sight for the outbreak, according to Gerardo Fierro, the authority’s director, and Joseph de la Rosa, the authority’s board’s chair. The onus falls on Mexican animal welfare authorities to slow northward advancement of the infestation, Fierro said, to the USDA’s satisfaction. 
The movement of the parasitic fly, previously eradicated from the U.S. for the last several decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona and Texas in the last several months. The screwworm’s name references the maggot’s behavior of burrowing into the flesh of a living animal, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage to livestock, wildlife and pets. 
Santa Teresa cattle border crossing reopening scrapped after screwworm movement in Mexico

In late August, the USDA awarded $750 million to a lab in Edinburg, Texas, to produce about 300 million sterile screwworm flies per week. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins stood alongside Texas Gov. Greg Abbott at a news conference, at which she said that the infestation “endangers our livestock industry and it threatens the stability of beef prices for consumers across America,” according to the Texas Tribune.
De la Rosa pointed to the new facility being built in Texas as an example of a missed opportunity for New Mexico. He said it’s another example of why the New Mexico Legislature needs to increase its funding for New Mexico border infrastructure.
“New Mexico was not even part of the conversation for that; we have the largest cattle crossing along the US-Mexico border; the cattle industry is important here,” he said. “But because of our lack of infrastructure and our lack of development along the border, we weren’t even, you know, in that conversation.”
The authority, which seeks to spur development at the state’s four international ports of entry, currently has a flat operating budget of about $577,000, de la Rosa said, though he and Fierro listed some multi-million-dollar capital projects they’re hoping the Legislature will fund. 
Between 2023 and 2024, the total value of all goods imported or exported across the Columbus and Santa Teresa ports of entry grew from about $28.3 billion to about $40.4 billion, according to Fierro’s presentation. The vast majority of that occurred at Santa Teresa, according to Fierro.
Even with the decrease in cattle imports, which Fierro said he’s still trying to quantify, the ports are still among the fastest-growing in the country and competitive with ports in El Paso.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cattle-Export-lots-1024x441.jpg,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

(Photo: Getty Images)The North Carolina Charter School Review Board on Tuesday reviewed a new law that expands its authority while giving charter schools more flexibility in daily operations. 
The law, which took effect in July after the Republican-led General Assembly overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, changes the way charter schools are overseen and run.
In his veto message, Stein called Senate Bill 254 “an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction.” Stein also argued the measure “weakens accountability of charter schools when every North Carolina student deserves excellent public schools, whether traditional or charter.” 
Some of the more significant changes in the law include granting the review board authority to propose, recommend and approve rules and policies for charter schools. Previously, the State Board of Education was responsible for creating the rules.
The law also gives charter schools more operational flexibility and clarifies accountability measures for low-performing schools.
Here’s what changes under the law: 

The review board now approves rules, policies and charter agreements, authority previously held by the State Board of Education. 


Schools may move within 10 miles of their current site, as long as they remain in the same district, without prior approval. Moving beyond 10 miles or across districts require the board’s approval.


Schools can develop their own evaluation systems, as long as they align with state teaching standards.


Schools are no longer required to list class rank on student transcripts. Some board members welcomed the change, noting that rank often pressures students into course choices aimed at boosting their standing.
 Remote academies with 250 or more students can apply for a separate charter under an expedited process, and they will receive their own school performance grade

According to Sander[...]","Arkansas National Guardsmen and central Arkansas law enforcement officers completed required training on Aug. 2, 2025 at Burns Park. (Courtesy of the Arkansas National Guard)Up to 40 Arkansas National Guard members will assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in apprehending migrants at risk of deportation under the federal Title 32 program, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Tuesday.
The federally-funded initiative will enlist up to 27 Air National Guard Airmen and 13 Army National Guard soldiers. According to Sanders’ news release, 18 guardsmen will be assigned in Little Rock, 10 in Fort Smith, 10 in Fayetteville and two at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock.
Guardsmen will not be armed and will instead help ICE agents transport, process and detain individuals lacking permanent legal status, the release states.
The Guardsmen involved in the initiative have Title 32 status, meaning they are federally funded but serve under the command of the governor of their state or territory.
“Violent, criminal illegal immigrants have no place in Arkansas,” Sanders said in Tuesday’s news release. “…I look forward to our guardsmen working with the Trump Administration to enforce federal immigration law.”
Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas’ adjutant general, expressed support for the initiative in the news release, saying the National Guard is “highly trained and committed to enabling federal agents to focus on their core operations.”
American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Dickson called the initiative “an abuse of power that jeopardizes Arkansans’ rights and safety” in a news release from the organization.
“Through this manufactured emergency, Governor Sanders is not making Arkansas safer — she is stoking fear, scapegoating immigrants, inviting racial profiling and undermining the rule of law,” Dickson said. “Immigrant families are part of our communities, our congregations, our schools and our workplaces. Treating them as enemies to be rounded up and detained is un-American and unacceptable.”
US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower court’s ban on ICE agents’ racial profiling of Latinos in Southern California. The region has seen protests in recent months over ICE’s actions in response to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented migrants.
Sanders sent 80 National Guardsmen to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas in 2023 and sent 40 the following year, both times with the goal of assisting federal immigration authorities. Other Republican governors have made similar efforts.
This year, Sanders signed the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. The law established harsher penalties for migrants who commit violent felonies in the state, and it required Arkansas law enforcement agencies to participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, which deputizes them to help apprehend and deport migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
In August, the Arkansas National Guard formally requested authority to make immigration arrests under the “task force model” of the 287(g) program. National Guard soldiers typically do not serve a law enforcement role.
The task force model is one of three 287(g) programs offered by ICE to local law enforcement agencies that impart limited degrees of immigration enforcement powers. The first, the warrant service officer model, allows trained law enforcement agencies to serve immigration warrants to those already in local jails. The jail enforcement model allows local law enforcement to identify and process those it believes are in the country illegally that are brought into the jail.

Vermont’s Department of Health confirmed the state’s first-known human case of the mosquito-borne Jamestown Canyon virus. The disease has relatively mild symptoms, especially for young people who do not have underlying health conditions.
The state began monitoring mosquitoes for Jamestown Canyon Virus this year, after it was found in nearby states. The monitoring showed insects in Rutland, Marshfield and Whitingham all carried the disease. This human case, which was confirmed in a Sept. 8 lab test in a Windsor County patient, further confirms the presence of the virus in Vermont, according to Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian.
“It is a good indicator and reminder, just like anytime we find the virus in mosquitoes, to continue to take precautions against mosquito bites,” Kwit said.
Mosquitoes become infected when they bite animals — particularly deer — carrying the virus. They then spread it to other animals and people when they bite them. Humans are “dead end hosts,” meaning that the viral load people receive from an infected mosquito bite is too low to spread to other people.
It also means that many people with the virus never experience symptoms, while others can develop flu-like symptoms, such as fevers, headaches, chills and aches. People with compromised immune systems and older people are more at risk for more severe symptoms — for some, more serious disease could escalate to confusion and discoordination, stiffness and seizure. About half of people who do become symptomatic get hospitalized, according to the Department of Health. 
The best way to prevent infection is to prevent mosquito bites in the first place. The Department of Health recommends limiting time outside during dusk and dawn when the insects are most active, wearing long sleeves and insect repellent, and covering windows, doors, playpens and strollers with tight mosquito nets or screens. The department also advises people to clear any standing water that may accumulate in things like pots, buckets or children’s outdoor toys.
In late summer, the risk for mosquito-borne illnesses increases, Kwit said, since there has been more time for the virus to circulate in hosts and mosquitoes. The risk remains — and the state plans to continue monitoring mosquitoes — until the first fall frost. 
The state also tests the collected mosquito samples for West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis — or EEE — virus, as it has in years past. There have been no confirmed cases of either in a human this year.
“We’re just learning about this virus, too,” Kwit said of Jamestown Canyon virus. “We’ve only just started actively testing for it in mosquitoes we collect in Vermont, so over time, we’ll get an understanding of where we’re finding it, as we’re gathering more evidence.”

Free.,US Supreme Court sets Trump tariffs case arguments for November,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-sets-trump-tariffs-case-arguments-november,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in early November on whether President Donald Trump’s emergency tariffs are legal, according to an order the court released Tuesday.The one-page unsigned order laid out an expedited timeline, which the administration had requested, for the consolidated legal challenges brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general.A U.S. appeals court sided with the businesses and state officials late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court’s ruling in May finding Trump’s unprecedented use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to trigger global tariffs violated the Constitution.The justices’ acceptance of the case is the latest in a string of legal challenges against the administration that have escalated to the high court since Trump took office in January. Recently the Supreme Court has handed the administration wins on immigration enforcement and withholding foreign aid.Trump began imposing wide-reaching tariffs in February and significantly broadened them in the following months on goods from around the globe after declaring national emergencies — first over illegal fentanyl smuggling, and then declaring trade deficits an emergency. A trade deficit means the U.S. imports more goods from a country than that nation’s businesses purchase from U.S. suppliers.As of July, the U.S. had collected roughly $122 billion in tariff revenue, according to a monthly tracker produced by the Peterson Institute on International Economics. Tariffs are taxes that the U.S. government collects from domestic businesses and purchasers when they import foreign goods.In the administration’s appeal to the Supreme Court to fast-track the case, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued the government would face “catastrophic” economic fallout if it had to repay businesses for the tariffs already collected, particularly if the court waited until next year to take the case.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states that challenged Trump’s emergency tariffs. The business plaintiffs include V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.",,,,2025-09-09 18:57:56.857363

Last month, the state phased out a system, started during Covid-19, that provided rides for people leaving prison. It’s only the latest change to a beleaguered judicial transport system.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
MONTPELIER — In the span of five years, the intricate web of sheriff’s deputies, prison staff and judges that orchestrated the transport of people to and from court hearings has upended.
“The whole infrastructure of our transport system that existed for 100 years doesn’t exist anymore,” Matt Valerio, Vermont’s defender general, told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
The Joint Legislative Justice Oversight Committee, composed of Vermont legislative committee leaders and other lawmakers, were discussing the nagging issue, which returned to the spotlight in late August. At that time, the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs decided to stop transporting people released from the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, phasing out entirely a practice that had been cut due to a lack of resources. 
Instead, people would leave the rural prison on foot, left to find their way.
While issues like rising crime and criminal justice reform tend to attract more legislative and media attention, the bureaucratic underpinnings of the legal and carceral systems, like prisoner transports, have a quieter but daily impact on those navigating them. Spurred by Covid-19 practices and fewer transport resources, the state has increasingly relied on virtual court hearings as a solution. Valerio and others have decried that switch as jeopardizing the rights of criminal defendants.

Post-release transports — the type the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs began during Covid and ended last month — make up a small fraction of the work conducted by state-paid transport deputies, according to Tim Lueders-Dumont, the department’s executive director. 
Scarcely more than 200 of the 4,000 rides these deputies provided last year were for people leaving prison, he told lawmakers on Tuesday. But cutting the rides reveals the fraying and overburdened system. 
Before the pandemic, the Vermont Department of Corrections provided occasional post-release transports. And when sheriffs had more resources, their overall volume of rides was far larger. According to Lueders-Dumont, the hours that county-paid deputies, rather than state-paid, have spent providing judicial transports has dropped from about 20,000 to 3,000, while the state-paid level has remained consistent at about 20,000 hours annually. 
“We are feeling so pinched,” he said.

So thin is the department’s staffing, Lueders-Dumont said, that he’s had to sometimes push back at judges’ transport orders, asking them to reconsider the need. He joked that he’s so far avoided being held in contempt of court — but only narrowly. 
When people are released from Vermont’s rural prisons onto the streets, they will do what they need to do to survive, Valerio told lawmakers. In rare past instances, that’s meant starting fires to stay warm, he said. 
To fix the decayed transport system, Valerio urged lawmakers to increase funding for both more sheriff’s transport deputies and for Department of Corrections transport staff. At the same time, he recommended restricting the use of remote arraignments — the first hearings in a criminal case — so that when people are released, they’re in their home county rather than a prison in another part of the state. 
But money may be hard to come by. Last year, Lueders-Dumont asked the Legislature to fund six new transport staff. Instead, he received only an extra unfunded position. And this year, the House’s budget writers are warning their peers it will be a penny-pinching session, driven by federal cuts.

Some of those detained, including Kilmar Abrego Garica, of Maryland, whose mistaken deportation captured national attention, detailed psychological and physical torture. No protection from tortureThe document was obtained through a lawsuit by Democracy Forward, which specifically argued the financial agreement between El Salvador and the U.S. “was created without any legal basis.” “The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”  That case is being overseen by District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg, who also ordered the Trump administration to turn around planes carrying men removed under the wartime law.

Kevin Stitt’s removal of homeless camps in Tulsa will be an ongoing process and could expand to other areas of the state, an Oklahoma Highway Patrol official said Tuesday.
As of mid-Monday, the Highway Patrol had helped remove about 30 encampments and about a dozen more had been identified, said Lt. Mark Southall. One particular camp was a mile long, he said.
Some of the camps have been around for years, Southall said.
“Once we get these camps that are by the roadways on state property cleaned up, we’re going to have to continue to go back and check on these camps and make sure there’s not people living in them,” he said.
Late last week, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he had launched Swift Action for Families Everywhere, or “Operation SAFE,” in an effort to end homelessness in Tulsa by dismantling camps on state property. Stitt’s campaign was launched without consulting Tulsa’s mayor. 
Initially, OHP issued warnings to homeless individuals. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation posted notices at encampments on state property telling individuals to vacate the area.
On Friday, OHP and other state agencies began clearing out the encampments. They offered homeless individuals a ride to a treatment or housing facility or a trip to jail if they refused.
As of Tuesday, Southall said troopers encountered hundreds of homeless individuals. About 600,000 pounds of trash and debris have been removed from encampments, he said.
The operation has involved between 20 and 25 troopers, he said.
Troopers approached the operation with compassion for those involved, Southall said.
“Knowing these people have lived in some of these camps for over 10 years and that moving was going to be hard for them – we had no problems,” he said. “Almost everybody that we dealt with was cooperative to the point we didn’t have to make any arrests.”
One person accepted an offer for services, said Sarah Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.
Stewart said one person’s dog had been shot after lunging at an officer. The dog was taken for treatment.
Southall said the dog later died.
The camps have become a public safety issue, Southall said. 
Some homeless people are involved in automobile-pedetrian collisions, he said.
“It’s sad enough they are homeless,” Southall said. “It’s even worse if they get hit by a car and die.”
In addition, homeless people build unsafe fires and have discarded bodily fluids near public waterways, he said.
Troopers have also found stolen property within the camps, Southall said.
“Our goal is to continue to check on these camps as time goes on to where people know you just can’t camp on state property or they are going to come move you away,” Southall said.
Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols on Monday said Stitt did not give notice or coordinate with local officials.
“This is somewhat of a manufactured crisis by doing it without coordination with the city,” Nichols said. “And so my great hope is that it doesn’t last long going down the road.”
Nichols said Stitt was aware that the city’s homeless shelters were over 100% capacity. 
He said the operation is having a negative impact on public safety. In addition, it has undermined the relationships local law enforcement and others have cultivated with the homeless population, he said.
Nichols said the city has been working to reduce homelessness and provide affordable housing.
“Progress sometimes is not as fast as some people would like it to be, but progress does not look like a bunch of Instagram and Twitter videos that, frankly, tell not even half of the story,” Nichols said.
Nichols was referring to Stitt’s use of social media showing the removal of debris and items left behind.

(Submitted)TOPEKA — A southeast Kansas farmer, veterinarian and veteran is running for Congress because he is “increasingly alarmed at the direction this administration is heading.”
Don Coover, a Democrat and political newcomer, is challenging Republican Derek Schmidt, who currently holds the 2nd District seat. Coover wants to see a more inclusive, solutions-oriented government and country, he said.
“I think we, as a country, are becoming more and more authoritarian, less and less tolerant of each other, and less willing to seek solutions to problems we all see through slightly different lenses,” he said.
The focus of his campaign largely revolves around the pocketbook. Tariffs are harming the agriculture industry, Coover said. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is piling on trillions to the national debt, he said, “and if we don’t do anything about it, people like my granddaughter are going to be left to clean up the mess.”
He said he is also concerned about the availability and sustainability of rural hospitals.
“If you get your arm torn off in a hay baler or your kid spikes a high fever, you shouldn’t have to drive four hours to get to an ER,” Coover said. “We’ve got to get our health care system working for people, not insurance companies.”
Coover is a West Point graduate, and he later earned a degree from Kansas State University’s veterinary medicine school. In between, he was a U.S. Army military intelligence pilot in Korea.
Coover helps run the family business, raising Wagyu beef on a southeast Kansas ranch “built on science, legacy, and the belief that truly great beef begins long before the plate,” the company’s website says. He also owns a Galesburg-based company offering routine veterinary and health management services for cattle, along with cattle embryo transfer and in vitro fertilization.
Coover lives on a ranch in Galesburg with his wife. He has two stepchildren and a granddaughter. His campaign office is headquartered in Pittsburg, according to federal campaign filing records.
“Any sane person can see how broken politics is these days. When something is broken, something has to be done to fix it,” Coover said. “I’ve always been one of the guys who would do the jobs that had to get done, but no one else wanted to do. We need less career politicians making decisions in Washington and more folks who are used to putting in a hard day of work.”
Kansas’ 2nd District stretches from the state’s southeast border to its northeast corner, meandering around Johnson, Miami, Franklin and Anderson counties, through parts of Douglas and Wyandotte counties and as far west as Marion County. Schmidt won the district in 2024, defeating Democrat Nancy Boyda by more than 57,000 votes. Kansas has one Democratic congressional delegate, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of the state’s 3rd District. Each of the state’s U.S. House seats and one U.S. Senate seat are up for reelection in 2026.
Coover filed paperwork to run for Congress on Aug. 25. He is beginning his campaign while his opponent has a more than $260,000 lead, according to campaign records. Coover said he is focused on getting his message out to people across his district and doing “the right things for Kansans and our country.”
“Compare that to Rep. Schmidt, who’s been running for and been in elected office for the past 25 years. He’s part of the career politicians who are more focused on doing what their party leaders want them to do,” Coover said. “I think people are ready for new voices.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Don-Coover-headshot-scaled-e1757454292948-1024x577.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

New Mexico Democratic leaders decried the Sept. 8, 2025 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court which lifted a lower court’s ban on immigration agents’ racial profiling in Southern California. (U.S. Department of Homeland Security) Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation and the state’s top attorney decried Monday’s U.S. Supreme Court decision, which lifted a lower court’s ban of federal immigration agents’ racial profiling practices of Spanish-speaking workers in Southern California.
The order is temporary as the suit proceeds through the lower courts. But the majority of justices concluded that officers could use individuals’ “apparent ethnicity” as one factor for reasonable suspicion to justify search and seizure, noting that other factors could be the type of labor being performed or not speaking English.
US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement

New Mexico’s Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, condemned the ruling in Spanish and English from the House floor Monday, saying it “condemns millions of Latinos to live in fear” of being detained.
“This is the racism that goes hand in hand with facism,” Leger Fernandez said in Spanish.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez called the decision a “grave insult to the people of New Mexico” in a statement released Tuesday.
“Our state has the highest proportion  of Latinos in the nation  — many of them, like me, American citizens whose families have lived in New Mexico for generations,” Torrez said. “This unconscionable decision, which ignores our Constitutional rights, makes us second-class citizens in our own country.”

Torrez said the New Mexico Constitution protects people from “racial profiling by state, county and municipal law enforcement,” and that New Mexico law enforcement is required to follow the state law. He urged anyone who believes they were racially profiled to contact the New Mexico Department of Justice.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in a statement that he will “fight like hell,” to protect New Mexico freedoms.
“President Trump, Congressional Republicans, and now the radical majority of the Supreme Court believe it’s okay to stop and detain anyone – including Americans – because of how they look, speak, or where they are. This is morally wrong and un-American,” Heinrich said. “Nowhere in the United States of America should anyone be detained for the way they look or how they speak. It doesn’t matter what job they work or where they are in their hometown.”

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The former Michigan speaker of the House of Representatives, now a candidate for governor in 2026, said Tuesday that the federal government should investigate Attorney General Dana Nessel for the abuse of her office following a Lansing judge’s decision to dismiss charges against 15 individuals accused of conspiring to help President Donald Trump’s campaign overturn the results of the 2020 election.
Tom Leonard, who was Nessel’s opponent in the 2018 race that saw her elected to the post, joined several other Republicans across the state in cheering the decision issued today by Lansing 54-A District Judge Kristen Simmons. 
The cacophony of celebration included two Republicans who were linked to the case by the special investigator in charge. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Simmons, in a decision from the bench, concluded there wasn’t sufficient evidence to prove that the 15 individuals, charged with a host of forgery and conspiracy crimes, had criminal intent when they allegedly signed documents certifying Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump. 
That led Simmons to dismiss the charges and she did not order the cadre to be bound over for trial.
During the course of the case, Simmons heard one of several preliminary examinations for the group in April 2024. It was then that Leonard and his wife, Jenell Leonard, who owns the Lansing-based Marketing Resource Group, were said to be among those whom Special Investigator Howard Shock identified as unindicted co-conspirators in the case. The list of unindicted co-conspirators included former Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox and Republican strategist Stu Sandler.
Shock also confirmed President Donald Trump, as well as Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani; former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; Chris Velasco, who worked with Trump’s campaign in Michigan; and Kenneth Chesebro, who pleaded guilty in Georgia for helping to organize the fake electors plot across seven states including Michigan, were among the list of unindicted co-conspirators 
As Simmons dismissed the charges Tuesday, Leonard issued a statement slamming Nessel for pursuing the case. 
“Today, justice finally prevailed. This confirms what Jenell and I have maintained from the very beginning; this case was without merit, politically motivated, and driven not by justice, but by an attorney general intent on scoring political points,” Leonard wrote.“The judge’s dismissal is a complete vindication, and I am grateful that our names, along with President Trump, have been cleared.”

He accused Nessel of repeatedly abusing her station, calling her “the most reckless attorney general in the country,” and asked for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate her office.
Nessel’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Leonard’s call for a federal investigation.
The attorney general has been a frequent critic of Trump’s, and has pursued several cases tied to his false claim that he won the 2020 election, and his assertion that the election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence to support that claim. 
The attorney general has also received criticism from Republicans for the more than 30 cases she has led or joined challenging the Trump administration over a host of federal actions from the president, including an attempt to pause federal funding to state governments. 
Other GOP governor hopefuls weigh in
Leonard wasn’t the only Republican gubernatorial candidate to weigh in on the decision.
Former Attorney General Mike Cox called the case “another example of lawfare and the Fake-News media trying to destroy anyone that doesn’t agree with their opinions.”
“Good on Judge Simmons to stand up to the Democrat machine and demand due process,” Cox said in a post on social media.
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt shared an image of a fake book that TV host Jimmy Kimmel joked about ghost-writing for the president during his 2016 campaign.
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) took his criticism further, accusing Michigan Democrats of eroding the judicial system and imperiling the republic.
“While Michigan’s affordability and education decline, they waste taxpayer funds for political vendettas, James said in a post on social media. “As governor, I will expose their misconduct and restore blind justice to our state.” 
Nessel, however, raised similar concerns about Trump and his supporters during a virtual news conference held after the decision. 
“For many when it is this President and this President’s followers, then there is no criminal activity, no action nefarious enough to warrant consequences of any kind, especially when it comes to rigging the system in Trump’s favor,” Nessel said. “We see it in the courts in real time today, as judges in Michigan and across the nation hem and haw over these election related cases, and it’s getting harder and harder to even get an election case across the finish line, let alone to get them in a timely decision where perhaps it would have made a difference.” 
The attorney general raised further concerns about judges facing threats and fear of retaliation when handling cases related to the president.
Nessel also remained steadfast in her decision to bring charges against the 15 defendants.
“When I complete my time in this office, I will forever believe that issuing these charges and filing these cases was the righteous, proper, appropriate and legally compelled thing to do by my role as state attorney general, and I feel certain that history will vindicate that decision,” Nessel said.

The vote, which was unanimous, comes after a hearing the PSC held in New Albany last week over Holly Springs’ long troubled power provider. At the hearing, the commission made two decisions: to declare that the city had “failed to provide reasonably adequate service,” violating state law, and to petition a chancery judge to place the utility into a receivership.
Holly Springs’ utility department serves about 12,000 customers in north Mississippi, most of whom live outside the city limits.

Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown, whose constituency includes Holly Springs, explained the PSC has discretion over how often and how long to impose the fines, as well as how often the city has to pay what’s owed. For instance, Brown said, if the utility does end up in a third party’s hands or being bought, the PSC can end the fines.
Money from the fines, he added, would go to the state’s general fund. Brown said the PSC could then request the Legislature to appropriate those dollars back to whoever is running the utility. 
“This problem has been decades in the making,” he said during Tuesday’s monthly docket meeting. 
Brown also noted allegations that Holly Springs has misappropriated funds meant to be reinvested into the utility. Those claims are at the center of a lawsuit the Tennessee Valley Authority, which sells power to the city, filed against Holly Springs earlier this year. 
Central District Public Service Commissioner De’Keither Stamps asked his colleagues where the money for fines would come from, before concluding they’d likely have to come from Holly Springs taxpayers. Stamps also said the city took steps Monday to address recommendations made by Silverpoint Consulting in a July report.
“Does that not signal to this body that the entity is making appropriate steps to improve the system?” Stamps asked.

Brown responded that the city has had plenty of chances already, and that the fines are meant to motivate local leaders. 
“The people in that district have obviously been suffering under a system that has failed them for decades,” he said. “Although we appreciate their moving to rectify this, that’s exactly why this penalty is being levied, to make sure they understand not providing adequate service is not going to be tolerated by this body.”
Mississippi Today reached out to Holly Springs’ mayor and city attorney and did not hear back before publication. 
Fines from the PSC would just add onto recent financial challenges for the small city of just around 7,000 people. In August, Mississippi Today reported that the state auditor’s office diverted $450,000 of Holly Springs’ sales tax revenue — or roughly half of the city’s yearly total — for past-due audits.
The city’s median income is around $47,000 and its poverty rate is about one in four, census data shows. Both figures are worse than the rest of the state’s.
Talking to Mississippi Today after the meeting, Brown said while he understands the city may have trouble paying the fines, the idea is to compel action from local leaders such as selling off parts of or all of its service area to a neighboring electric cooperative.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185719/3X0A1847-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Free.,RFK Jr. lists 100+ recommendations to ‘Make America Healthy Again’,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-lists-100-recommendations-make-america-healthy-again,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released its strategy to Make America Healthy Again on Tuesday, which officials hope will reduce chronic diseases and align federal policy with their beliefs. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a briefing on the strategy the 128 “recommendations are things that I've been dreaming about my whole life.”Kennedy said he hoped to implement several of the changes before the end of the year, including defining what constitutes an ultra-processed food, updating water quality standards for forever chemicals known as PFAS and changing infant formula standards. The report also includes potentially controversial elements that address access to vaccines, a topic several Republican senators rebuked Kennedy over during a lengthy hearing last week. The 20-page strategy follows the MAHA Commission’s release of its first report in May that outlined four areas of concern — nutrition, physical activity, environmental factors and “overmedicalization.”The proposals in the new report range in scope from issues that have largely been addressed to initiatives that are likely to cause concerns among doctors and reputable medical organizations. For example, the strategy calls on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to “develop guidance on diagnostics and treatments for food allergies,” even though doctors are already able to diagnose and treat those conditions. The report also calls on the FDA to “improve regulatory processes for over-the-counter sunscreen, which has fallen behind other countries.”Vaccine plan to comeThe White House Domestic Policy Council and HHS intend to draft a separate plan addressing the childhood vaccine schedule, vaccine injuries, vaccine science, “misaligned incentives” and “scientific and medical freedom.”Kennedy indicated during the briefing that he may seek to overhaul the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, claiming that 99% of vaccine injuries are not reported, in part, because doctors are not compensated for doing so.  “We are recasting the entire program so that vaccine injuries will be reported; they will be studied; that individuals who suffer them will not be denied, or marginalized, or vilified, or gaslighted,” Kennedy said. “They will be welcomed and we will learn everything we can about them.”The report doesn’t include any plans to reduce pesticide use or to seek solutions to end mass shootings, though Kennedy and others at the event said those are issues the administration will look into. “The firearms question is a complex question and it’s not an easy question,” Kennedy said. “The violence is what we’re concerned with.”Kennedy said that guns have been around for a while and that they also exist in other countries that don’t have nearly the number of mass shootings as the United States, before talking about psychiatric drugs, video games and social media. “We are looking at that at NIH,” Kennedy said, referring to the National Institutes of Health. “We are doing studies now. We’re initiating studies to look at the correlation and the potential connection between overmedicating our kids and this violence.” Kennedy deferred a question about pesticides to White House Domestic Policy Council Director Vince Haley, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. Haley referenced a section in the newly released report titled “cumulative exposure” that said USDA, EPA and NIH will use new approach methodologies “to improve methods for evaluating human health and environmental risks of chemical contaminants.”Rollins told reporters that pesticides require study before being approved and that they are needed to ensure a stable food supply. “Is it a perfect process? Arguably there is no perfect process,” Rollins said. “But it is a strong process that our farmers stand by. And a crop protection tool, such as pesticides, is absolutely essential for America not to compromise our food supply system at this point.”",,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Both said they agreed with Green.“What this bill did was create the potential for SNAP programs to no longer exist in any shape, form or fashion, in terms of providing SNAP benefits in states that could not afford to or chose not to for whatever reason, meet the cost-share,” Figures said.The three witnesses all said that was an accurate assessment of the law.New cost-shareProvisions of the law make states responsible, for the first time, for paying a share of SNAP benefits. The share that states will be responsible for depends on a state’s error payment rate — the percentage of benefit payments that are more or less than the amount that should be paid — with the federal government covering all benefit costs for states that record error rates below 6%. States with higher error rates will be responsible for more funding.Democrats argued the changes would cripple state budgeting efforts.The law also cuts funding for states to administer the program, which Angie Craig, the ranking Democrat on the full committee, said created “a perfect storm.” Reduced federal funding and expanded reporting requirements make errors more likely, while increased errors lead to even less funding, she said.“In effect, Republicans cut their resources and then punished them when overworked staff made more errors administering an increasingly complicated program,” Craig, of Minnesota, said of states. “None of these changes help reduce hunger in our communities.”Republicans defend SNAP decisionsRepublicans downplayed the impact of the law, saying that some Democrats were “fear-mongering” and that the changes would help the program’s long-term health.“Congress can no longer turn a blind eye to states that mismanage federal funds at the expense of vulnerable families,” subcommittee Chairman Brad Finstad, a Minnesota Republican, said.Wisconsin Republican Derrick Van Orden said he grew up on food stamps and wanted to see the program succeed. Requiring states with higher error rates to pay a share of the benefits was about effectively managing the program, he said.“The purpose of that is not to get people off the programs,” Van Orden said. “The purpose of that is to encourage responsible bureaucracy.” States face planning difficultiesStates’ error rates in the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, will determine their cost-share for SNAP for up to two years.But states have not received guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on how to navigate the new system, Green said.That has contributed to confusion for states that are looking at funding SNAP benefits for the first time. “We have heard significant concerns from our members across the country about their states being able to fill the (costs) that have been shifted to them,” she said.Several states that budget on a two-year cycle face the additional challenge of trying to project into the future without knowing what their costs would be, North Carolina Democrat Alma Adams said.“States are being asked to budget now for costs that they won't even know until October 2027,” she said. “Combined with other new cost-share responsibilities for Medicaid cuts in the one big, ugly bill, it puts states in an impossible position.”Wyoming success scalable?Schmidt told the panel that a tool known as front-end eligibility allows her agency to reduce errors. The procedure allows investigations into fraud and other improper paperwork before a payment is issued, reducing the cost of chasing down improper payments after the fact.Wyoming, which Schmidt described as small and conservative, has little room for error.“It's not a good use of our small staff to have to go chase down but rather looking at potential fraud at the beginning of the case and then making the decision about whether or not that case should be considered for benefits,” she said.Republicans on the panel asked Schmidt questions about how Wyoming, which had among the lowest error rates in the nation, at 3.27% in fiscal 2024, was able to run its program with so few errors.But Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern, took issue with the example, saying Wyoming’s model was not sustainable for larger states. Wyoming, which has fewer residents than virtually all U.S. House districts, spends more per person on SNAP than any other state, he said.“I'm glad someone from Wyoming is here to talk about how to reduce error rates,” McGovern said. “Wyoming spends $100 a person on administering SNAP. That's the most in the nation. So if the point of this hearing is to imply that other states should have the same error rate as Wyoming, you're going to need to double or triple how much this country spends on food assistance, not slash food assistance like you did in this big, ugly bill.”",,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Monique Limón's district.,"In summary
A bill released in the final days of the legislative session creates a carve-out from more permissive building rules and appears to target just one project: a proposed apartment building in Sen. Monique Limón’s district.


Earlier this year California lawmakers delivered an historic victory for champions of more housing construction by exempting most urban apartment developments from the California Environmental Quality Act, a 50-year-old statute that Yes In My Backyard advocates and the building industry have long blamed as an impediment to building more homes. 
A bill proposed Monday night, just days before the end of the legislative session, would punch a very small hole in that landmark law that appears to apply to just one proposed apartment building in California — in the district represented by the incoming leader of the state Senate.
Senate Bill 158 would subject any project within a city of more than 85,000 but fewer than 95,000 people and within a county of between 440,000 and 455,000 people to the state’s environmental review law.
That only describes one place in California, according to 2020 Census data: Santa Barbara, a city represented by Sen. Monique Limón.
Earlier this year Democrats in the state Senate chose Limón as the body’s next leader. She is set to replace Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, who is termed out in early 2026.  
The legislation further narrows the exemption to any project that abuts a wetland, a creek and a state registered historical landmark. It also carves out projects larger than four acres and those that have made use of a particular state law known as the “builder’s remedy,” which allows developers to bypass local approval processes if a city is out of compliance with state housing planning law.
On social media, Jordan Grimes with the Bay Area nonprofit Greenbelt Alliance and a frequent poster on land use disputes, noted that all those provisions appear to describe a single 270-unit, eight-story building proposed for a site behind Santa Barbara’s historic mission. The project has been the subject of considerable ire among some of the affluent coastal city’s residents and elected leaders. In May, the Santa Barbara mayor called the project a “horrendous nightmare.”
The developers behind the project, going under the corporate name The Mission LLC, have sued the city multiple times, alleging that local officials have illegally delayed the project and denied it a religious-based property tax exemption.
Responding to a question from CalMatters in a written statement, Limón’s office denied that the bill was “designed to prevent a specific project from moving forward.” 
“This bill clarifies narrow instances when environmental review, public input, and mitigation efforts are required on a development that poses a risk to safety,” the statement reads.
In response to a series of follow-up questions, Limón’s office confirmed the senator was responsible for the new legislative language, but refused to explain whether the Mission project is one of the “narrow instances” in which additional review is required and whether there are, in fact, any others. 
Project has local opposition
Opponents of the Mission project, which is located at the mouth of a canyon north of Santa Barbara’s downtown, have raised concerns about wildfires and flooding risk.
The City of Santa Barbara has argued that the CEQA exemption law from earlier this year does not apply to the project. That’s based on the city’s interpretation of the law. The budget bill introduced this week would legally reinforce that position.
In an email, Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse said he would not comment on the project, citing “frequent and continuing litigation with the applicants.” 
Richard Jacobs, a lawyer representing The Mission LCC, refused to comment for this story on behalf of his client.
The last-minute exemption is part of a broader budget trailer bill — legislation that is meant to direct state agencies on how to administer the year’s budget, but which in practice often become vehicles for a variety of policy changes. Unlike other legislation, budget bills are not authored by individual legislators, but by the entire budget committee. 
This year has seen the Legislature take up a bevy of uber-ambitious housing production bills, aimed at making it easier for developers to build in the face of a chronic statewide housing affordability crisis. Throughout the year, a political schism has emerged between the Assembly, helmed by “Yes In My Backyard”-aligned Speaker Robert Rivas, and the Senate, which has been less receptive to that ideology. 
For those hoping to divine how the Senate under Limón’s leadership might welcome pro-development legislation, the 11th-hour carve out is potentially telling.
“Is the incoming leader of the California senate sneakily trying to kill a proposed 250 unit apartment building in Santa Barbara via a budget trailer bill? It certainly seems like it!,” Grimes wrote on X.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081825_Redistricting-Battle-Presser_MG_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

Ken Herndon, who represents the city’s fourth district on the Louisville Metro Council, said Tuesday that statewide laws preempting local control of gun laws are “ridiculous” and that if they were gone he would propose a waiting period for gun purchases in Louisville. 
“All localities in this state have been denied the ability to use legislation to protect our children,” Herndon said. “We owe our children every effort we can muster, with every tool at our disposal, and currently, that tool is not available to us.”  
Should the resolution pass and the General Assembly grant Louisville local control, Herndon said a waiting period when purchasing guns is at the “top of my list.” 
“At the end of the day, the choice is clear to me that it’s our guns or our kids, and I choose our kids,” Herndon said. 
A 2012 Kentucky law bans local governments from regulating the “manufacture, sale, purchase, taxation, transfer, ownership, possession, carrying, storage, or transportation of firearms, ammunition, components of firearms, components of ammunition, firearms accessories or combination thereof.” 
Another law from 2015 dictates that local governments can dispose of firearms only by selling them. This law also was criticized in the aftermath of the 2023 mass shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville, when Mayor Craig Greenberg said the city should be allowed to destroy guns used in crimes and confiscated by police rather than having them sold at public auction. 
Herndon wants the General Assembly to revise both laws, saying the Republican-controlled legislature has already demonstrated its willingness to make laws specific to Jefferson County. In recent years, the legislature’s Republican supermajority —  over the opposition of Democratic lawmakers representing Louisville — has mandated nonpartisan elections for Louisville mayor and council, limited the authority of the local school board and more. 
Herndon made his announcement outside the Western Library near the sites of recent shootings. In one instance, a woman who was walking a child to the school bus stop was fatally shot. In another case nearby, a teenager had fired shots near Central High School and Coleridge-Taylor Montessori Elementary. 
Dustin Isaacs, a spokesman for the Senate President’s office, said Herndon’s resolution is “symbolic” while “the successes of the Kentucky General Assembly in making communities safer are very real.” 
“Lawmakers have a responsibility to protect constitutional rights,” Isaacs said. “The cited statutes protect fundamental rights of law-abiding citizens and create uniformity across all 120 Kentucky counties.” 
“Just as Louisville cannot create an exception to limit a citizen’s right to a trial by jury within its borders, it cannot carve out exceptions to the Second Amendment. It’s worth noting that many of the measures cited in the resolution, such as background checks and mental health restrictions, already exist under federal or state law,” he said. “Regarding the disposition of firearms, the General Assembly has already acted in this area through the Safer Kentucky Act, which allows for the destruction of homicide firearms under state law.” 
Herndon’s resolution cites polling in support of background checks and mental health screens. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia impose some form of waiting period on firearms purchasers.
On Monday, Metro Council Republicans presented a “Safer Louisville” plan with a slew of policy suggestions that “either address aspects of crime that oftentimes escalate into greater more dangerous criminal activity, seek to improve safe behavior or support efforts to bring more officers to our neighborhoods,” the plan says. 
Policies in this proposal include:

Submit amendments to the Louisville Metro Code of Ordinances to make it an offense (citation) for someone to pass money, food, or other items from their vehicle while on Louisville Metro Arterial Roads. 
Work with the Goodwill’s Another Way Program and other groups to create an education campaign that will include signage to help educate persons that streetside and sidewalk almsgiving or panhandling are not effective and oftentimes counterproductive towards helping persons. 
Invest funding from their Neighborhood Development Funds to create two pilot programs where streetlights are added to areas designated by police as being locations of higher levels of crime. 
Seek additional funding through partnerships with state and other agencies to construct a new, state-of-the-art training facility for regional first responders. 
Sponsor a resolution from members of the Metro Council strongly advocating that the governor and Justice Cabinet do everything it can to expedite the opening of a Juvenile Justice Facility within Jefferson County. 
And more. 

“When each member of our caucus campaigned for office, they cited improving public safety as their top priority,” Republican Caucus Chair Anthony Piagentini of District 19 said in a statement. “Although we have already successfully executed some changes, there is a lot more work to do. We believe that Louisville can be one of the safest cities in the country. To accomplish that, we have developed this plan that we wanted to share with the public to further this goal. We cannot have a successful city until we have a safe city.”
Christopher 2X advocates against violence in Louisville
Christopher 2X, who advocates against violence in Louisville and runs Game Changers, which mentors youth in Jefferson County, said he can’t challenge anyone’s ideas for making the city safer. 
But, he said, change has to happen beyond the guns themselves, because people can find ways to access and misuse guns regardless of laws. 
Effectively addressing gun violence, he said, means going upstream and addressing why people want to engage in “reckless gun play” in the first place. 
In addition to the gun reforms, Herndon wants to ensure there are crosswalks at all bus stops, start a chess league for youth in his district and more. 
“I welcome all serious, good efforts,” 2X told the Lantern. “Will young people still be willing and ready to find weapons, even with new laws? Absolutely they will. And that’s not a knock on anybody. We’ve got to go after these mindsets even harder.”

(Courtesy photo)A remediation agreement signed in July shows Jennifer-Ruth Green was already the subject of an inspector general investigation into alleged misuse of state resources and workplace misconduct before her sudden resignation as Indiana’s public safety secretary last week.
The document, obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, shows Gov. Mike Braun’s office agreed to allow her to remain in her position “pending the results of the Office of Inspector General investigation with appropriate safeguards in place to prevent additional ethics violations, including additional ethics training.”
The governor’s office conducted an expedited internal review of the allegations in mid-June after learning about the OIG investigation, which began in February.
The six-page document was signed later, on July 21, by Green; Josh Kelley, Gov. Mike Braun’s chief of staff; and Patrick Price, the governor’s general counsel. It warned that if allegations denied by Green are later substantiated, “appropriate steps will be determined at that time, up to and including termination.”
Indiana Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green resigns

Among the allegations against Green are claims that she used state vehicles and travel cards for personal and political purposes, and that she directed state employees to assist with those activities during work hours.
Additional accusations center around inappropriate workplace conduct, ranging from “conversations with employees about personal relationships, intimate subjects, or sexual activities,” to “uninvited touching of employees” and retaliation.
Green has denied most of the allegations, state officials said in the agreement, although she admitted to “limited” personal use of state vehicles and “having a financial relationship with an employee” without disclosing the conflict of interest.
Messages seeking comment from Green were not returned Tuesday. She is currently out of the state for guard training.
When asked about the allegations and remediation agreement, Griffin Reid — a spokesperson for Braun’s office — said only that, “we don’t comment on specific personnel matters.”
The public safety secretary is an appointee of the governor.
The Indiana State Personnel Department confirmed to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that Green resigned Sept. 5. A spokesperson for SPD said Green has no discipline in her record “which resulted in suspension, demotion or discharge.”
While Green’s case is not listed on the Indiana State Ethics Commission’s public agenda, commissioners are scheduled for an executive session on Thursday to discuss “an individual’s alleged misconduct.”
Allegations outlined
The remediation agreement revealed that “ethics concerns were raised” in late February about an “event (Green) hosted on state property,” and that “those concerns were referred to the Office of Inspector General for investigation.”
The event in question was a Feb. 28 meet-and-greet at the state government center in Indianapolis, which invited attendees to “Come by and meet Secretary Green along with her family!” The flyer said to send questions to an outside political consultant.

By mid-June, the OIG investigation was “potentially expanding into additional areas of potential ethics violations,” officials wrote in the remediation agreement. 
The Indiana Inspector General is responsible for investigating and addressing fraud, waste, abuse, and wrongdoing in any agency within the executive branch of state government.
The agreement alleged she used state vehicles and travel cards for personal events. She also allegedly directed state employees to generate and post content on her personal social media pages and asked them to staff personal or political events.
The agreement further suggests that Green promoted her book and brand, “Battle-Proven Leadership,” during state time or with state employees and resources. She was also accused of asking staff to perform personal errands, including driving family members and completing tasks at her residence.
Other accusations detailed in the agreement include holding political meetings in her state office, facilitating fundraisers and attending political events using state resources.
Green’s workplace behavior was also flagged in the remediation document, specifically around allegations that her conduct “made female employees uncomfortable.” 
“This conduct includes: making comments about female employees’ clothing/body in front of other employees; your uninvited touching of female employees; your discussing personal relationships/intimate subjects during work hours with female employees,” according to the agreement.
Retaliation claims were documented, too: “Staff who have tried to advise you of concerns have felt retaliated against/punished/put in the doghouse as a result.”
The agreement states that in a June 30 meeting, Green acknowledged limited wrongdoing. 
She “admitted to some violations, including that the state vehicle has been used on limited occasions for personal use, state employees had generated content for your personal social media pages, and to having a financial relationship (rent) with an employee whom you hired.”
She denied the other allegations.
Pending ethics investigation
State officials, in the remediation agreement, imposed a series of requirements for Green’s continued employment within Indiana’s government.
Green was instructed to reimburse the state for mileage and gas costs associated with personal and political use of her state vehicle. 
She was specifically barred from using a state vehicle for any other political purposes, such as traveling to and from campaign events, and could not ask subordinates to staff political appearances.
Green was also tasked with “a mandatory ethics training refresher” hosted jointly by OIG, and ethics counsel from the governor’s office.

The agreement additionally emphasized promotion of an “appropriate workplace” and prohibited Green from any “uninvited touching,” making comments about an employee’s appearance, or discussing “personal relationships, intimate subjects or sexual activities” with staff.
In addition, Green was forbidden from retaliating against any employee who participated in ongoing investigations.
“You need to have and foster as normal a work environment as possible,” the signed agreement stated.
A possible congressional run
Braun said on Saturday Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott will take on an expanded role as the new secretary of public safety.
Green’s resignation came less than a year after she joined Braun’s cabinet and could open the door for a second congressional bid.
She has been a rising figure in state Republican politics since her 2022 run for U.S. Congress in Indiana’s 1st District, where she mounted a competitive challenge to Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. 
Despite losing that race, Green came within 5 percentage points in a traditionally Democratic stronghold.
Tim Edson, who served as Green’s consultant on her 2022 congressional race, told the Capital Chronicle on Monday that Green “is seriously weighing another run for Congress in northwest Indiana and Republican leaders in Indiana and nationally are encouraging her to enter the race.”
Republicans are currently considering mid-cycle redistricting, aiming to grow the number of GOP-held seats in Congress. The 1st District, along with Marion County’s 7th District, are both held by Democrats.
Green, a combat veteran and cybersecurity expert, had been appointed to the post in December as part of Braun’s incoming administration. At the time, Braun said her “military and cybersecurity background made her uniquely qualified to lead Indiana’s public safety agencies.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-09-09 21:23:29+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ watchdog’s probe of public insurance funds alleges ‘covert takeover’ by private interests,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/09/nj-watchdogs-probe-of-public-insurance-funds-alleges-covert-takeover-by-private-interests/,The comptroller said his review suggests a single private firm effectively gained control of New Jersey’s public insurance pools.,"Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh blocked procurement proposals by two joint insurance funds after finding longstanding undisclosed conflicts of interest and other contracting law violations. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The state comptroller said Tuesday that he found a bevy of violations at three public joint insurance funds that include the steering of contracts to favored and politically connected vendors, contracting law infractions and conflicts of interest that went undisclosed for years.
In a new report, acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh said an investigation launched by his office suggests a single private firm — insurance company Conner Strong & Buckelew — had effectively gained control of New Jersey’s public insurance pools.
Conner Strong, one of the nation’s largest insurance firms, was founded by South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, who left the firm last year after he was indicted on unrelated racketeering charges later thrown out by a Superior Court judge.
Walsh claims that Conner Strong and a related entity operating under the name PERMA for years failed to tell regulators or the joint insurance funds that they are legally and practically a single business. Walsh’s report says Conner Strong and PERMA’s employees overlap, the two companies share leadership, and in many cases, they write rules for how a contract will be awarded — then compete for and win that same contract.
“This consolidation of control by a vendor happened without adequate disclosure, competition or accountability,” the report says. “The result is an unauthorized covert takeover of a core public function by a private entity — and a serious risk to public trust and public dollars.”
Walsh blocked procurements proposed by two of the joint insurance funds as a result of his findings.
Dan Fee, a spokesperson for Norcross, said Norcross has not returned to Conner Strong since his departure last year. Fee challenged the veracity of the comptroller’s report, likening it to Attorney General Matt Platkin’s now-dismissed indictment of Norcross (Platkin is appealing the dismissal).
“Like Matt Platkin’s case against Norcross and his allies in rebuilding Camden — a case which was quickly dismissed by the courts — today’s Comptroller report is rife with factual inaccuracies and evinces a fundamental lack of understanding of the issues,” he said.
Fee’s statement did not identify the inaccuracies.
Past reviews by regulators at the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Department of Community Affairs and a previous comptroller had found the health insurance funds to be in compliance with state law and regulation, Fee said.
Walsh’s report says the lack of notice to regulators about the nature of PERMA and Conner Strong’s relationship “explains why no concerns were raised by regulators.”
A spokesman for George Norcross said Tuesday’s report from New Jersey’s comptroller is “rife with factual inaccuracies.” (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Clear conflict?
Joint insurance funds are a statutory purchasing mechanism for local government units like municipalities, counties and school boards. Individual government units pool their workers to dilute risk and to secure health and other insurance products at lower prices than they could individually.
Some joint insurance funds have seen enrollment spike as municipalities flee the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program, which faces a death spiral due to years of soaring premiums driving governments off the system and sending premiums yet higher, spurring more departures.
Walsh’s review found PERMA’s executive director operated as the administrator for three joint insurance funds — the Southern New Jersey Regional Employee Benefits Fund, the Schools Health Insurance Fund, and the Municipal Reinsurance Health Insurance Fund — for which Conner Strong was a program manager.
State regulations bar joint insurance fund administrators, who manage day-to-day operations, from simultaneously serving as program managers, who provide actuarial and other professional services.
Procurements issued by the Southern New Jersey Regional Employee Benefits Fund in May and June of 2024 were designed to exclude other vendors, the comptroller said. The fund provides benefits to more than 9,500 enrollees across 40 local government units in South Jersey.
Those requests for proposals, which sought carriers to act as third-party administrators, were initially submitted under standards that are disallowed for cooperative purchasing, which requires solicitations award the lowest responsible bidder, the report says.
The solicitations were drawn to benefit existing vendors by requiring that bids include equivalents for roughly 100 health plan designs, the comptroller said. They allowed bidders to submit equivalent offerings but did not provide technical or other data that bidders would need to demonstrate equivalency, he said. 
“Essentially, the specification was so narrowly tailored that it was designed specifically for the incumbent vendor,” the comptroller’s report says.
The procurements’ structure would have afforded PERMA and Conner Strong sole control over procurement for six joint insurance funds covering nearly 300 government entities and covering just under 110,000 individuals, the report says.
Walsh’s office found similar issues in a June 2024 solicitation issued by the Schools Health Insurance Fund when it was seeking a program manager. The report says PERMA’s executive director oversaw prior procurements for the fund that awarded Conner Strong a program manager contract despite the executive director being a Conner Strong employee.
The executive director’s financial disclosure listed Conner Strong as an employer and source of income, but did not mention PERMA. The executive director, whom the report does not name, told the comptroller’s office that Conner Strong management, a likely bidder, reviewed the school insurance fund’s solicitation before it was submitted to the comptroller’s office for review (state law requires the comptroller to review procurement proposals where the worth of a contract is expected to exceed certain dollar amounts, which vary year-to-year).
“This process, which is legally required to be fair, objective, and focused on protecting taxpayer funds, was instead managed by CSB, the incumbent vendor, which reviewed its own proposals and interpreted the procurement rules, ultimately compromising the integrity of the process through bias,” the comptroller’s report says. “Conflicts of interest do not get any clearer than this.”
Joseph DiBella, who oversees Conner Strong’s marketing department, did not return requests for comment sent to his email addresses at Conner Strong and PERMA.
The Schools Health Insurance Fund denied a conflict of interest in correspondence to the comptroller. The comptroller’s office took that as a suggestion that the fund intended to award the new contract to Conner Strong and denied the procurement proposal.
Walsh’s office also raised concerns about the legality of the Municipal Reinsurance Health Insurance Fund, noting its members — other joint insurance funds — are not local or contracting units permitted to create joint insurance funds under state law.
Regulators should review the municipal reinsurance fund’s role in Hi Fund, a marketing brand for PERMA and Conner Strong that falsely claimed it acted as a health insurance pool and used officials’ likenesses in advertising online and at the New Jersey League of Municipalities annual conference, apparently without their knowledge, Walsh said.
Walsh’s report calls Hi Fund “a front used to generate business” for Conner Strong. After an interview with the comptroller’s office, Hi Fund added a disclaimer to its web pages noting it is only a branding name and not a company, the report says.
Hi Fund’s logo appeared on procurement documents submitted by the Southern New Jersey fund, and neither PERMA’s executive director nor the municipal reinsurance fund’s qualified purchasing agent could explain why, the comptroller’s report says
“Notably, there are no indications that the financial interests and potential conflicts of interest resulting from PERMA/CSB’s and CSB’s creation of the Hi Fund have been disclosed to DOBI or HIF trustees,” Walsh said.
The comptroller’s office directed the insurance funds to submit corrective plans detailing how they will eliminate conflicts of interest, enforce the prohibition barring program managers and administrators from the same firm, and detail how they will secure insurance-related services in compliance with procurement laws. It suggested legislators boost oversight of joint insurance funds.
The office referred its findings to the Departments of Banking and Insurance and Community Affairs, the School Ethics Commission, and the Division of Consumer Affairs.
Fee’s response to Tuesday’s report notes that Walsh will likely be out as the state’s comptroller when a new governor takes office in January.
“This new report should be seen for what it is: an investigation conducted by a politically motivated Acting-Comptroller for his own self-promotion on his way out the door,” Fee said.

The goal of the effort, led by Kansas-City-based hemp business American Shaman, is to repeal the 41-page constitutional amendment that legalized recreational marijuana in 2022. 
Each version of the proposed initiative petition would replace the marijuana legalization amendment with language that instructs Missouri lawmakers to create regulations that are “no more burdensome than what we already have for alcohol and tobacco,” said Eapen Thampy, a longtime hemp lobbyist.
“Marijuana and hemp are one plant,” Thampy said in an interview Tuesday. “They should be regulated in the same way. It should be a free, fair and regulated market.”
The effort is being organized under a new political action committee called Missourians for a Single Market.
The four petitions differ slightly, but they each would take out criminal offenses for possessing too much marijuana. They’d also retain the current taxes on the products for at least the next 10 years, and allow businesses to obtain licenses to sell the products through a similar process as they do with alcohol and tobacco products. 
Currently marijuana facility licenses are limited and highly regulated, but businesses don’t need a license to sell intoxicating hemp products — despite numerous legislative attempts to outright ban them. 
“Legislative efforts to ban hemp products allow the illegal market to flourish,” said Gary Wiegert, a retired St. Louis City police sergeant, in the group’s Tuesday press release announcing the initiative petition campaign. “Regulating these products and preserving legal access to the market ensures public safety by allowing business owners to serve the consumer market instead.”
Hemp lobbyist Eapen Thampy and Deb Nash of Canna Answers filed four initiative petitions on hemp and marijuana regulations on Tuesday with the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office in Jefferson City (photo submitted).
In many ways, it’s the latest showdown between the marijuana industry, which has operated legally in Missouri since 2018 but is still outlawed federally,  and the hemp industry, whose products were legalized by the 2018 Farm Bill.
At the end of the day, what’s the difference between intoxicating hemp products and intoxicating marijuana products?
Hemp and marijuana are essentially terms the government uses to distinguish between the part of the cannabis plant that has high amounts of THC, or their psychoactive component.
Any part of the plant containing 0.3% or less THC by dry weight is defined as hemp. And that’s why in 2018 Congress removed hemp and hemp seeds from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s schedule of controlled substances as part of the Farm Bill.
Cannabis buds – or what the industry calls “flower” – must be smoked or heated to release Delta-9 THC that produces a high. 
So eating most raw cannabis flower shouldn’t get someone high.
There is a growing legal argument that marijuana sold in dispensaries that doesn’t contain .3% Delta-9 THC before it’s smoked or heated is actually hemp.
Currently, a number of Missouri cannabis events – where people are selling weed outside of dispensaries – are operating under this interpretation of the federal definition.
The initiative petitions filed Tuesday support this interpretation. 
The effort also aims to regulate products, such as edibles, beverages and vapes, that are currently being sold in gas stations and stores without any testing or tracking requirements. The lack of state regulation has led some municipal governments to try and find a way to regulate them through city health departments. 
“Our position is that marijuana legalization has always been not about getting ‘high’ but to end prohibition against one of the most beneficial plants on earth,” said Tim Gilio, founder of the Missouri Marijuana Legalization Movement. “Our goal is to open up a free and open market to all and prevent a monopoly from encroaching on any benefits of the cannabis plant.”
However, Andrew Mullins, executive director for the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, told The Independent in June that the idea is a “bait and switch.” 
The state’s regulated marijuana industry, he said, generated $241 million in state and local tax revenues last year alone and is regarded as one of the most successful marijuana programs in the country, citing a Wall Street Journal article. At a marijuana industry conference last week, company leaders agreed that limited licenses for dispensaries and grow facilities was key to Missouri’s success. 
Voters have twice voted for cannabis regulation, Mullins said in June, and any effort to roll back those constitutional protections would be a “spectacular failure.”
“Missourians aren’t about to take hundreds of millions away from local communities, veterans and our justice system, all in hopes that politicians will eventually replace it with something down the road,” Mullins said.  
Thampy said that tax revenue wouldn’t go away. The taxable market would increase by about a third, he said, “meaning tens of millions in new revenue for public defenders, substance abuse prevention, and the Missouri Veterans Commission.”
The petitions were filed with the Missouri Secretary of State on Tuesday afternoon. The group aims to get enough signatures by May to appear on the November 2026 ballot.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5345-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)From a seven-digit campaign account to high-profile public appearances and a growing payroll, all signs pointed to Helena Buonanno Foulkes’ return to Rhode Island politics.
But the former CVS executive and 2022 Democratic gubernatorial candidate couldn’t resist one last teaser.
“2026 is going to be a very big year,” she told the standing-room only crowd at Roger Williams Park Casino Tuesday. “I am excited to share today, wait for it, that I am going to be a grandmother.”
Seconds later, Foulkes confirmed the actual reason for the splashy event billed by her campaign as a “major announcement” — her candidacy in the 2026 gubernatorial race. The announcement cements a rematch between Foulkes and Gov. Dan McKee, who faced off in a four-way Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2022. Foulkes lost to McKee in 2022 by three percentage points.
The 61-year-old Providence resident has already built a bigger war chest for her comeback, with $2.1 million cash on hand as of June 30 compared with McKee’s $879,000, according to reports filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. Foulkes recently hired veteran campaign consultant Eric Hyers, who managed successful congressional campaigns for former U.S. Rep David Cicilline and former Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo. McKee’s campaign manager left three weeks ago, months after he was hired.
Hours before Foulkes made her 2026 candidacy official Tuesday, McKee’s campaign released a digital attack ad on YouTube doubling down on Foulkes’ role in the opioid crisis. The 60-second ad and corresponding website, sheknew.com, cites the late 2024 U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit, claiming CVS executives perpetuated the opioid epidemic, with a top-down leadership style that prevented employees from speaking up against wrongdoings. Foulkes left her post as president of CVS Pharmacy Inc. in 2018, ending a 25-year career with the Woonsocket company that included four years leading its pharmaceutical arm. Her executive role partially overlapped with the time frame of the DOJ complaint.
The 97-page federal lawsuit against CVS never identifies Foulkes by name.
Foulkes in a sit-down interview following her announcement on Tuesday defended her record at CVS, as well as the company overall, pointing to its efforts starting in 2017 to reduce opioid misuse and addiction by limiting supply, expanding access to overdose reversal drugs and increasing efforts to prevent prescription fraud and abuse.
CVS in a statement Tuesday called McKee’s attack ad “unfortunate and discouraging.”
“It’s also inappropriate to disparage and intentionally misrepresent the contributions of our 7,000 colleagues who live and work in a state we’ve called home for more than 50 years,” the company stated.

The blame game 
Turning the heat back on McKee Tuesday, Foulkes pointed to the most recent major employer to jump ship under his watch. On Monday, Pawtucket toy and gaming empire Hasbro Inc. announced it would abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots in favor of a new headquarters in the Boston Seaport by the end of 2026. 
The loss of Hasbro was far from Foulkes’ only critique of McKee. From failure to provide the funds necessary to prevent cuts to Rhode Island Public Transit Authority to the ongoing delays and rising costs over the Washington Bridge rebuild, she made her dissatisfaction with the four-year incumbent clear. 
“Five years, people,” Foulkes said, referring to the time lapse between when the westbound highway shuttered, and the expected November 2028 completion date. “I gave birth to four children in four-and-a-half years.”










Five years, people. I gave birth to four children in four-and-a-half years. 


– Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Helena Buonanno Foulkes on the time lapse between the December 2023 closure of the Washington Bridge and the expected November 2028 completion date.


Blasting the state’s leadership broadly for “incompetence” and bureaucracy,” she took aim at its bloated spending, including the $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget.
“Last session, our leaders did what Rhode Island has done for years,” Foulkes said. “Tape together a budget, add some new fees and raise taxes, throw in an accounting gimmick or two, make some insiders and lobbyists happy. Fail to be accountable. Fail to plan.”
Later, in an interview Foulkes acknowledged that the governor does not have sole authority over the state budget, which is largely shaped by the Rhode Island General Assembly, and specifically, the House Speaker. 
“But I think the governor could have asserted a lot more control,” she said of McKee’s role in crafting the final fiscal 2026 spending plan. As for McKee’s decision not to sign the final product, but not to veto it either, Foulkes concluded, “That seems like a very weak way to go about building a budget.”
In contrast, she described herself as a candidate with “guts,” willing to take a stand, whether it be on full funding for public transportation, the Republican-backed push for a state inspector general, or President Donald Trump’s administration. Her critique of Trump was even more scathing than her words for McKee. Foulkes called the president “reckless, irresponsible and belligerent.”

Taking a stand
While McKee has come out swinging against the Trump administration in recent weeks after federal regulators ordered work to stop on the almost completed Revolution Wind order, he has been more muted on consequences of federal budget cuts, grant suspensions and immigration and education policies.
“When I look at all the Democratic governors, I don’t think that Gov. McKee has been at all on the front line,” Foulkes said later. “My biggest criticism is that he’s not planning ahead for Rhode Islanders.”
She concluded her 20-minute speech by declaring, “our current governor does not deserve a third term,” punctuated by singer Lizzo’s pop anthem, “It’s about damn time.”
The crowd was a who’s who of state officials, business executives and community leaders, including Democratic Sens. Sam Zurier, of Providence, and Lou DiPalma, of Middletown, and Democratic Reps. Mark McKenney, of Warwick, and Robert Phillips, of Woonsocket. Rhode Island Democratic Party Chair Liz Beretta-Perik, Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. and Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence Executive Director Melissa Carden also attended.
Foulkes started her day with breakfast in Central Falls with Mayor Maria Rivera and Dr. Pablo Rodriguez, a public health and political commentator with his own radio show. Her afternoon agenda included talking to East Providence business owners, followed by a community gathering at an East Providence resident’s home, according to her campaign. Foulkes plans to hold community meetings in all 39 cities and towns this fall.
Two other potential contenders for the 2026 governor’s race, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, and 2022 Republican candidate Ashley Kalus, each weighed in with individual statements Tuesday.
Shekarchi, who remains the top fundraiser in the state with more than $3.8 million cash on hand, welcomed Foulkes’ candidacy.
“I applaud anyone willing to pursue public service, which from my experience is challenging, yet rewarding,” Shekarchi said. “The voters will decide next year which candidate for governor has the strongest record of delivering for working families and the best ideas to lead Rhode Island.”
Kalus denounced Foulkes for a track record of “failed corporate leadership” and the timing of her announcement on the heels of Hasbro’s departure as “political opportunism.”
“Her campaign isn’t a bid for leadership; it’s a liquidation sale for the state of Rhode Island,” Kalus said. “Voters deserve better than another well-connected insider cashing out at our expense.”

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa) The University of Northern Iowa Army ROTC program learned this week it will continue operations in a new capacity after it was identified for inactivation this summer.
According to a news release from the university, UNI leadership and Iowa National Guard partners spent the summer exploring ways to keep cadets learning on campus after hearing the news in late June.
The university’s Reserve Officer Training Corps program will continue to operate on campus as an “extension unit” of the program offered by the University of Iowa, according to the release. Those enrolled in the UNI program will remain on campus for all four years of their training.

“The Army’s decision affirms the strength of UNI’s ROTC program and ensures that students can continue to pursue their education and military training right here in Cedar Falls,” said UNI President Mark Nook in the release. “Many individuals, from our faculty and staff to the Iowa National Guard and Army, made it possible to find a path forward for our cadets.”
UNI spokesperson Adam Amdor said in an email the university will continue to provide the necessary facilities, office support and academic oversight for program participants, but the program’s commanding officer will be housed at the UI. He said details on how many instructors and staff will work from UNI are still being discussed.
UNI was one of 10 “host units” selected for inactivation by U.S. Army Cadet Command, joined by institutions in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Missouri, North Carolina, California and New York. Other ROTC units across the U.S. are also seeing changes to their status and level of operation.
Any student can take ROTC courses for the first two years of the program without any commitment to the Army or military experience, according to the program website, and those who do complete the four-year program will graduate with a commission as a 2nd lieutenant in the Army and serve in “one of 18 different career fields.”
Coming into its 40th year of operation at UNI, the ROTC program had 50 total enrollees as of Sept. 9, Amdor said in an email.
“We are proud of our longstanding partnership with the Army and of the generations of leaders who have come through this program,” said Brenda Bass, dean of the UNI College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, in the release. “UNI’s ROTC program is academically strong and has some of the best facilities in the region. We are grateful to Army ROTC Cadet Command and the Iowa National Guard for their innovative collaboration that will allow UNI’s proud ROTC legacy to continue.”

Several people were exposed to and infected with measles after attending a Utah High School Cycling League event at Soldier Hollow on Aug. 16, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release issued Monday. 
About 2,000 people attended that event. Health officials said they’re monitoring for any additional cases from that event and other league gatherings. 
“Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily, even at outdoor events,” state epidemiologist Leisha Nolen said in a prepared statement. “Given the number of people who may have been exposed to measles at Soldier Hollow on August 16, 2025, we encourage attendees and participants of upcoming Utah High School Cycling League Region 6 events to check their (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination status.”

State health officials said they’re working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families of race participants who attended the event at Soldier Hollow about the measles exposure. 
“We are also working collaboratively to help prevent spread at ongoing practices and upcoming events,” state health officials said. 
Utah’s measles outbreak continues to grow, with 24 confirmed cases as of Monday, according to the state’s 2025 measles dashboard. Fourteen of those cases have been confirmed in southwest Utah. 
The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine helps protect people from measles, and it’s one of the most safe and effective tools to control the spread of the viral infection. Two doses are recommended for children ages 4 and older. 
Of Utah’s 24 confirmed cases so far, 21 were not vaccinated, according to the state’s dashboard. Eleven are younger than 18 years old, while 11 are older. 
Measles symptoms usually begin to surface one to two weeks after exposure, health officials said. Symptoms include a mild to moderate fever with a cough, runny nose, and red watery eyes. Days later, the fever typically spikes, and is followed by a blotchy, red rash that can appear red or darker than usual skin tone around the face, hairline and ears. The rash then rapidly spreads downward to the rest of the body.
“If you develop symptoms, you should stay away from other people and call your healthcare provider,” state officials said. “Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure.”

,DC,2025-09-09 21:00:17+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Supreme Court rules Trump administration can refuse to spend $4B in foreign aid for now,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-rules-trump-administration-can-refuse-spend-4b-foreign-aid-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Trump administration can temporarily hold on to $4 billion in foreign aid funding approved by Congress, overturning a lower court’s order and continuing a struggle over who controls the nation’s purse strings. The one-page ruling from the emergency docket, signed by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., came just one day after the administration appealed the lower court’s ruling. While the original lawsuit over withheld foreign aid began in February and stemmed from an executive order, the Trump administration sent Congress a rescissions request covering some of the spending in late August. The proposal is part of the formal process laid out in a 1974 law that allows the president to ask lawmakers to cancel previously approved spending. Congress typically has 45 days to approve, modify, or disagree with a rescissions request. During that time the president can legally freeze the funding and only has to spend it if lawmakers don’t approve the plan.  This particular rescission request, however, was sent to lawmakers within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year, creating a dispute that complicated the nature of the original lawsuit. That maneuver, sometimes called a pocket rescission, is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and several members of Congress, though White House budget director Russ Vought believes it's within the bounds of the law. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Trump administration’s appeal that the federal district court’s order to spend the funding “requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself.”“Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients,” he added. The Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday doesn’t address whether the justices agree with the administration that it can refuse to spend the billions in foreign aid since it sent the rescissions request close to the end of the fiscal year. Roberts wrote “that the September 3, 2025 order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, case Nos. 1:25-cv-400 and 1:25-cv-402, is hereby partially stayed for funds that are subject to the President’s August 28, 2025 recission proposal currently pending before Congress pending further order of the undersigned or of the Court. It is further ordered that a response to the application be filed on or before Friday, September 12th, 2025, by 4 p.m. (EDT).”",,,,2025-09-09 17:57:53.697644

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida schools rose their free-speech rank while scoring lower than the year before in a survey by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. 
Florida’s average score in the College Free Speech Rankings was 63.1 out of 100, dropping 1.1 from the year before. However, Florida’s average rank out of 257 was 74, rising 25 spots since the year before. 
Not all institutions in Florida were rated; FIRE queried students at six public institutions and one private, the University of Miami. Florida State University scored highest in the state at 17th nationally of 257 schools. UM was the least favorable at 229th. 


FIRE Free Speech rankings

FSU: 17th C-
USF: 24th C-
UF: 45th D
FIU: 53rd D
FAU: 68th D-
UCF: 80th D-
UM: 229th F



Following a academic-like grading scale, FIRE’s scoring gave only 11 schools a C or better and 166 of the 257 schools surveyed got an F. 
Florida’s average grade was a D, while the national average was F. 
Schools were graded on students’ comfort expressing ideas, disruptive conduct, openness, self-censorship, administrative support, and political tolerance.
Students were surveyed during the spring semester. Since then, an FSU employee wearing an Israel Defense Forces was charged with battery after allegedly hitting a student criticizing Israel and saying “free Palestine.” That encounter created headlines and prompted FSU to issue a formal response.

Reacting
The survey found that 34% of Florida students said using violence to stop people from speaking on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases. That number is the same as the national average.
Twice as many, 68%, said shouting down a speaker to silence them while on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases. That number is 3% lower than the national average.
National data from the FIRE survey. (Screenshot via FIRE’s Free Speech Rankings report)
FIRE is involved in a lawsuit against Florida, litigating against the Stop WOKE Act. That law restricts classroom instruction related to “race, color, national origin, or sex.” 
In that lawsuit, an attorney for the state asserted authority to control professors’ content, “because in the classroom, the professor’s speech is the government’s speech, and the government can restrict professors on a content-wide basis … .” 
That case remains pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
That does not heavily dampen Florida schools’ scores, since scoring is based on students’ expression, not on faculty’s, FIRE said. 
Nationwide, FIRE said, “conservative students are increasingly joining their liberal peers in supporting censorship.”
The rankings “show a continued decline in support for free speech among all students, but particularly conservatives. Students of every political persuasion show a deep unwillingness to encounter controversial ideas,” FIRE said in a news release announcing the results. 
Students in the state were surveyed on how often they hide political beliefs in attempts to get a better grade: 34% said never, 30% said rarely, 21% said once or twice a month, 9% said a couple of times a week, and 6% said nearly every day.
42% of students in Florida said they feel their school has made it somewhat clear that free speech is protected on campus and 38% say it is very or extremely clear.
FSU was identified as a “consistently ‘good’ school for free speech.”
Harvard University, 245th, and Columbia University, 256th, rank near the bottom, while Claremont McKenna College, Purdue University, and the University of Chicago claimed the top three spots. 
“This year, students largely opposed allowing any controversial campus speaker, no matter that speaker’s politics,” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said in a news release. 
“Rather than hearing out and then responding to an ideological opponent, both liberal and conservative college students are retreating from the encounter entirely. This will only harm students’ ability to think critically and create rifts between them. We must champion free speech on campus as a remedy to our culture’s deep polarization.”
The survey found that for every “conservative student,” there are 1.57 “liberal students.”
Last year, a state survey comparing Florida students to nationwide numbers found that the Sunshine State was home to more Republican students than the national average.

The new law, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, contains many of the president’s policy and budget priorities: cutting taxes, particularly for the wealthiest Americans; boosting funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and slashing funding for health care and food assistance programs, among others. 
“We think it’s important for us to understand from a budget perspective, what the Congress has done, but more importantly, we need to prepare, and help Minnesotans prepare, for what could be a hard economic hit and a lack of stability,” Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy said Tuesday. 
The subcommittee will meet weekly beginning Sept. 18, and plans to alternate meetings in St. Paul with visits to affected communities around the state. 
The new mandates for major programs are taking effect while the supervising federal agencies are short-staffed, causing a lack of clarity and oversight for the local people charged with enforcing the new rules, said Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Burnsville, who will chair the committee. 
“We need to understand what those unanswered questions are, so that we can help to try to provide some stability moving forward, and work in partnership with the cities, the counties, the school boards, with our farmers and teachers and nurses,” Port said.

The donation is a longstanding tradition, part of National Rice Month. Sanders said the event represents supporting “all Arkansans.” She lauded farmers for making the donations despite tough market conditions that have squeezed commodity farmers.
Arkansans are paying millions more for daily necessities as a result of tariffs placed on imports by the Trump administration, according to a report from Farmers for Free Trade. Farmers could be particularly impacted by these policies because they have input costs for items like tractor parts and fertilizer that could increase even more because of tariffs.
Brian Burton, the CEO of Arkansas Food Bank, said some of the farmers who made donations last year were no longer in business due to the pressures the market has placed on the industry.
“This time that we’re living in, it’s so tumultuous and fraught with uncertainty,” Burton said. “I think about those of you who, even though you’re going through hard times, you don’t forget those who are hungry and are really struggling on the edge of our economy.”

In a video released by the office, Secretary of State Michael Howe said the sticker has come to symbolize participation in democracy.
“When someone wears that sticker to work, to the grocery store, or to pick up their kids, they are inspiring others,” Howe said. “It’s a 2-inch declaration that says, ‘I matter. My voice counts and I’m part of something bigger than myself.’”
Submissions can be made online or by mail beginning Sept. 15. Children must have the consent of their parent or guardian. More details can be found on the contest website.

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — A man slept on the cool, gray steps of Independence Boulevard Christian Church, the building and its columns shielding his body from the midday sun on a recent weekday. A few others lingered in the shade under nearby trees.
On Monday evenings, the more-than-century-old church in Historic Northeast Kansas City opens its doors to people in need. It offers a free meal, hygiene products, clothing and a medical clinic. Hundreds often come.
President Donald Trump’s nationwide gerrymandering push has now also arrived at the church’s literal doorstep.
Northeast Kansas City currently sits comfortably inside Missouri’s 5th Congressional District, which encompasses much of the city and the surrounding metro area. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, an 80-year-old Democrat who was the city’s first Black mayor in the 1990s, has held the seat for 20 years.
But Missouri Republicans are advancing a redrawn congressional map through the state legislature that aims to give the party a political advantage. It would crack the city’s urban core into three districts — with all of them converging on the corner of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, home to Independence Boulevard Christian Church.
The intersection’s southwest corner, where the church is located, would move into the 4th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Mark Alford, a second-term Republican who was previously a TV news anchor. The southeast corner, a parking lot, would stay in a 5th District reshaped to embrace a much more rural and conservative constituency.
The northern side, lined by red-brick apartments and a meat market, would join the 6th District. Held by Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves since 2001, it would stretch across the state to the Illinois border.
Residents say they fear that dividing the area, with its complex interplay of problems and positive qualities, will dilute their voice in Washington, D.C.

“We need somebody to understand what poverty looks like,” the Rev. Mindy Fugarino, the church’s senior pastor, told Stateline as she described her problems with the gerrymander and how it will weaken the neighborhood’s representation.
“We need somebody to understand, what are the needs for housing,” Fugarino said. “We need somebody to understand what are the needs for fair wages and health care and those kind of things in a community where people are literally living and sometimes dying on the street.”
The Missouri House passed the new map in a 90-65 vote Tuesday, sending it to the state Senate. The Senate could begin work on the map as early as Wednesday.
The Missouri gerrymander marks the latest example of a Republican-controlled state heeding Trump’s call to redraw congressional districts. Creating more GOP-leaning districts would maximize the party’s chances of retaining control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections.
Democrats, both in Missouri and across the country, have condemned the effort as election-rigging. California has retaliated by asking its voters to approve a Democratic gerrymander. Republicans say they want to ensure Congress can advance Trump’s priorities, and they emphasize that federal courts allow partisan gerrymandering.
In Kansas City, the redistricting plan has set off a bitter political battle that’s left many people feeling angry and dismissed. Stateline spoke with residents, business owners, activists and local officials in Northeast Kansas City, where three districts would divide the area, to better understand the consequences of the national gerrymandering effort at the local level.
Northeast Kansas City residents and others broadly described a diverse, multicultural community with beautiful architecture, a strong civic fabric and neighborhood pride. In the blocks immediately surrounding the intersection of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, less than a third of residents are non-Hispanic white, according to census data.
At the same time, homelessness and crime can be a part of life. Residents are balancing a need for local investment against the risks of gentrification. The poverty rate fluctuates wildly within the area, from less than 12% of residents in some blocks to more than 63% in others. Vacant storefronts are sometimes only a short walk from colorful, tidy houses.










We need somebody to understand what poverty looks like.

Most community members Stateline spoke with oppose the redistricting effort.
“Nobody asked for this,” said Edgar Palacios, the founder of Latinx Education Collaborative and Revolución Educativa, nonprofit organizations based in Northeast Kansas City that seek to foster Latino representation in education locally. His own home would move into the 4th District under the plan.
Palacios, the son of Nicaraguan immigrants, worried the gerrymander would lead to new representatives for the area who won’t understand the challenges of an urban environment.
“They’re not going to understand the nuances of urban public education and they’re not going to appreciate the differences in how money gets spent or why it gets spent that way or why it’s necessary to do certain things,” Palacios said.
Dan Smith runs Eleos Coffee House on Independence Avenue. The 14-year-old coffee shop is a nondenominational Christian ministry that Smith said draws in both people coming to just work or hang out and individuals off the street wanting help.
Smith declined to offer an opinion on the redistricting proposal, but said he hoped politicians will “totally forget about those lines” when making decisions.
“Because that’s what we have to do here at Eleos,” Smith said. “We can’t draw lines, you know — ‘well, as long as you’re in this group of people or as long as you don’t identify this way or as long as you don’t do this’ — I mean, that’s not helpful for anybody.”
Republicans say maps are improvement
Trump set off a gerrymandering rush this summer in an effort to shore up Republican chances to keep control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
He initially demanded Texas redraw its maps to potentially provide up to five additional GOP seats, and has since urged Republicans in other states to do the same. California has retaliated and other Democratic states may follow.
As Democrats fight ‘fire with fire,’ gerrymandering opponents seek a path forward

Republicans in Missouri and elsewhere have been upfront that they are shuffling the map with the intention of improving their party’s standing and say their efforts are in line with a U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision that greenlit political gerrymandering. Missouri Republicans add that their proposed map splits fewer counties and cities than the current one.
“It is an improvement; it is a reform of our current congressional map,” Missouri state Rep. Dirk Deaton, the Republican sponsor of the legislation, said at a hearing last week in Jefferson City, the state capital.
Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who called a special session to pass the map, said the state’s “conservative, commonsense values, rooted in faith, family and freedom, should be truly represented at all levels of government.” He also wants lawmakers to pass a measure that would pose new hurdles to citizen-proposed constitutional amendments.
Kehoe’s office released only rough outlines of the map. After redistricting legislation was introduced in the Missouri General Assembly last week, Stateline produced a detailed map based on census block information supplied by the Missouri House that shows three congressional districts would meet at Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
Republicans already hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats. Cleaver is one of two Democrats, along with U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of the 1st Congressional District in St. Louis.


At most, the new map would likely enable Republicans to take the 5th Congressional District — a single seat — at the cost of a divided Kansas City.
“Two words. One is ‘horrible’ and the second is ‘divisive,’” Cleaver told reporters in Kansas City recently, summing up his reaction to the map.
Cleaver has promised to file a federal lawsuit challenging the map if it passes (other opponents are expected to file lawsuits in state court as well). Giving one example of how the gerrymander would affect the region, Cleaver said Kansas City Public Schools would have multiple U.S. representatives under the map.
“It’s conceivable that two members of Congress could be fighting each other when legislation occurs where one party takes a position and the other party takes the opposite position,” Cleaver said. “That’s absolutely crazy.”
Kansas City is home to some 516,000 people in an overall metro area of 2.2 million. The city is in the midst of a sports golden era that has been a boost to local pride: The Kansas City Chiefs have appeared in five Super Bowls over the past six years and won three; the city hosted the NFL Draft in 2023; it will host World Cup soccer matches next summer. Music star Taylor Swift’s frequent visits to the metro area to see fiancé Travis Kelce, the Chiefs player, have helped, too.
But gun violence remains a persistent problem. As other major cities have experienced falling homicide rates coming out of the pandemic, Kansas City broke its homicide record in 2023. Killings then fell last year, but nonfatal shootings jumped.
Kansas City leaders say their options to respond are constrained. Unlike nearly every major American city, Kansas City doesn’t control its police force. Instead, city-funded officers are overseen by commissioners almost entirely appointed by the governor, a policy with Civil War-era roots. And Missouri lawmakers have almost entirely preempted the city’s ability to restrict firearms.
For some Kansas Citians, the gerrymandered map strikes them as only the latest instance in a long history of Missouri exercising power with little regard for residents. The map cuts much of Kansas City into two along Troost Avenue — once a dividing line during the era of racial redlining that is still shorthand today for the split between the city’s predominantly white and Black neighborhoods.
“It’s sad that they go to this length to try, in my opinion, to disenfranchise people,” said Lonnie Beattle, a retired postal worker who said she lives in the 18th Street and Vine Street neighborhood that’s south of the Northeast Kansas City area.

Kansas City-Missouri low point
The gerrymander marks a low point in the relationship between Kansas City and the Missouri Capitol, said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
But the second-term mayor, who has battled with Republicans over control of police funding, said that in this instance, the moves by lawmakers have very little do with “purported misbehavior” by the city and more to do with Trump’s demands.
Lucas said carving up Kansas City would mean city officials would have to engage in more lobbying work and more outreach to members of Congress.
“It just adds bureaucracy to a process that currently doesn’t really need it,” Lucas said. “I think everything is working fine right now. One might ask, why change? But obviously, because the president said so.”

While nearly everyone approached by Stateline voiced opposition to the proposed map, the sentiment wasn’t unanimous.
Laura Birdsong, who lives in Northeast Kansas City and calls herself conservative, said that while she understands the concerns, she also sees positives.
“I don’t think it’s an attempt to control, I think it’s an attempt to balance,” Birdsong said as she drove an all-terrain vehicle along Independence Avenue on Friday, shuttling people to and from a local food festival.
Kate Barsotti, a longtime resident of Columbus Park, a neighborhood on the western edge of Northeast Kansas City, said she knew immediately that the gerrymander would be a threat to the neighborhood, dividing it between the 4th and 6th districts. But she suggested the decision could backfire on Republicans.
Barsotti, like others interviewed, emphasized what she views as the absurdity of a congressional district that includes Kansas City stretching all the way to the Illinois border on the eastern edge of the state. Many say that placing so many rural areas into the same district as a dense urban city could upset rural, conservative voters as well.
“So if you want to fight, you’ve just declared war on your own constituents, and I can go anywhere in the state of Missouri and say to them, ‘They don’t care about you,’” Barsotti said.
Some Democrats suspect the party could potentially flip the 4th District, currently held by a Republican, if Kehoe’s proposed map is enacted. Its current boundaries include substantial rural areas but exclude most of the Kansas City metro region. Under the new map, the 4th would slice deep into Kansas City, swallowing up downtown and a lot of Democratic voters in the process.
Lucas said if the map takes effect, he would consider running in 2026 in the 4th District, where he would live. Everyone who cares about representation for Kansas City owes it to the community to make Republicans spend real resources, he said.
“And so I expect there to be a real congressional race,” the mayor said.

Basic needs
At Independence Boulevard Christian Church on Monday afternoon, preparations were already underway for that evening’s meal.
Tables and chairs were set up in a large basement hall, with a separate space available for families. Fugarino, the pastor, said the church expected to serve some kind of ham-and-turkey casserole.
In a few hours, their guests would arrive.
Later that afternoon and 150 miles away at the state Capitol, lawmakers would begin debating the bill that would split apart the crossroads of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
“I think the whole point,” Fugarino said in an interview about the gerrymander, “has nothing to do with trying to address what citizens are actually needing.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Highway Patrol has revised its drug arrest numbers for a recent saturation patrol, saying it jailed fewer than half of the people its original terminology suggested.
Last week, Gov. Larry Rhoden gave South Dakota Searchlight and several other media outlets a list of arrests from the first saturation patrol conducted in Sioux Falls by his administration’s “Operation Prairie Thunder” public safety campaign.
The list included 174 arrests for drugs, 44 of which involved felony drugs. 
First state-funded ‘Prairie Thunder’ patrol results in 44 felony drug arrests in Sioux Falls

Over the weekend, however, The Dakota Scout newspaper reported that those arrest numbers did not square with the number of people who were arrested. 
The governor’s office did not dispute the newspaper’s findings, even as Rhoden told the paper he was still pleased with the results.
The Highway Patrol said it uses the words “arrest” and “citation” interchangeably, and that a single person could be cited multiple times.
The agency has done so for years, Highway Patrol spokesman Brad Reiners said in an email to South Dakota Searchlight on Monday, including in its daily “rally tally” of arrests during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
“The way they are counted fits our reporting system, but not necessarily the way the public perceives the numbers,” Reiners wrote.
According to a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the Highway Patrol said that the 174 charges reported for the three-day saturation patrol in Sioux Falls were filed against 78 people. 
Of those, 51 were booked into jail, and 27 were “arrested, cited and released with a notice to appear.”
In a statement, Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve Long said the agency “apologizes for the confusion regarding the statistical reporting,” and that in the future, Highway Patrol press releases will “accurately reflect the number of unique individuals arrested in addition to the number of total charges filed.”
“Nonetheless, the results continue to reflect the significant positive impact Operation: Prairie Thunder has to reduce criminal activity,” Long wrote.

(Getty Images)Three state Supreme Court justices offered a glimpse behind their chambers doors Monday as they seek voters’ approval in November to serve second terms.
Judges in Pennsylvania are elected to 10-year terms in partisan elections. Once in office, however, they stand for retention in “yes” or “no” referenda to serve subsequent terms.
Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht were elected as Democrats in 2015 in a historic race where three of the seven Supreme Court seats were up for grabs for the first time in the court’s 300-year history.
This year, the same trio of justices are up for retention. In a “fireside chat” led by WHYY-FM’s Cherri Gregg, Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht spoke about judicial independence, the court’s deliberative process and and to dispel the idea that their decisions are politically driven.
The event was co-sponsored by the court access group Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, the government watchdog Committee of Seventy and the Pennsylvania League of Women Voters.
In the last decade the Supreme Court has issued pivotal opinions allowing school districts to sue the governor and General Assembly over the state’s education funding system, allowing mail ballots with inconsequential flaws to be counted and upheld state emergency orders closing businesses to slow the spread of COVID-19.
“The independence of the judiciary is an amazing piece of our Pennsylvania Constitution,” Dougherty said. “It’s a sacred part of our constitution that, for some reason, people believe should just be a suggestion.”
As the third branch of government, the judiciary provides a check and balance on the legislative and executive branches to ensure that neither abuses its authority, Dougherty noted. Wecht added its roles include interpreting the state constitution, which defines and limits the powers of the other two branches.

“The constitution is the fundamental law and is superior to a legislative enactment. So there are times when the court must stand against the popular will … So it’s not for the faint hearted,” Wecht said.
And Donohue said the court often delves into the English and colonial law that preceded the state constitution to determine what its authors intended.
“For many years, the Supreme Court did not spend a whole lot of time on Pennsylvania constitutional rights, and it is, needless to say, one of the most important things that we do,” she said.
The unprecedented 2015 election flipped the court to a 5-2 majority of justices who were elected as Democrats. Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht joined now-Chief Justice Debra Todd and then-Chief Justice Max Baer.
Justice Daniel McCaffrey’s election as a Democrat in 2023, maintained the majority despite outside spending by conservatives attacking him. With more than $19.5 million spent by McCaffery, his Republican opponent, Montgomery County Judge Carolyn Carluccio, and third parties, the election shattered the previous record in 2015.
This year, according to Meta and Google, the Republican State Leadership Committee has already spent at least $91,000 on digital ads urging Republicans to vote by mail to defeat “radical liberal judges … trying to secure another decade of power.”
Gregg asked the justices how they ensure that their rulings are not political and are grounded in the law and constitution. 
Donohue replied that the courts are required to follow rules to interpret the law and ascertain the intent of lawmakers, sometimes decades or centuries after a law was enacted. In interpreting the constitution, the courts look at how its provisions have been applied through history and how earlier laws might have informed its framers.
“Our personal views, our political views, our religious views, are left on the wayside. They have absolutely nothing to do with the manner in which we can decide cases, and do decide cases,” Donohue said.
Dougherty said that’s borne out in the 10 years of decisions each justice has authored and voted on, noting that they have taken stances that could be considered adverse to political or ideological labels. 
“The constitution required us to run as a partisan, but the moment we were elected, when we put that black robe on, we hung up that partisan title,” he said.

Wecht added that the seven justices never think of a Democratic or a Republican outcome in a case. Rather, they apply the law as they interpret it, following predictable rules.
“We have no choice but to apply the law that the legislature has given us, and any one of us, or all of us, or some mix of us may think the result stinks, but it’s not our business to decide whether we like the result or not,” Wecht said.
In many cases, the court is bound by the doctrine of stare decisis, the Latin phrase meaning “to stand by things decided,” which requires judges to look at how the law has developed over time and follow earlier decisions.
Wecht was the subject of a state lawmaker’s call to impeach him in 2020 amid allegations that he had overstepped the court’s authority by legislating from the bench. Former Rep. Frank Ryan (R-Lebanon) cited Wecht’s 2018 decision on congressional redistricting and upholding former Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-19 emergency orders in 2020.
Gregg asked Wecht what he learned from the redistricting case. Calling the Republican-controlled legislature’s map “flamboyantly gerrymandered” and “grossly improper,” Wecht said he found out the people behind such an impropriety are going to be “very upset” when a court strikes it down.
“It’s a fundamental principle in our system that if one seeks to recuse a jurist, one makes a motion in advance of the proceeding, one doesn’t wait for the result to see if one likes the result, and then complain that maybe that person shouldn’t have participated,” he said.
Describing the court’s day-to-day work, Dougherty said the court is unique in the commonwealth because it decides what cases it wants to hear, and it accepts only 5% to 8% of the requests that come before it. There are exceptions such as death penalty cases and Gaming Act appeals that the court must hear.
Each justice reviews about 300 requests a year and author memoranda recommending whether to accept or deny them.  Their colleagues don’t always agree, so there are often responses before a decision whether to consider a case is finally made, Dougherty said. 
Meanwhile, the justices must review case files for the cases they have agreed to consider and write opinions for those they have heard. That’s on top of the administrative tasks of attorney discipline or appointing people to serve on committees that draft court rules and procedures. 
“So each day, every day, it’s a product of intellectual jumping jacks, and each chamber permits itself to determine what it finds to be the priority at that particular moment,” Dougherty said.
Audio from the court’s oral arguments, where attorneys for each side present their cases, are broadcast on the Pennsylvania Cable Network (PCN) and on the court’s YouTube channel. Donohue said those arguments give listeners, including the justices themselves, a strong indication of what each justice is thinking about a case.
Immediately after arguments, the justices have an administrative session behind closed doors where they take preliminary votes on the cases they have just heard. Sometimes the justices discuss the case to narrow the issues on which they will focus. 
Each case is assigned to a justice to author a preliminary majority opinion that is circulated among his or her colleagues. Then, any dissenting opinions are drafted and the majority responds, Donohue said.
“That’s where the debate happens,” she said, adding that sometimes there are discussions between the justices to fine tune the majority ruling to accommodate disagreements on fine points of law and in others individual justices write concurring opinions in which they explain how they would have decided the case differently to reach the same result as the majority.
“Votes can change. Alterations can happen in opinions. And really, the public sees the tip of the iceberg,” Wecht said. “Maybe a better metaphor than an iceberg, is a water polo game where you see the ball up here, but you don’t see the kicking and gouging going on underneath the surface.”

The report, from a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services focused on children, found that Connecticut was not in “substantial conformity” with any of the outcome measurements for foster kids’ well-being that the federal government examines regularly. The state was only in conformity with two of seven factors the federal government reviewed.
“We have a very serious problem in terms of being unable to meet the needs of the most vulnerable children in our state,” said Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy.
Many of the problems addressed in the report were tied to a lack of resources, Eagan said. She questioned whether DCF has been seeking enough funding from the state.
HHS conducts regular audits of states’ child welfare agencies, including the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. This latest report, known as the Child and Family Services Reviews, or CFSR, was based on information gathered from July 2024 to March 2025.
The agency also found that Connecticut does well at placing siblings together, relocating kids removed from their homes into relatives’ homes, meeting the educational needs of children in foster care, and assessing kids’ needs.
Still, the report concluded that Connecticut should be placed on a performance improvement plan until the state makes progress toward meeting federal markers. It’s difficult to meet those markers, which have high standards. Most states missed markers in their audits.
“The CFSR sends a clear message that Connecticut has a lot of work to do to improve outcomes for children and families served by the Department,” said Christina Ghio, the state’s acting child advocate, in a statement.
Ghio said the Office of the Child Advocate is primarily concerned with inconsistent safety practices, lack of mental health services, permanent stability for children in foster care and delays in reunifications.
Interim DCF Commissioner Susan Hamilton said in a statement that her department has successfully completed performance improvement plans in the past, adding, “one will be submitted in the near future in collaboration with other system partners to address the highlighted areas consistent with all states across the country.” She said the state’s child welfare system “remains committed to continuous learning and reform to strengthen outcomes for the children and families we collectively serve.”
Hamilton went on to note that the CFSR had highlighted some of Connecticut’s strengths, “such as kinship care, sibling placements, thorough behavioral health assessments, and strong community engagement— which are a direct reflection of our core values of family-centered practice, partnership, and a robust Quality Assurance System that drives continuous improvement.” She said the department had already “identified areas of focus to enhance our work.”
The report’s findings
The federal analysts found that DCF workers weren’t consistent with their safety-related practices, especially with in-home services. In-person contacts with children involved in investigations weren’t always timely, and there weren’t adequate services provided for homes with risk factors such as domestic violence or substance abuse.
The agency also had limited ability to meet behavioral health needs, the report said.
The federal auditors conducted interviews with people involved in the system who said there were problems with long waitlists, a limited workforce and transportation availability to and from service providers.
Eagan said inadequate funding has affected access to many aspects of the state’s social safety net. Providers of those services say the problem stems, in part, from the state’s adherence to a slate of “fiscal guardrails,” which have constrained what they see as necessary state spending. 
“None of these agencies are operating with enough funds to serve the people that depend on them,” Eagan said. “And that’s a big part of this here.”
Ghio said many of the problems mentioned in the report have also come up in investigations her office conducts. “The state must work to develop an adequate service array to ensure that families receive the services they need, both to prevent removal and support reunification whenever removal is necessary,” she said in a statement.
Connecticut also had challenges with finding permanent places for children in foster care to live, whether the goal was adoption or reunification with their parents. Those plans weren’t enacted as quickly as the federal government wanted, which is typically within 15 months.
Some of this was due to delays in court, either because of the time it took DCF to provide paperwork, or due to rescheduled hearings or judge availability, the report said.
“The ‘delays’ are much more complicated than how it is written and captured in the report,” Judge Tammy Nguyen-O’Dowd, chief administrative judge of juvenile matters, said in a statement.
Nguyen-O’Dowd said many people, including at least four attorneys, have to coordinate on court dates and that the number of attorneys working on juvenile matters with the Office of the Chief Public Defender is limited. She also said that DCF makes decisions on when to file petitions for the termination of parental rights.
The rate of children being mistreated in foster care also increased between fiscal years 2020 and 2022. The rate of maltreatment victims aged 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 doubled, and those ages 11 to 16 increased fivefold, according to the report.
“With regard to placement stability, there is no question that moving from place to place is harmful to children,” Ghio, the acting child advocate, said. “While Connecticut may still be within the national performance expectation, we are trending in the wrong direction. We do not have enough foster homes to meet the need.”
The federal agency also reported issues with access to services, particularly for biological families and fathers. The report said it was a “significant area of concern,” to ensure that “parents have enhanced capacity to provide for their children.”
The report also said DCF has a good quality assurance system and does good work planning for multiple goals for children and families.
Advocates said the results of this study and other reports such as a recent audit about kids missing from care and OCA reports are worthy of attention.
“That’s the core problem that we’re dealing with in this state is an ever-eroding capacity to meet the needs of vulnerable people, and nobody pays the price worse for that than children,” Eagan said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3936-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 16:57:32.829844

Article Summary

Justice P. Scott Neville Jr. was elected by his colleagues to become the state’s next chief justice, beginning in October.
Chief justices in Illinois are elected by their colleagues to serve three-year terms.
Neville has served on the court since 2018 and will become the state’s second Black chief justice. The first was his predecessor on the court, Justice Charles Freeman.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Supreme Court announced Tuesday that Justice P. Scott Neville Jr. has been chosen to be the state’s 123rd chief justice, succeeding Mary Jane Theis, whose three-year term as head of the court expires Oct. 26.
Theis, who was named chief justice in 2022, will remain on the court as an associate justice.
Neville, 76, has served on the court since 2018 when he was appointed to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Charles Freeman. He was elected to a 10-year term in 2020. He previously served as an appellate court justice and as a Cook County circuit court judge.
According to a release from the court, Neville began his legal career as the first Black law clerk for a Cook County appellate justice. Later, he practiced civil law and appellate law, which included helping prosecute a lawsuit over the 1992 redistricting of Chicago’s 50 wards.
Neville received a bachelor of arts degree from Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Missouri, and a juris doctorate from Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.
In a statement, Neville said public trust in the courts “requires justice that is accessible, procedures that are understandable, and support services that meet the needs of litigants.”
“I will always work to make the Illinois courts a national model, safeguarding the constitutional promise of equal justice without regard to who a person is, where they live, or what resources they have so all litigants are seen and heard,” he said.
The Illinois Supreme Court is composed of seven justices who are elected by districts in partisan races. Under the Illinois Constitution, three justices are chosen from Cook County and the other four are elected from downstate in districts that are drawn by the General Assembly and are supposed to be roughly equal in population.
The justices elect a chief justice to a three-year term from within their own ranks. The post typically goes to the most senior justice who has not already served a term as chief justice.
Neville will become the state’s second Black chief justice after Freeman, who held the post from 1997 to 2000.
The chief justice’s duties include overseeing the administration of Illinois courts and more than 900 judges, supervising appointments to Supreme Court committees, leading the Illinois Judicial Conference and presenting the court’s annual budget to the General Assembly.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds has returned to India with a delegation from Iowa this week, following up from trade discussions that began during her first visit in 2024.
Reynolds had first visited India with Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, Iowa Economic Development Authority and Iowa Finance Authority Director Debi Durham and Iowa agricultural and business leaders, for a 10-day mission in September 2024. She and other state leaders discussed trade opportunities with business and government leaders between Iowa and India in areas like biofuel, commodity crops and agricultural technology.
The governor is joined by many of the same Iowans, including Naig and Durham, on this year’s trip, which kicked off Sept. 6. The eight-day trip includes visits to Delhi, Pune, and Mumbai.
In a news release, the governor’s office stated the purpose of the trip is to “build on relationships established during an initial visit a year ago and to further explore growth opportunities with one of the world’s largest emerging economies.”
“Our visit to India last year kicked off a number of relationships between Iowa and Indian businesses and trade associations and furthered conversations on investing in Iowa and market access for certain Iowa agricultural products,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I look forward to further solidifying those relationships and establishing new connections on which to build.”
Reynolds and Naig gave remarks Monday at DialogueNEXT, a symposium hosted by the World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines. At the event, Reynolds told attendees that Iowa farmers “produce 10 percent of America’s food supply with less than 1 percent of its population” — and that the state is a center for innovation in both agriculture and energy production.
“From precision agriculture and biotechnology to renewable fuels and soil conservation, we are constantly working to improve yields, protect the environment, and make food systems more sustainable,” Reynolds said in her keynote address. “And we recognize that food security is inseparable from energy security. Iowa leads America in renewable fuels production. Ethanol and biodiesel provide affordable, clean energy that supports farmers while helping countries like India diversify their energy sources and reduce emissions.”
Reynolds said India plays a vital role in building food and energy security, saying “by combining Iowa’s agricultural innovation with India’s scale, talent, and growing market, we can create new pathways to feed the world.”
The governor also met with the Sehgal Foundation, an Indian nongovernmental organization focused on sustainable agricultural practices.
The trip, organized by IEDA with support from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi and Consulate in Mumbai, includes roundtable discussions with the U.S.-India Business Council, the U.S. Soybean Export Council and the U.S. Grains Council later this week. Reynolds is also scheduled to attend a partner state signing ceremony Friday between Iowa and Maharashtra, a western state of India that contains the cities of Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune.
The India visit is one of several international trade missions Reynolds has joined in recent years, as the governor has stated that Iowa should focus on expanding their influence through new global markets. She has also led a trade mission to Italy, Kosovo and Israel in 2023.
The trade mission comes amid heightened U.S. tariffs on goods from India. The tariffs of 50% on goods from India was implemented in late August, as President Donald Trump sought to take action to penalize. the country for its purchase of Russian oil and weapons during the Russia-Ukraine war.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reynolds-india-trade-2024-_-cami-koons-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-09 16:57:32.829844

Robert Anderson, Maria Hernandez and Silvia Ramos — all of whom are charged with mishandling voters’ absentee ballots — took turns entering their pleas in Bridgeport Superior Court and were ordered to return to court in November for their next hearing.
Elsie Mercado, who faces similar charges, is scheduled to enter a plea on Sept. 25. 
The four political operatives are the latest people to be charged with mishandling absentee ballots in Bridgeport, Connecticut’s largest city, during the city’s two most recent mayoral elections.

Their criminal cases will now be managed alongside the charges leveled against six other Bridgeport political players, including several current and former city council members and the vice chairwoman of Bridgeport Democratic party.
During the hearing on Tuesday, the judge listened to the various defense attorneys discuss whether they’ve received all of the evidence compiled against their clients as part of the sprawling criminal investigation. 
Most of the cases were reset for another hearing on Nov. 4.

But Jazmarie Melendez, one of the defendants accused of violating the state’s absentee ballot laws, told the judge that she would not be entertaining any plea offers from prosecutors and planned to proceed to a jury trial. 
Melendez, who stepped down the from the Bridgeport city council earlier this year, has been accused by prosecutors of misrepresenting the requirements to vote via absentee ballot.

Her defense attorney, Alex Taubes, told the judge that his client would not be seeking a deal with prosecutors because his client did not violate the law.
The judge asked Melendez whether she was aware of the consequences of the jury trial if she is found guilty of the charges against her. And Melendez said she understood the consequences. 
It’s unclear how quickly the jury trial in Melendez’s case could be set. 
Seven other Bridgeport political operatives — including several members of the city council and the vice chairwoman of the Bridgeport Democratic Party — were previously charged with absentee ballot crimes in connection with 2019 and 2023 Democratic primaries.
The city made national news in the fall of 2023 after surveillance footage emerged showing numerous political operatives allegedly stuffing ballots into four different drop boxes located throughout the city.
Those videos set of a tsunami of complaints that were submitted to the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which is responsible for investigating allegations of voter fraud.

Last week, a federal appeals court ruled that Wisconsin doesn't need to comply with stricter air quality rules to decrease smog in three southeastern Wisconsin counties. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)A federal appeals court has ruled that the state of Wisconsin and businesses operating in certain parts of southeastern Wisconsin will not be required to meet more stringent air quality standards for ozone pollution — giving state regulators and industry a reprieve from what they say were “costly and burdensome requirements.”
On Friday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the state’s request to temporarily postpone a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Late last year, the EPA reclassified areas of Milwaukee, Kenosha and Sheboygan counties as being in “serious nonattainment” of the agency’s 2015 ozone standards. In February, the state filed a lawsuit for the review of the EPA finding. 
The enforcement of the EPA standard would have forced the state to revise its plan for complying with national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, and hundreds of businesses would have had to assess if their existing permits need to be renewed or revised. The state complained that these measures would have cost the Department of Natural Resources and the state’s businesses millions of dollars when most of the ozone pollution over the areas is caused elsewhere and settles over southeast Wisconsin after drifting across Lake Michigan. 
Environmental groups have said that even if Wisconsin’s industries aren’t creating most of the ozone pollution, the businesses have a duty to work to protect the health and well-being of the state’s residents. In 2018, Clean Wisconsin sued the EPA to force the agency to declare the three southeastern Wisconsin counties aren’t complying with federal air quality rules. 
Ozone pollution, also known as smog, occurs most often in the summer when air pollution from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes reacts with sunlight. The pollution can be harmful to people’s respiratory systems. 
“The fact that southeastern Wisconsin has been reclassified as in serious nonattainment for ozone means that residents of those counties are at higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and Wisconsin should be implementing all possible policies and strategies to reduce ozone pollution to protect public health,” Clean Wisconsin attorney Katie Nekola said in a statement to Wisconsin Public Radio. 
But business groups and the state have argued the costs are too high for a problem that doesn’t start in Wisconsin. DNR analysis has found that less than 10% of the ozone pollution in the state is caused by Wisconsin industry. 
The state Department of Justice said in its lawsuit that the “change triggers costly permit requirements, complex regulations, and stringent emissions offset mandates,” which could create $4 million in added costs for the state and cost an estimated 382 businesses between $1 million and $6.9 million.
Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said the court’s Friday order grants relief from the “crushing and job-killing ozone regulations.” 
“Data from both the DNR and EPA indicate that the vast majority of ozone pollution in eastern Wisconsin is caused by emissions originating from outside our state borders,” Manley said in a statement. “It’s unfair to punish Wisconsin businesses for pollution they didn’t create, and [the] order is the first step toward righting this wrong.”

(Photo by Lue Palmer/Verite News)Extended heatwaves in New Orleans have been tied to spikes in domestic violence-related calls, according to a new, robust peer-reviewed study.
Dangerously hot days are on the rise as the climate changes due to human-caused global warming. This year, New Orleans has faced 20 heat advisories and three extreme heat warnings, according to the National Weather Service. Published Aug. 29 in JAMA Network Open, the research found that the longer residents experience extreme heat, the more likely the weather could turn into a trigger for violence between intimate partners.
Projections show lengthy heatwaves will occur even more frequently in the coming decades, potentially exacerbating the city’s existing problems with domestic violence. The study’s authors said they believe the study shows the city should integrate its heat-mitigation strategies with its efforts to limit violence, especially between partners.
“A lot of people know alcohol can be a trigger. This research lets people know heat can be a trigger. It’s not an excuse, there’s never an excuse for domestic violence. But this could be one of those things to elevate your risk,” said Newcomb Institute executive director Anita Raj, whose institute helped conduct the research.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The study reviewed more than 150,000 calls to the New Orleans Police Department related to domestic violence from 2011 to 2021, matching the daily call volume to the weather conditions in each zip code.
Emergency calls related to domestic violence were 4% more likely when the average temperature stayed above 86 degrees for at least five days. At even hotter temperatures, the odds worsened.
“What we find is that a prolonged exposure appears to have a cumulative effect on stress and intrusive behavior,” said the study’s lead author, Arnab Dey, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. “So our theory is that a single hot day might be more manageable, but when people experience multiple consecutive days of extreme heat, especially without adequate cooling, the physiological and the psychological stress would build up.”
The study estimated that about 245 domestic violence-related calls may have been avoided if not for the heat. Raj and Dey noted that their police data likely significantly underestimates the number of incidents as people often call 911 in the most severe cases.
“It’s likely just the tip of the iceberg,” Raj said.
‘Heat in particular does create agitation’
Dey and Raj said they hope, given the early warnings available for extreme heat, public officials can help raise the public’s awareness of this connection by including domestic violence as one of the risks during a heatwave. In New Orleans, heatwaves lasting at least three days could be 85% more likely in 30 years, according to an analysis by the First Street Foundation.
“Heat in particular does create agitation, and, for some, that agitation can move towards aggression,” Raj said. “
Other studies have documented how gun violence also becomes more likely when it’s hot outside. Research linking aggression to heat also goes back decades. Raj said she would like to see reminders to the public about the psychological effect of heat and messages like: “Stay cool in body, stay cool in mind.”
Raj said the research will be shared with advocates for domestic violence survivors and prevention, as well as city officials, to help shape their work.
Eva Lessinger is the co-director of Beyond Harm, an advocacy group that provides intervention services to stop the cycle of domestic violence outside of the criminal justice system. She said this type of information can help to mitigate domestic violence but stressed that heat, or other factors like alcohol use, does not cause domestic violence.
“There’s so many things that can exacerbate an already violent situation,” Lessinger said, noting alcohol, mental illness, stress and poverty on top of heat. “But I don’t think anything really causes domestic violence except the person who is using the violence. … A pattern of control over your partner isn’t going anywhere, even during the winter.”
Lessinger said there’s still controversy over what exactly causes domestic violence, but one theory is that it relies on a person creating a belief system that allows them to justify the abuse of another due to their life experiences. Disrupting and changing those beliefs can require intervention programs involving tactics like accountability groups, therapy and case management, like Beyond Harm’s offers.
While understanding the link between heat and domestic violence won’t solve the epidemic, Lessinger said she agreed with the importance of taking a holistic approach to how human behavior can be affected by climate.
Raj said he hopes to see more research examining the relationship between climate hazards and public health as extreme heat grows more intense, frequent and longer. Humid heat is especially concerning because it’s known to affect the body more severely, yet much is still unknown about how the rapid changes are affecting human well-being.
“With that increased intensity, the problem becomes more serious,” Raj said. “It behooves us to act very fast and use all the knowledge that we have to address these problems that are coming.”

Details are so scant that even veteran lobbyists and advocates say they are confused and frustrated.","In summary
With just days until the legislative session wraps, California’s top Democrats are discussing a series of climate, energy and transit measures in backrooms. Details are so scant that even veteran lobbyists and advocates say they are confused and frustrated.


California’s top Democrats entered the final stretch of the legislative session with an ambitious list of priorities: Pass some of the state’s most consequential climate and energy reforms, hash out a $750 million transit loan, and dampen the impact of federal funding slashes.
But with days left, details are murky on nearly all of it.
Welcome to one of the most secretive yet commonplace practices in Sacramento, where each year, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and their staff meet in private to reach last-minute agreements on major policy changes and funding allocations before the clock runs out. 
Those deals — often unveiled at the 11th hour — will likely become law as is, because there is little to no room for changes by the time they are announced. And there’s rarely any appetite or momentum among the Democratic supermajority to tinker with the final product of the top Democrats’ negotiations. 
This year, as talks stall, the future of California’s environmental policies hangs in the balance. Still up in the air are proposals to reauthorize cap and trade, the state’s signature climate program that charges polluters to emit greenhouse gas, until 2045; create a regional electricity market with other western states; replenish the state’s wildfire funds and boost in-state oil production. 
To accomplish that before session ends on Friday, lawmakers must finalize the language of those proposals and put it in print by early Wednesday morning, as required by a 2016 voter-approved law designed to give the public at least 72 hours to review bills before they are voted on. 
But the leaders had announced no deals by Monday and released no details about the talks on any of the environmental issues. Frustrated, some lobbyists and advocates turned to leaked draft language by news outlets for information. The down-to-the-wire dealmaking drew fierce opposition from trade groups and environmental justice advocates alike, who urged lawmakers to avoid a hasty deal.
Details on state lawmakers’ other policy reforms — introduced as “budget trailer bills” that govern how state funds are spent — just started to roll out early Tuesday morning. And the fate of the transit funding, which advocates say would keep the Bay Area’s transit systems from collapsing, remains obscure as talks continue. 
No one from the governor’s office or the legislative leaders’ offices responded to CalMatters’ questions about the private negotiations by press time.
‘The way our system works’
The secretive process is par for the course, but it’s notable that so many of the most consequential issues are still unknown. 
Former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat running to be the state superintendent of public instruction, said withholding details of negotiated deals until the last minute raises their chances of passing by allowing lobbyists less time to object and lawmakers less time to mull over their votes.
“A kicker is about to kick a game-winning field goal and you call a timeout to make them nervous. The longer things go on, the more nervous people get,” he said. 
“Is that the best thing to do? Is that the most democratic thing to do? No. That’s the way our system works.”
Transparency advocates argue the public should have more, not less, time to review and weigh in on legislative proposals before they become law.
“If we are pushing things ‘til the very end of session, and there is no meaningful opportunity for the public to engage, then you are putting reporters and the public in a position of getting to digest what the new law is, instead of being able to … at least let their concerns be heard,” said Brittney Barsotti, a lobbyist for the California News Publishers Association.
Some lobbyists bemoaned the lack of transparency, arguing the uncertainty made their jobs more difficult. 
“It’s hard to know sometimes what we are advocating (for) because so many of the details have yet to be released,” said Victoria Rome, a longtime lobbyist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports the reauthorization of cap and trade and a regional electricity market. 
“We’re kind of just waiting and hoping that it’s something that we can support,” she said. “(It’s) like, are we needed at all?”
“Is that the best thing to do? Is that the most democratic thing to do? No. That’s the way our system works.” former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon
The looming uncertainty is already undermining Democratic leaders’ climate agenda. Jodie Muller, chief executive of the powerful oil industry lobbying group Western States Petroleum Association, criticized lawmakers for not releasing any bill language on cap and trade despite months of conversations. The organization joined other lobbying juggernauts on Monday to oppose the reauthorization of the program.
“To be rushing something through is the wrong approach,” Muller told CalMatters. “No deal is going to be better than a bad deal.”
Governing by trailer bills
While the fate of climate policies remains elusive, lawmakers on Monday night began rolling out a series of budget trailer bills. Those measures allow lawmakers to pass last-minute laws without going through the monthslong public hearing process, and have become vehicles for both major reforms and pet projects for lawmakers in recent years.
The governor and legislative leaders have increasingly used the budget process and trailer bills to swiftly enact laws. Earlier this year, a sweeping proposal to uproot California’s landmark environmental law to make way for urban residential development was tucked into a budget trailer bill, Rome noted. 
“It just makes it even harder for advocates and the public to track what’s going on,” she said.

One trailer bill this week seeks to address the impact of federal funding cuts to Medicaid under President Donald Trump, which Newsom and state officials estimated could cost the state $28.4 billion. The bill, details of which were published Tuesday morning, would provide funding for abortion services, exempt more undocumented immigrants from paying monthly Medi-Cal premiums and establish the state’s own vaccine guidance as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention restricts COVID-19 vaccine eligibility. 
Another trailer bill on land use, released late Monday night, includes language that critics say is narrowly tailored to kill a controversial apartment complex project in Santa Barbara. The bill would apply environmental regulations now exempted for most urban developments to projects that meet a whole set of narrowly defined criteria on population, location and acreage. 
The only project to meet all the criteria is a proposed 270-unit apartment building in Santa Barbara, where newly elected Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón resides, said housing advocate Jordan Grimes.
“Is the incoming leader of the California senate sneakily trying to kill” the project? Grimes asked. “It certainly seems like it!”
In a statement Tuesday, Limón denied the accusation, calling the legislation a “cleanup bill” requiring environmental reviews when a development poses a risk to safety, rather than a specific carve-out to block one project. She did not immediately point to other projects that also fit the bill.
Transit funding flip-flop
In the Bay Area, transit advocates are experiencing a rollercoaster ride amid the on-again, off-again backroom negotiations over a $750 million loan to tide over Bay Area’s regional transit net, as transit operators warn of service cuts.
While the loan was included in a June budget agreement, Newsom and Bay Area lawmakers tussled over the loan terms. Last Friday, Newsom’s Department of Finance alerted Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who’s pushed for transit funding for years, that the deal would not be finalized. Yet on Monday, following a weekend of calls from San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and union workers, Newsom said he looks forward to striking a deal in the fall. 
But it is unclear why Newsom changed his mind and when a deal might be reached. Both Newsom and Wiener declined to elaborate on their differences or how a deal would be implemented after the Legislature leaves Sacramento this Friday. 
“We don’t have an agreement with the administration, so there’s nothing to disclose,” Wiener told CalMatters. “Once there’s an agreement, that’ll be completely public and transparent.”
The flip-flop left some Democrats frustrated. 
“I expect better of Democratic leaders,” said Matt Dorsey, a Democrat and District 6 Supervisor of San Francisco. “I would expect chaos and uncertainty from the Republicans in Washington — but with the eyes of America on our city and our state, let’s show them how Democrats can govern equitably so that we’ve got transit and paratransit and all the economic opportunities.”

A coalition of advocates and lawmakers behind the bills held a news conference on Tuesday to discuss the legislation, and the need for a Michigan ratepayers’ “bill of rights.”
The legislation would protect utility customers in Michigan from policies that allow the state’s utilities – DTE Energy Company and Consumers Energy – to prioritize people over profits. It also stands to face a tough road ahead, as it’s unclear how the Republican-controlled House of Representatives might view the policies.
Even if the package is produced in the Senate and passes muster with the Democrats in control of the chamber, the package could meet a tough landing in the House before it reaches Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s desk.
A message seeking comment from the House Republican caucus on the legislation was not returned at the time of publication.
State Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) said the bill of rights being crafted by Democrats in the House and Senate is long overdue. First and foremost, McKinney said the legislation would guarantee Michiganders have the right to fair compensation when power goes out for long periods of time, including renters.
“Other states have done this. So can Michigan,” McKinney said. “We’re going to start tying any rate increases to the performance of the utility companies. You know, that novel concept in this country that you have to do a good job to get paid. It’s called performance-based rate making, and it’s being done in other places. This rate payer Bill of Rights also cracks down on utility companies that make everyday households pay for the perks of millionaire utility executives with auto control salaries.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The proposed bill of rights would also ensure residents no longer pay the highest energy costs in the Midwest; protect residents from paying for CEO bonuses and other luxuries; ban political contributions to state lawmakers from the utilities; and ensure residents can generate their own reliable energy through solar arrays on their homes or with their neighbors.
Katie Carey, a spokesperson for Consumers Energy, told Michigan Advance in a statement that the company’s rates are used to invest in the natural gas or electric system, and that delivers reliable and affordable energy to their customers. 

“Specifically for the electric side of the business, our Reliability Roadmap has delivered meaningful results in 2024 to customers, including a 12% reduction in the amount of time an average customer went without power,” Carey said. “We have mapped out the strategy and tactics that should continue leading to fewer and shorter power outages and hope other stakeholders will work with us to help us serve Michigan.”
A message seeking comment from DTE was not returned at the time of publication.
Still, Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township), said Michigan residents are faced with prices going up on all manner of goods and services, and that’s forced some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens to make choices on whether to pay for other things instead of their utility bills. If they can’t pay, Shink said those services would be cut off by the provider, which could be detrimental during days of high heat in the summer or trembling cold in the winter months.
The biggest hurdle is out of control energy costs, Shink added.
“Michiganders are watching with dismay as the two utilities file for another $1 billion rate hike. The outrageous thing is that DTE submitted this latest rate hike just a couple months after receiving a $217 million increase on all of us, and not even two years before that, they fought for a $368 million rate hike,” Shink said. “Now they’re asking to increase our rate by another 11%.”
Nessel seeks to slash DTE half-billion-dollar rate hike request by 75%

Shink said that DTE shareholders were paid $835 million in 2024 and maintained some of the worst utility service in the nation.
“Meanwhile, DTE’s CEO last year made $12.8 million. That’s a 23% increase over his salary the year before,” Shinki said. “I want to break that down just a little bit. At $12.8 million a year, that’s $213,000 a month. That’s $46,900 a day. That’s almost two times the salary of a minimum wage earner per year in a day. … That’s just wrong.”
Shink and other legislators attending the news conference said their response to a broken system was a new bill of rights to balance the scales.
“It’s the antidote to how we address energy affordability issues and bring prices down in Michigan. It’s how we restore trust with our constituents who want to know that policy makers are setting energy policy, not utility CEOs and their lobbyists,” Shink said. “Things have gotten so bad that residents in my district, in Ann Arbor, announced recently that they are launching a local ballot initiative to establish our own municipal power system in order to cut ties with DTE altogether.”

Michigan remains at the bottom in the nation for electric reliability and has some of the highest rates.
McKinney said that was because the utilities have not invested enough into bolstering the state’s grid despite the large sums of money those companies rake in.
“The neglect over years has been so detrimental that in testimony, DTE, I believe, had said that they have power lines in operation from the early 1900s still in operation today,” McKinney said. “No wonder the power keeps going out when there’s just a little bit of wind and the sun is out like today. People are fed up.”
Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) added that the grid was in such dire shape because utilities have “pocketed the profits rather than investing in people.”
“Now they’re asking us to pay for them to actually do their job and provide reliable power,” Morgan said. “I think the ultimate cause of that is the money that they have contributed in our political system. That has had a significant role in legislators over the last several decades, now holding them accountable to the people.”
As to whether Republicans in the House will support the measures, McKinney told reporters at the news conference that issue of high utility rates with lackluster service affects every Michigander, regardless of the political affiliation.
Ann Arbor residents plan ballot initiative to dump DTE and begin shifting city toward public power

“Every single Michigan out there, we’re hearing your voice, no matter if you’re Democrat, Republican, independent, it doesn’t matter,” McKinney said. “I’m getting calls every single day about this issue. I got Republicans who hate my guts, but they’re like, ‘Hey, we’re with you on this issue.’”
A separate ballot proposal being shopped by Michiganders for Money Out of Politics also seeks to address the influence utilities have in state politics. The proposal would ban political contributions from the companies, which are considered regulated monopolies.
The Michigan Board of State Canvassers approved the proposal for signature collection in August.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission heard public feedback Tuesday on the possibility of changing state ethics rules to limit lobbyists’ influence on the lawmaking process.  
But before the public had their say, ethics commission chair Lauren E. Jones wanted to correct the public record.
“The press has had this wrong,” Jones began. “We have not proposed to change any rule. We have proposed to consider whether to change the rules. The fact that this is set up for a public hearing today does not mean at all that this commission has made any decision on any of the proposed amendments to rules and regulations.” 
The potential changes are twofold: One proposed by lawmakers would increase the permissible amount of individual gifts to public officials from $25 to $50 and from $75 to $150 annually in aggregate. The other, proposed by Common Cause Rhode Island, would broaden the definition of “interested person” to explicitly cover lobbyists and their employers, filling a gap that lets public officials and employees accept potentially unlimited freebies from these parties.
Tuesday’s meeting agenda explains that while the so-called gift rule “has historically been understood to include gifts from lobbyists to the public officials they lobby, lobbyists for not-for-profit entities may not fit neatly into this definition.”
Common Cause Rhode Island first petitioned for a rule change late last December. In May, the commission voted to start the rulemaking process. 
“There is not, as we sit here right now, a predilection to either side,” Jones said. “That has not been discussed by our commission at all.”
Part of the process involves public feedback, which Jones entertained to the fullest extent. At the start of the meeting, the commission’s executive director, Jason Gramitt, suggested the chair might impose a time limit on commentary, but Jones avoided any explicit restraints and asked people to simply be “aware” and “respectful” of the time they used for comment. 
The commission also OK’d moving public comment ahead of the day’s executive session, so that people could contribute sooner. Across roughly a half-hour, six people — including the current and former heads of Common Cause Rhode Island — spoke up to support the lobbyist rule change and reject the gift increase.
Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion took to the podium first. “Why would someone hire a lobbyist if they didn’t have an interest in the outcome of a government decision?” he asked. 
As for the gift increase, Marion argued the desire for more expensive tokens of appreciation derives from a small group of lawmakers. One of those lawmakers is Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III, who submitted a bill this past legislative session that would have upped the gift limit to $50. During the bill’s committee hearing on April 8, Ciccone pooh-poohed the $25 limit — codified in 2005 —  as inadequate given inflation. 
“There is no public demand for this change, just the demand of a handful of legislators who can use their campaign accounts, or their legislative salaries, to buy all the lunches they want,” Marion said.
North Kingstown resident Kathleen Odean thought the existing $25 cap is sufficient. In her years as public librarian in California, “No one gave me any gifts,” Odean said. “And I did my job as well as I could.”
Gramitt said the commission will continue to accept written public comment on the possible changes through Sept. 16, before the panel takes up the issue again at a subsequent meeting. The next two meetings are on Sept. 30 and Oct. 8.
“We’re hopeful that at their next meeting, they’re going to change the gift rule and close the loophole,” Marion said after the meeting. Possible revisions to ethics law could help people “shed the belief” that the Ocean State “has a corruption problem,” he added.
There are also practical benefits to the change. “Public officials should have clarity of what the law says, and that law should say if a person has a lobbyist badge on, they shouldn’t be able to give you a gift more than $25,” Marion said.

‘Three minutes’ for you but not for me
Speaking after Marion was his predecessor H. Philip West Jr., who led Common Cause Rhode Island for 18 years before retiring in 2005. Although he noted he was not speaking on behalf of Common Cause, West offered a systemic critique of the lobbying loophole. 
“It’s very difficult for legislators to tell who is an interested person,” West said. “In fact, it’s almost impossible.”
The categorical exclusion of lobbyists from the state’s present idea of “interested persons” is thoroughly undermined, West thought, by the realities of policymaking. Most small advocacy groups and ordinary citizens get maybe “three minutes” when they testify on bills at the State House, West said. 
But the same is not true for former legislators who take up lobbying after they leave the General Assembly. West shared with the commission a document detailing his admittedly non-comprehensive analysis of former lawmakers who now get paid to lobby. Using public records, West accounted for about $3.5 million paid in the 2025 legislative session to 14 lawmakers-turned-lobbyists, from dozens of clients including Bristol Myers Squibb, Care New England, Brown University Health and Haxton’s Liquors.
While West’s calculations are conservative and not definitive — they exclude hourly work, and assume firms paid the listed lobbyists in six monthly installments — the 14 individuals listed in West’s research seem to represent a massive amount of lobbying muscle. Among the active lobbyists in 2025 who used to be members of the General Assembly are a former House speaker, Senate president and Providence mayor.
“Here’s the important point: They largely conceal what they are lobbying for, from the press and from the public,” West said.
Jones asked West if he was talking about campaign contributions made by lobbyists, which were included in West’s documentation but are firmly outside the commission’s purview. West replied that’s not the case, asserting his main target is the “completely independent” fact of policy discussions behind closed doors — or, just as often, out in the open, at soccer or baseball games or private lunches.










There is no public demand for this change, just the demand of a handful of legislators who can use their campaign accounts, or their legislative salaries, to buy all the lunches they want.


– Common Cause Rhode Island Executive DirectorJohn Marion, urging Ethics Commission to reject a proposed increase on gift limits


“These lobbyists, for the most part, are not saying to legislators publicly, in public hearings, ‘Here’s what I want you to do.’ They’re doing that in private.”
West reappeared — in book form — during Kate McGovern’s testimony, when the Providence resident held up a copy of West’s 2014 tome, “Scandals and Secrets: Reforming Rhode Island, 1986-2006.” McGovern described a legislative process in her former residence of New Hampshire as one in which all bills get a hearing and committee vote. 
But in Rhode Island, legislation can face a Sisyphean struggle, with some bills returning year after year after year, only to die multiple deaths while waiting to be heard in committee. 
“We got here, and it’s like, ‘What do you mean there hasn’t been a vote on payday lending in a dozen years?’” McGovern recounted, referencing a piece of legislation that failed to pass for years and only after the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio last April.
“The outcome of the lobbying is extremely relevant to what happens at the State House,” McGovern said, noting that whether bills pass committee is not always left up to the committee chairs themselves.
Jessie Kingston, also a Providence resident, told the commission it needs to adopt gift limits amid what she described as a broader context of federal opacity.  
Said Kingston, “If not now, then when?”

Battin federal courthouse in Billings, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan). President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. Attorney for Montana is one of 10 federal prosecutor nominees whose confirmations were delayed last week when a Democratic senator objected.
Kurt Alme has served in the position in an interim role since Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him in March. Alme previously served as chief federal law enforcement official in Montana during President Donald Trump’s first term, from 2017 until 2020, after being recommended by Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. His first nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.
But twice in the last week during Senate proceedings, Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has requested unanimous consent to confirm 10 U.S. Attorney nominees by voice vote, which would bypass the requirement for roll-call votes.
Ranking committee member Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, objected to Grassley’s request last week, citing a precedent set by then-Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, during the Biden administration, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, objected on Monday.
Vance put a limited hold on a limited number of U.S. attorney nominees. Vance further announced in 2023  he intended to place a blanket hold on all Justice Department nominees to “grind it to a halt,” Durbin said in a statement on the Senate floor. As a result, only 68 of Biden’s 76 U.S. attorney nominees made it through the confirmation process.
“I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that you did not agree with Senator Vance’s actions back then, and I don’t believe you do now, but we can’t have one set of rules for Republican presidents and another for Democratic presidents,” Durbin said.
Grassley responded with remarks on the floor asking Democrats to “relent form their partisan obstruction.”
“Debate and disagreement about policy is to be expected, but it should never come at the expense of public safety,” Grassley said.
A statement from Grassley’s office said the move “forces the Senate to burn valuable hours of floor time” to process the nominations, rather than using the expedited voice vote procedure, and added that 94% of President Biden’s U.S. Attorney nominations were approved by voice vote.
So far during Trump’s second term, only two U.S. Attorney’s have been confirmed by the Senate — Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia, and Jason Reding Quiñones for the South District of Florida — both by roll call vote. Durbin similarly blocked a voice vote on Quiñones’ nominations as well.
In a TV appearance Daines said blocking the nominees was an “unprecedented move.”
“We’ve got to to actually change the rules,” Daines said. “We’re working on that as Republicans so that we can go back to where we used to be, and that was getting these nominees like U.S. attorneys and other sub-cabinet level appointees through the U.S. Senate in a timely fashion.”
In a post on social media Tuesday, Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy said the “historic obstruction is making Montanans less safe.”
In months Alme has served in an interim capacity, he has overseen dozens of criminal and civil cases.
After his first stint as U.S. Attorney, Alme worked for Gov. Greg Gianforte as state budget director at the start of the Republican’s first gubernatorial term. He left the position less than a year later, citing the strain of commuting to Helena from his home in Billings.
Most recently, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Alme served as Executive Vice President for Planned Giving with the National Christian Foundation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/James-F.-Battin-Courthouse-Billings-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 15:57:13.927538

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers approved a bill to reauthorize the federal Grain Standards Act, with key updates aimed at modernizing the grain inspection and grading process. 
The bill was passed via a voice vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday evening. Lawmakers said passing the bill ensures the U.S. grain market, and specifically its ability to export grain overseas, can continue operating at the “gold standard.” 
The U.S. Grain Standards Act, first authorized in 1916, gives the federal government the authority to establish marketing standards and procedures for inspection and weighting grains and oilseeds.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson said the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025 plays a “vital role” in the agricultural system, and noted the law ensures “safety, quality and a standard of excellence for the American grain industry.”
The bill reauthorizes the standards in the act that are set to expire at the end of September. 
“If we want America to maintain its status as the safest, most abundant grain supply in the world, reauthorization of this act … is absolutely essential,” Thompson said on the House floor Monday. 
The Pennsylvania Republican, who sponsored the bill, said the grain standards act makes sure farmers get a fair price on their grain, which includes crops like corn, sorghum, wheat, barley and soybeans. Similarly, he said, the standards enforced by the act help foreign buyers feel confident in the quality of American commodities.
In addition to extending the standards through fiscal year 2030, the bill directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to “prioritize the adoption of improved grain grading technology.” 
Grain grading is the process to evaluate the quality of grain, based on specific criteria, which also determines its price. 
Neither Thompson nor the bill detailed what these technology improvements might be, but the bill gives USDA the authority and flexibility to invest in technological upgrades for the process. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the bill, the reauthorization would allocate $23 million annually over the 2026-2030 period to cover the cost of these technological upgrades, as well as the typical procedures of the bill. 
The 2020 reauthorization of the bill also authorized a $23 million annual budget. 
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas, also spoke in favor of the bill Monday and said its calls for technological improvements would create an opportunity to “make the process more accurate, efficient and consistent.” 
“Foreign grain buyers should be confident in the process we have in place to ensure that our experts are adequately inspected,” Davids said. “The bipartisan U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025 is critical for the global grain trade.” 
House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, said in a July 22 hearing on the bill that farmers’ work always has uncertainty, but noted that uncertainty was heightened with the ongoing tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump. 
Craig said the updates to the bill will help USDA focus on modernization, which will keep the U.S. as the “gold standard” in grain inspection and in turn support the sale of grain to foreign countries. 
“The bill’s entire intention is to help ensure grain can get from our farms and grain elevators, onto ships bound for overseas markets,” Craig said. 
The 2025 bill additionally changes the fund to a trust fund, which the CBO analysis said would not be “substantively different” from the current fund and therefore would “not have a budgetary effect.”
Grain Inspection Advisory Committee members would also be allowed to serve until a new member is appointed, under the new bill. Currently, committee members serve staggered, three-year terms. 
Thompson closed his comments by noting that a lapse in authorization of the bill, which expires at the end of the month, would disrupt the grain market and cost the farm economy “more than $70 million a day.” 
The National Grain and Feed Association celebrated the progress of the bill in a press release and the group’s President and CEO Mike Seyfert called it a “must pass bill.”
“This bill strengthens the reliability and competitiveness of U.S. grain by promoting modernization and minimizing red tape,” Seyfert said. “We now urge the Senate to act swiftly so this important legislation can be sent to President Trump for signature.”

“Indiana isn’t a playground for electoral shenanigans, and we won’t let Washington outsiders tell us how to run our state,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters. “Hoosiers play fair.

 It’s unclear if there’s any overlap with an earlier petition that had more than 4,000 signatures submitted last month, though both voting rights coalitions featured Common Cause Indiana. 
Traditionally, redistricting occurs following the once-a-decade census — with the latest maps dating back to 2021. President Donald Trump, seeking to grow the historically slim Republican majority in the U.S. House, has pressured Republican states to pursue redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Trump has personally appealed to both Republican caucus leaders in recent weeks — as has Vice President JD Vance. Gov. Mike Braun has said he’ll wait to hear from legislative leadership about early redistricting before calling a special session.
Such an effort will not be as transparent as 2021’s map-drawing session, which featured several public forums in each of the nine congressional districts and didn’t have any legal challenges. An August poll of 1,662 Hoosiers found that the majority, or 52%, opposed any early redistricting. Of those, 43% were “very opposed.”

A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that the Mid Vermont Christian School must be allowed to participate in state athletics, two years after being banned for forfeiting against a team with a transgender player. The court returned the case to district court for further proceedings.
The ruling comes after several years of litigation by the pre-K-12 private Christian school in Quechee. The Vermont Principals’ Association barred the school from participating in state athletics after the school forfeited a girls’ playoff basketball game in February 2023 to avoid playing the Long Trail School, which had a transgender player on the team.
School officials at the time said they were concerned that playing against “a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of the players,” and its head of school, Vicky Fogg, told Valley News that allowing “biological males to participate in women’s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women’s sports in general.”

The Vermont Principals’ Association governs rules around school sports in Vermont, and said at the time that Mid Vermont Christian violated its anti-discrimination and gender identity policies.
The school, along with several parents and students, sued in federal court in 2023, seeking reinstatement of the school’s membership to the Vermont Principals’ Association.
According to Tuesday’s court ruling, Mid Vermont Christian School argued that “forcing girls to compete against the biological males would affirm that those males are females,” in violation of their religious beliefs.
U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford in June 2024 denied the school’s request to be readmitted to the principals’ association.
But on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed that decision and agreed with the school’s claims, writing that they were “likely to succeed” in showing that the association’s exclusion of the school “was not neutral because it displayed hostility toward the school’s religious beliefs.”
Judge Michael H. Park, writing for the court, wrote that the principals’ association “publicly castigated Mid Vermont — and religious schools generally — while the VPA rushed to judgment on whether and how to discipline the school.” Park said that the punishment they imposed on the school “was unprecedented, overbroad, and procedurally irregular.”
The court sent the case back to the federal district court for further proceedings.
Jay Nichols said Tuesday the Vermont Principals’ Association, its officers and employees “do not harbor any hostility towards religious viewpoints,” but declined to comment further, citing pending litigation.
A spokesperson for the state’s Agency of Education declined to comment, also citing pending litigation.
The school was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a preeminent conservative Christian legal group that has had a growing presence in Vermont education and politics.
The group, in a press release, called the ruling a “victory for religious schools.”
David Cortman, senior counsel and vice president of U.S. litigation for the group, said in the press release that the appeals court was “right to uphold constitutional protections by guaranteeing the school can fully participate while still adhering to its religious beliefs.”
Chris Goodwin, the Mid Vermont Christian School girls’ basketball coach, said in the press release that the school strives “to exemplify biblical truth in and through everything we do.”
“We’re grateful for our legal team at Alliance Defending Freedom who helped us get back in the game,” he said.

“When drug companies give discounts and rebates for medications, CVS Caremark was supposed to pass that money on to HealthChoice,” according to a news release from Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office. “Instead, the state contends that CVS kept millions of dollars that should have gone to help lower healthcare costs for state employees from January 2020 through December 2024.”
CVS Caremark is set to pay Oklahoma $32.1 million under the terms of the settlement. About $27 million of this goes to HealthChoice once lawyer fees to pay for outside counsel are deducted, according to a news release. 
Under the settlement terms, CVS Caremark will also report any collected rebates every quarter to ensure “greater transparency and accountability,” according to the release. 
“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” Drummond said in a statement. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.” 
Drummond said his office is continuing to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly under reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies for acquiring prescription drugs. In January he estimated could recover around $2 million in fees and restitution.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-09 19:08:18+00:00,CT Mirror,"One year in, CT correction ombuds has nearly 400 complaints and no staff",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/09/correction-ombuds-staff-hiring/,DeVaughn Ward told Correction Advisory Committee hiring was delayed after CT legislature doubled his budget and he shifted his staffing plans.,"A year after his appointment as ombuds for the Department of Correction, DeVaughn Ward has a backlog of 388 complaints and no staff to help address them. 
Ward said during a meeting of the Correction Advisory Committee last Thursday that he was heartbroken he’s been unable to respond to many of the incarcerated people who reach out to him. 
“It’s a horrible feeling. Every single day I hear some type of atrocity that’s going on in a facility, and I don’t have the tools or the staff to be able to deal with it,” Ward said. 
Ward told the Connecticut Mirror he’s been asking the state’s Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Policy and Management, the agencies responsible for hiring and for the state’s budget, to hire staff for the office since last November. 
Initially, there was only enough money to hire two people. The Office of Policy and Management had approved those positions, an agency spokesperson said. 
But hiring plans changed in June when the legislature voted to increase the budget of the ombuds office from $400,000 annually to $800,000. The additional funding allowed for a total of five positions — an administrative assistant, a clerk typist, an associate ombuds, an assistant ombuds focused on investigations and a nurse consultant. At Ward’s request, hiring for the two original positions was discontinued in favor of the new positions.
Ward said that two of those positions, the administrative assistant and the clerk typist, have since been posted on the state’s employment website and the postings closed last week. He said he hopes the positions will be filled by October, so the office can begin to address the backlog in complaints.  
Ward said not being able to answer complaints jeopardizes his relationship with the people he serves. “The confidence in the office amongst the incarcerated community is just being eroded. And that’s very unfortunate,” he said. 
The lack of a nurse consultant poses a particular problem, Ward said, since he is required to submit a report to state lawmakers by Dec. 1 on the quality of healthcare in the correctional facilities. Without that position, Ward said he did not believe it would be possible for him to meet that deadline. 
Chris Collibee, spokesman for the Office of Policy and Management, said the nurse consultant position required the creation of a new job class, which the administration is currently working with labor relations to create. 
“The administration remains committed to ensuring this office has positions that the legislature has approved and that all state labor agreements are followed for job classifications,” said Collibee, who noted he was also speaking for the Department of Administrative Services and the governor’s office. 
Collibee said the assistant ombuds position had been approved by the office. He underscored that his agency must follow the state’s established hiring process in recruiting for the positions. 
The Department of Administrative Services, which oversees hiring, did not respond to more detailed questions. 
During their meeting with Ward Thursday, members of the Correction Advisory Committee also expressed frustration and confusion about the delays in hiring. 
“It’s very hard for me, personally, to understand why, after a year, there is no progress here,” said Tadhg Dooley, the co-chair of the committee and an attorney with Wiggin and Dana LLP.
Dooley’s fellow co-chair, Marisol Garcia, told CT Mirror she thought the delay was “ridiculous” and that it was indicative of the state’s priorities around criminal justice. 
“This office has had struggles since its inception for support,” she said. (Garcia is also a member of CT Mirror’s Board of Directors.)
In a call with CT Mirror, Ward called the bureaucratic delays “death by a thousand cuts” for his office. He expressed frustration that DOC had been able to hire a number of correctional officers, but he was unable to hire a single position in his office. 
According to Andrius Banevicius, a spokesperson for the Department of Correction, the department has hired 155 correctional officers since July 1.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1109_SR_CheshirePrison_008-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 15:57:13.927538

(Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)KOTZEBUE, ALASKA — Have you ever had a bad day outside, and just wanted to stop?
As an enthusiastic skier, biker and runner, I’ve struggled through my fair share of races when I wasn’t at my best. But I’d never given in to the impulse until a late summer day a few weeks ago.
As a participant in a half marathon in this Northwest Alaska hub town — a race I’d signed up for 36 hours before the start — I’d run about eight miles and had five to go. My legs hurt, and the carpet of tundra just off the road looked soft and inviting.
Welcome to the Cape Blossom Marathon and Half — the northernmost organized marathon in America, and, so far as I know, the only one where nobody will judge you if you take a break during the middle of the race to sit in the moss and shove sun-warmed blueberries into your mouth.
As a matter of transparency: My friend Hannah Atkinson is the race organizer. She is not paying me to hype up the Cape Blossom Marathon. But the time I spent 30 miles above the Arctic Circle last month was sufficiently joyous to justify some free advertising and a bit of rural Alaska travel writing in Northern Journal.
The City of Kotzebue, which sponsors the event, is already planning the second official edition next year, on Aug. 29. Here are some of the reasons you should go.
1. Unlike running races on the road system, where you might have to train religiously to vie for a top result, you are practically guaranteed an age-group podium at the Cape Blossom race. Just 12 people finished this year’s half marathon, and only five finished the full marathon. Everyone got a sweet finisher’s medal, and a certificate signed by the city mayor.

2. Boats! Marathon competitors took a 10-mile ride across Kotzebue Sound, south from downtown to Cape Blossom, where one day the city plans to build a deepwater port. From the beach at Cape Blossom, the course led back to town — but not without more boats! To get past a creek between Cape Blossom and Kotzebue, runners had to climb into a communal kayak and, with volunteers, paddle themselves across.
3. Other pre-marathon pasta feeds might feature dubiously sourced meat sauce. At the Cape Blossom Marathon, community members cooked up noodles not just with ground caribou, but also with ground moose. Other dinner options: fresh-caught trout and chum salmon, including one filet garnished with the classic combination of cheese, onion and mayonnaise. (If you’re still only cooking your salmon with lemon and dill, it’s time to branch out.)

4. The whole community, including the runners, pitches in and supports the event. The night before the race, Hannah enlisted me in organizing snacks for the aid stations; meanwhile, city workers stayed late after dinner at the Kotzebue Boys and Girls Club to fill water jugs. During the race, every runner I passed gave me a high-five.

5. As they say in the Northwest Arctic, Aug. 24 is always a good day. Okay, actually, they don’t say that, and I think the weather in Kotzebue in late August has the potential to be prettttty cold and unpleasant. Hannah asked us to bring a fur hat and mittens that she accidentally had left in Anchorage. But on this particular Aug. 24, the sun came out, and the half marathon took me, plus some old and new friends, down a glorious stretch of beach along the sound, then up to the bluffs and on to a road through the tundra. In other words, the weather and scenery in Kotzebue can be sweet in the late summer, and it’s worth rolling the dice because sometimes you might win.

After an awards ceremony back at the Boys and Girls Club, we capped off the day with an official race barbecue on the beach, roasting Costco hot dogs over a pile of burning pallets. Some of us swam. Twice. There were sled dog puppies. New friends exchanged phone numbers and emails. Late-night pizza, kimchi and keepsakes were procured from Uutuku, one of Kotzebue’s incredible convenience stores.
Everyone needs a souvenir from Uutuku. (Northern Journal)
Moral of the story: Getting off the road system is almost always worthwhile. Buy more last-minute mileage tickets for weekend visits to rural hubs. And sign up for next year’s Cape Blossom Marathon. There’s an email list where you can register for updates.
And no, I won’t leave you with a cliffhanger: I did, in fact, begrudgingly get up from my comfortable perch on the tundra and finish the race. I plan to go back next year — and I may or may not be better prepared.

Thirty prominent professional health organizations signed an open letter urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The rollout of updated COVID-19 vaccines has left many North Carolinians puzzled over whether they qualify for the new booster shots.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the new Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax shots for all seniors at the end of August. But for younger Americans, there are restrictions — at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity, according to the Associated Press.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. told a Senate committee during a hearing last week that access to the new shots “depends on the states.”
In North Carolina, the state Department of Health and Human Services is “closely monitoring” changes in federal guidelines, spokesperson Summer Tonizzo told NC Newsline.
“We are actively exploring options to improve vaccine availability and ensure that all North Carolinians have convenient access to vaccinations throughout the state,” Tonizzo said in a statement.
Following state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina can administer those vaccines recommended by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , but ACIP has yet to give their recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season.
“Without ACIP recommendations, COVID vaccines may only be available from a pharmacist in North Carolina for those ages 18 and up with a prescription,” Tonizzo clarified.
That leaves many North Carolina pharmacists and medical providers anxiously waiting for the outcome of ACIP’s meeting Sept. 18 and 19.  At least five states have decided not to wait on that guidance and are making the shots widely available now.
At the moment, CVS MinuteClinic is offering the updated shots to patients in North Carolina if they present an authorized prescription, a spokesperson from the company told NC Newsline. Prescriptions are not required in neighboring South Carolina and Tennessee due to different state pharmacy laws.
COVID-19 vaccines are available at Walgreens in the state for eligible patients with a valid prescription, a spokesperson told NC Newsline.
Patients can review their vaccine eligibility and schedule appointments at CVS or Walgreens by speaking with their local pharmacists or checking online.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/COVID-shot-Getty-2025.jpg,,,2025-09-09 15:57:13.927538

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After their pursuit of taxpayer school funding failed to get approval from the U.S. Supreme Court, Oklahoma Catholic leaders have canceled plans to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School and will open a private online academy instead.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa announced Monday the opening of St. Carlo Acutis Classical Academy in the 2026-27 school year. Named for a recently canonized millennial saint, the tuition-based virtual school will enroll up to 300 students statewide in kindergarten through eighth grade before adding a freshman class the following year.
Meanwhile, the website for St. Isidore of Seville virtual school, named for the patron saint of the internet, is no longer reachable. Archdiocese of Oklahoma City spokesperson John Helsley confirmed that plans to open St. Isidore have been discontinued.
A member of St. Isidore’s Board of Directors, Brett Farley, also verified the school will no longer open.
Catholic leaders will not seek state dollars for St. Carlo Acutis Classical Academy beyond a tax credit that assists private school students with tuition and fees, Farley and Helsley said.

The academy’s website shows St. Carlo Acutis will have the same governing board members who sat on St. Isidore’s Board of Directors, including Farley and other archdiocese officials.
The new school also will fulfill a primary goal intended for St. Isidore, which was to make Catholic schooling available to students in all parts of the state.
Many rural areas have no parish school, said Misty Smith, the academy’s head of school. 
“One of the things we established through St. Isidore was that there’s (a) definite need to reach every corner of our state for good quality Catholic education,” Smith said. “And so, Carlo Acutis was one of the things that we decided we need to go with this. We need to actually provide this to the Catholic families and to really anybody who’s interested in it.”
Smith said the new academy will be a “better and different experience” than what students might have had at St. Isidore. Unlike the original virtual school concept, St. Carlo Acutis will have a classical school curriculum — a method of education often focusing on liberal arts, classic literature, and philosophy or theology.
Teachers will give live instruction online, and students will have opportunities for hands-on learning, Smith said. The school’s focus “will be nurturing the Christian development of each student” and providing guidelines for academic excellence within the context of the Catholic faith, the archdiocese has said.
The academy is already accredited, so families will be able to apply for Oklahoma’s parental choice tax credit right away, Smith said. Enrollment is expected to begin this winter.

The fight to open St. Isidore of Seville as the nation’s first religious charter school started in 2023 with an application to the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board. Later that year, the board approved the school’s opening in a 3-2 vote that made national headlines. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, contending the concept of a government-funded religious school “eviscerates” the constitutional separation of church and state. The state Supreme Court agreed with Drummond and blocked the school from opening.
Catholic leaders and the Statewide Charter School Board, which has since dropped the word “virtual” from its name, then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. They contended charter schools are actually private entities contracted with the state and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case on April 30. The justices ultimately deadlocked at 4-4, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. 
That allowed the Oklahoma Supreme Court decision against the school to stand.
The new virtual academy will bear the name of the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, who was born in 1991 in London and raised in Italy. Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis on Sunday.
Acutis died in 2006 at age 15 from leukemia. Tulsa Bishop David Konderla said Acutis created a website documenting Eucharistic miracles that “inspired and educated people around the world.” 
“His life exemplified humility, piety, devotion, and discipline,” Konderla said in the school’s announcement. “His faith-filled life continues to inspire young people everywhere.”

Article Summary

Former State Sen. Darren Bailey will announce a second campaign for governor, according to sources close to Bailey.
Cook County Republican Party Chair Aaron Del Mar will be Bailey’s running mate, according to a source.
Bailey lost the 2022 election to Gov. JB Pritzker by 13 points after a strong showing in the Republican primary. He later lost a race to unseat incumbent Republican Congressman Mike Bost.
Bailey would likely be the fourth person to announce plans to challenge Pritzker this year.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Darren Bailey plans to run for governor for a second time in 2026, Capitol News Illinois confirmed with sources close to the campaign.
The former state senator and farmer from Clay County would become the highest-profile Republican to enter the race, having lost the 2022 campaign against Gov. JB Pritzker and a close primary race in 2024 against U.S. Rep. Mike Bost for a downstate congressional seat.
A formal announcement is expected next week. News of the planned announcement was first reported by NBC Chicago on Monday afternoon.
Bailey rose to statewide notoriety in 2020 as a state lawmaker who opposed mask mandates and other COVID-19 emergency actions early in the pandemic. He capitalized on his opposition to the Pritzker-imposed restrictions and ran for governor in 2022.
Bailey easily won the Republican primary that year with 57% of the vote. His campaign was indirectly helped by Pritzker, who ran TV ads during the primary calling Bailey “too conservative” for Illinois, which helped to boost his credentials with Republican voters.
But Pritzker handily won a second term with 55% of the vote, defeating Bailey by 13 points in a race that the Associated Press called for Pritzker just moments after the polls closed. Pritzker dumped millions of dollars into his campaign as Bailey struggled to compete despite receiving some financial help from Lake Forest billionaire Dick Uihlein.
Bailey then tried to unseat Bost in 2024 in the 12th Congressional District but came up about 2,700 votes short. While he received President Donald Trump’s endorsement in the governor’s race, Trump endorsed Bost over Bailey in 2024.
New running mate
Bailey plans to enlist Cook County Republican Party Chair Aaron Del Mar as his running mate, a source said.
Del Mar ran for lieutenant governor in 2022 alongside Gary Rabine, receiving 6.5% of the vote.


Aaron Del Mar, chair of the Cook County Republican Party, is pictured at the Republican State Central Committee’s August meeting. He will be the running mate for former state Sen. Darren Bailey as he tries to run again for governor, sources told Capitol News Illinois.

Del Mar was elected to lead the Cook County Republican Party earlier this year, marking the second time he has held that role after previously leading the party in the early 2010s. He is also a member of the Illinois GOP’s State Central Committee and is Palatine Township’s highway commissioner.
Outside of politics, Del Mar has led a career in business and as an entrepreneur.
Bailey ran in 2022 with Stephanie Trussell, a conservative radio host from the west suburbs.
Bailey’s message
It’s unclear how Bailey plans to overcome his 2022 loss and what message he will take to voters in 2026.
He focused much of his 2022 campaign on crime and public safety, criticizing the SAFE-T Act and bashing Chicago as a “hellhole.”

The message failed to gain traction with voters, however, as Democrats focused heavily on abortion rights in the months after Roe v. Wade was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Facebook has been Bailey’s primary communication platform to voters, and in recent weeks, he has focused many of his posts on Pritzker and various ways he believes the governor has failed Illinois. Like other Republicans, Bailey has criticized Pritzker’s growing national profile.
“In 2026, we have the chance to stop him,” Bailey wrote in a post Monday. “But it will take ALL of us. Every Illinoisan who knows we deserve better. Together, we can end JB’s presidential ambitions before they even begin and finally turn Illinois around.”

Bailey would become at least the fourth candidate to enter the Republican primary for governor, which has been slowing taking shape this fall. DuPage County Sheriff Jim Mendrick, Lake Forest resident Joe Severino, and conservative media writer Ted Dabrowski have also formed committees to run for governor.
Antioch Mayor Scott Gartner released a statement Sunday saying he was also considering running for governor as a Republican.
Pritzker is running for a rare third term as governor amid speculation he will also run for president in 2028. Candidates must turn their petitions in to the State Board of Elections by the end of October.

One member of the task force, Stacey Patrick, has been a resident of the south Jackson complex for nearly 17 years. JXN Water, the city’s privately run water utility, discontinued services to Blossom Apartments in late July after its owner had long failed to pay the bill.
“When they fall short, we are still hurt,” Patrick said during the meeting. “We are the ones that are still hurt. Is there anything they could put in place that it wouldn’t affect us?”
In addition to living without water, Patrick said she and her husband, Robert, have been working daily for the last month on applications for apartments around Jackson. The search has been difficult, she said, because many places require security deposits and proof of salary up to three times the amount of the rent. 
“It’s very hard. It’s not easy,” Patrick said. “It’s not like it used to be where there’s a sign, you call them and you can get into a place. I’ve never seen it like this before.”
Patrick hoped they had finally gotten a break with Arbor Park Apartments, but after paying nearly $1,600 to claim a unit, once it was time to move in, it was uninhabitable, trashed and filthy.
“She (the property manager) had us believing that we were supposedly getting into a place for a whole month,” she told Mississippi Today. “She kept us on hold. We could have been out there trying to find other housing.”
Patrick is now waiting for a refund from the apartments.

After JXN Water initially shut off services to Blossom Apartments in July, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate twice ordered the water temporarily restored. But those extensions have run out, and since then, Patrick said the Jackson Fire Department has ceased delivering water to residents. Mississippi Home Corporation deemed the property unfit for housing in early August. In addition to Patrick, roughly a dozen families are still living at the complex without water as they struggle to find a new place. 
“ It’s just a hard thing that we’re going through right now because of this water shut off, and it’s not easy going out here trying to find a place. It’s not easy at all,” Patrick said. 
Since mid-August, Stewpot Community Services has been working to relocate Blossom residents. The nonprofit has placed a few residents in hotels, while others are waiting it out with family members. Jill Buckley, director of Stewpot, said that of the 27 households it has identified through management records and door-knocking, they’ve been able to rehouse eight families.
“One thing that has really slowed the process down is the HUD inspections for people who have housing vouchers, so waiting for the inspections to happen has been a little frustrating,” Buckley said.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires rental property inspections to ensure their habitability and safety. Buckley said another issue residents are facing is the availability of apartments across Jackson. 
Eight of the 11-member Housing Task Force were in attendance at Monday’s meeting. Attorney Robert Ireland, who is representing another complex in its lawsuit with JXN Water over nonpayment, resigned from the task force to avoid a conflict of interest, said Nic Lott, Jackson’s communications director.
Task force vice-chair Jennifer Welch, who owns and manages properties in Jackson, Hattiesburg and Meridian, described one issue impacting JXN Water as “churn.” Limited liability companies rack up large water bills, terminate the account and then establish a new LLC to open a new account with JXN Water. 
“The property doesn’t even change ownership,” Welch said. “It’s just new LLCs being established really for this purpose of fraud, in my opinion.”
Welch said initiating a multifamily account with JXN Water should be as rigorous as applying for a loan. Landlords should be required to have a deed, be in good standing with the Secretary of State’s office and provide personal information and a working contact number or email for the manager of the LLC, she said.
“ There’s a lot of times when I sign up for a random account and they’re verifying that my phone number is legit,” Welch said. “Can we not do that if someone’s gonna be able to have a $150,000 water bill?”
Carla Dazet, a billing executive for JXN Water, also attended the meeting, though not as the company’s official designee to the task force. She said JXN Water has now implemented a process for shut-offs – whether it’s a residential, commercial or multi-family account, once the account is past-due 60 days, the property will lose water.  
“It won’t be a compounded annual delinquency. It’ll just be two months,” Dazet said. “That’s going forward. That’s already in place, so we don’t have to worry about the big bills building up.”
Welch also noted that as a property manager, she has found it increasingly difficult to purchase insurance for her properties due to the perception of high crime in the city.
“If we can prove that those areas are changing, I think that it can make it easier for people like myself to get insurance,” Welch said. 
Task force members also discussed city ordinances and code enforcement. Earnest Ward, president of the Association of South Jackson Neighborhoods, said he performs routine inspections on his properties, something that other landlords are lax to do. 
Units get damaged, cars rust away in yards, and some tenants have multiple pets that are destructive to the property which further decreases the value, he said. A solution he proposed is including city ordinances around rental inspections in the lease agreement. 
“I think it needs to be done regularly. They know what they expect,” Ward said. “Certain things they probably won’t do, but I think the landlord needs to take more of their responsibility on inspecting their own property.”
In 2022, the city made changes to its rental registration ordinance in an effort to track compliance and tackle blight. According to figures shared during the meeting, the goal was to inspect nearly 11,000 units, but the city fell short by inspecting only 3,200.
The city also relaunched the rental registry and inspection program, which requires  landlords to register properties and provides an avenue for tenants to record complaints. Victoria Love, the rental registry manager, said there are currently about 50 open cases, and most cases are closed within 30 days, though some have been open for up to 90 days. 
“Where you do have a slight issue is on some of your smaller landlords,” Love said. “A lot of times, they just don’t have additional capital to repair things completely.”
Welch said the information in the registry could be outdated and that the task force should consider recommending that the city conduct annual updates.
“Operators are changing, property managers are changing, things happen,” Welch said. “I think that the city needs to be putting effort into updating the information that’s registered.”

Private equity is a broad term referring to investments in private companies — i.e. those that are not publicly traded on the stock market. It’s often the venue of the wealthiest investors like pension funds, university endowments and the most affluent families and has drawn scrutiny for extracting value from companies by loading them up with debt or cutting their quality. 
Seventeen percent of the state’s $146 billion pension fund dollars are invested in private equity, according to the State Board of Investment’s most recent report. Minnesota was among the first states to invest its pension funds significantly in private equity, and the State Board of Investment does a good job of negotiating with private equity fund managers to strike deals and negotiate lower fees, according to a report released Monday by Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, a think tank on tax and fiscal policy issues.  
But the same report goes on to say the promise of private equity’s higher returns comes with some downsides, including less transparency, higher fees and significant risk. 
A spokesperson for the State Board of Investment said the board has not yet reviewed the report, and pointed to the pension funds’ strong performance — returns of more than 10% annually over the past five years.
Minnesota’s investments have come under scrutiny recently; Ryan Leitner of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project wrote a Reformer guest commentary criticizing the board’s consideration of an investment in a firm that owns an Ohio coal power plant. Some pro-Palestine protestors have called on the State Board of Investment to divest from Israel by selling off its investments in Israeli bonds and companies linked to the war in Gaza. 
Private equity funds compete with each other for investments, and so are incentivized to keep some details of their operation private. The State Board of Investment, on the other hand, has to abide by the transparency requirements that come with the management of taxpayer money. An increase in transparency by the state could mean the firms no longer want to do business with Minnesota pension funds.
The State Board of Investment recently started disclosing the total amount in private market management fees paid, but doesn’t report those fees on a per-fund basis.
“It’s also not unreasonable to assume that SBI is also concerned that making unfamiliar data and details available to the public can generate the opposite of transparency and understanding — a fertile environment for misinterpretation, confusion, misuse, and erroneous conclusions,” the report reads.
The report concludes with a recommendation that the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement hold public hearings on the topic of transparency in private equity investments.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/investments.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 14:57:52.858933

House Republicans announced last week that they were forming a select subcommittee to investigate the attack and potentially the previous-run Jan. 6 Committee. That panel — which included seven Democrats and two Republicans — produced an 845-page report in December 2022 after an 18-month investigation. It concluded that President Donald Trump was the “central cause” of the riots.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced on Monday that Moskowitz would participate.
“In their continued campaign of distraction, my esteemed colleagues across the aisle have found a new target: the events of January 6. But make no mistake: we will not let their efforts rewrite the dark day that it was,” Moskowitz said in a written statement.
“I look forward to serving on this committee that can only be described as a giant waste of time and taxpayer dollars, and I hope that one day soon we can get back to answering the American people’s call to lower costs and solve problems.”
The other Democrats on the committee are California’s Eric Swallwell and Texas’ Jasmine Crockett. Maryland’s Jamie Raskin, as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, will serve as an ex officio member.
In his statement, Jeffries said Republicans were “trying to rewrite history and corrupt our electoral system” with the new committee and vowed that “House Democrats will continue to forcefully and aggressively fight back.”

(Photo by Ned Olive/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Tuesday that his office is looking into whether several insulin manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers artificially inflated costs of diabetic medications. 
Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. They retain rebates and discounts from contracts, but some consumers and pharmacies have said they are unsure how much savings are being passed on. In the cases that Miyares’ office is investigating, the question is if certain PBMs and drug producers raised costs in violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. 
That state law authorizes the state attorney general to investigate when there is reason to believe companies have engaged in fraudulent or deceptive practices. 
“Thousands of Virginians live with diabetes, and none of them should have to worry whether they can afford the medication they need to survive. My Office is investigating the companies behind the soaring cost of insulin to protect Virginia families,” Miyares said in a release announcing the investigation on Tuesday. “My Office will not hesitate to act.”
Miyares co-signs letter urging congressional PBM reform as Youngkin weighs Virginia’s own efforts

Miyares has previously signed onto a national letter urging congressional reforms to PBMs. Meanwhile a bipartisan group of state lawmakers passed the “Save Local Pharmacies Act” earlier this year and it was approved by outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
If implemented, the law will create a single state-contracted pharmacy benefit manager in Medicaid — a move supporters say would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat.
The next governor, either Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, can oversee its rollout. 
Earle-Sears pulled out of a planned interview with The Mercury where she would have been asked various health care questions, to include one about her support or opposition of the PBM reform. Spanberger reiterated her support in an August interview, after previously disclosing it at a campaign event this summer.

A program piloting automated speed enforcement cameras, which Gov. Phil Scott signed into law last year, remains on the drawing board. “Why aren’t we being protected?” one worker asked.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont promised new tech to keep highway workers safe. It still hasn’t arrived..","WILLISTON — Kellen Cloud’s line of work has always been dangerous.
For the better part of the past two decades, Cloud has worked at Green Mountain Flagging, a company that stations traffic controllers at construction sites around the state. He recalled when a coworker had their body pushed by an impatient driver, and when another had to jump out of the way of a truck that would not slow down.
“You have to be a little crazy to do this job,” he said with a laugh, during an interview last month at the company’s headquarters in Williston.
In recent years, though, Cloud said his job has gotten noticeably more dangerous. People seem to be driving more recklessly than in the past, he said — something data suggests could be a lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, data also shows more people are injured or killed in work zones today than a decade ago. 
It’s a concern that led Cloud, along with many others in the state’s construction industry, he said, to support a state plan aimed at bolstering speed enforcement in work zones using relatively new technology: automated cameras. 
The program, which Gov. Phil Scott signed into law in May 2024, would deploy cameras at a small number of highway work zones around the state over a period of 15 months. The cameras would capture photos of the license plates of cars going at least 10 miles per hour over the posted speed limit. After a review by a police officer, speeding drivers would be mailed a warning notice, and if they offended again, could face civil fines.
Under the law, the state was required to start a public outreach campaign about the use of the cameras on April 1, 2025, with a pilot taking effect July 1. But the program — which already exists in some form in more than 15 other states — has yet to materialize.
Vermont Agency of Transportation leaders have said they could not meet the pilot’s deadlines because no law enforcement agency has yet raised its hand to help out. Even though the cameras are automated, under the legislation creating Vermont’s program, a police officer must review the images the cameras collect and send out citations. 
That delay has frustrated some legislative leaders in recent months. They’ve criticized Scott’s administration for failing to implement a program the administration supported — especially when there’s often little consequence for speeding through work zones now.
That’s because while police officers typically park near construction sites with their cruisers’ lights flashing, they’re encouraged to remain at their posts rather than leave to chase down a speeder, several state officials said.
Joe Flynn, Vermont’s transportation secretary, said his agency is committed to getting the pilot program underway, even though it will be on a slower timeline than the Legislature dictated. He said officials are confident the cameras could change drivers’ behavior; data from Pennsylvania, for instance, shows speeding in work zones has dropped by 37% since that state first deployed a similar automated system five years ago.

“We just can’t see this being what we thought it would be,” Flynn said of the program as written in the 2024 law. “We need to just rework it. So that’s what we’re doing.”
But Cloud said that, for him and his colleagues, the safety improvements the cameras could bring are long overdue. Cloud is now Green Mountain Flagging’s operations director, training new employees regularly. He called the delay “frustrating” and “discouraging.” 
“It’s our job to protect,” he said. “Why aren’t we being protected?”
‘Pass a hot potato’
That a program using automated technology would be hobbled by concerns about human staffing seems counterintuitive. But leaders in the Scott administration have been adamant that unless lawmakers remove police officers from the process, the administration may not be able — or willing — to move the program forward.

The legislation states that a “law enforcement officer” has to be the one to issue citations for speeding through work zones, but it does not task a specific agency with that work. However, as the law was being finalized last year, according to Flynn, it was “starting to seem as though this was going to fall squarely” on the Vermont State Police, even though it wasn’t necessarily designed that way. 
During a House Transportation Committee hearing in May, state police leaders insisted they did not have the resources to help facilitate the program. Col. Matthew Birmingham, the director of the state police, said the agency had 54 open positions among its ranks of certified troopers at the time, or about a 17% vacancy rate.
“It just would not make any sense to me,” he told committee members. “There will be something that will have to be given up — and at this point I don’t know what that is because everything we’re handling is violent crime and crimes against people and potentially dangerous crimes like DUI and aggravated aggressive driving.”
Vermont Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison — whose department includes the state police — also pushed back on the idea the state police could take on the work. She told legislators the issue is “not one of our willingness to enforce traffic laws,” but rather “one of resource allocation.” To illustrate her point, she and the department’s policy director, Mandy Wooster, offered estimates of the amount of time it could take officers to review the violations generated by the pilot program each day. 
Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison speaks during Gov. Phil Scott’s weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 12, 2025. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Wooster said part of the challenge would be officers needing to cross-reference the identity of the owner of a speeding car with a database of people who are members of the U.S. military, because soldiers and sailors on active duty can get extended time to pay or contest certain citations, such as speeding tickets, under federal law.
She told the committee that, when accounting for that database check, it could take seven or eight minutes to process each violation. She said the administration had been operating under an assumption there would be a maximum of 1,000 citations issued during a regular, eight-hour workday — which, when multiplied by the time to process each case, could result in well over 100 hours of officers’ time each day.
That’s in addition to extra time required if people who received a violation contested the ticket in court, which is allowed under Vermont’s law as written, Morrison noted.
“I’m not looking to pass a hot potato over to someone else,” the commissioner said. “But I’m very clearly signaling that we do not have the capacity to take this on as the sole owner of this project.”
Rep. Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, speaks as the House Transportation Committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 12, 2025. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Per the legislation, drivers would face no fine for a first offense caught on camera, an $80 fine for a second offense and a $160 fine for a third offense, provided those subsequent violations occurred within a year. A violation would not levy any points on a driver’s license, state officials have said. 
Not everyone agrees with the administration’s estimates, though. Rep. Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, the transportation committee’s ranking member, said Morrison and Wooster were relying on the “worst case scenario” and, in his view, exaggerating the amount of officer time the program would require. If 1,000 people were speeding through work zones every day, he contended, the state had a problem on its hands that warranted addressing immediately.
Pouech pointed to earlier testimony the committee received from a company that makes and operates automated speed enforcement cameras describing how it could take less than one and a half minutes to review each violation.
“The state police clearly just put up a giant smoke screen with their calculations of how much time this was going to take,” Pouech, who’s among the program’s most vocal supporters, said in an interview. “It seems like that was more of an excuse.”

In Pennsylvania — which Flynn said operates the closest example to what is being proposed in Vermont — a dedicated state police unit reviews all automated violations that carry fines, according to a report on the program. Last year, automated cameras were used roughly 2,500 times across 55 different roadway projects in that state. 
Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Sgt. Logan T. Brouse wrote in an email that it takes three minutes for officers to process speed camera violations in that state on average.
Flynn said that, even considering data from other states, he stood by the administration’s time estimates for the program in Vermont. Compared to Pennsylvania, Vermont is a far smaller state with more limited law enforcement resources, he said. 
When Vermont’s state police say they can’t help run the pilot, Flynn said, “I take it on face value — and I don’t question what they say about (their) ability to manage this, or not.”

‘They’re sitting on their hands’
At the same time, officials considered — and decided against — having another statewide law enforcement agency support the program. The Department of Motor Vehicles Enforcement and Safety Division, which is under the purview of the transportation agency, has a number of certified police officers on its staff. 
The “DMV Police” inspect commercial vehicles for safety and conduct their own highway speed enforcement, among other duties, Flynn said. Notably, the force is fully staffed, with Flynn estimating the division has 30 employees statewide.
But Flynn said he was hesitant to commit one or more of his officers’ time to reviewing and issuing citations. The small force’s time, he said, is better spent out in the field where it often backs up other law enforcement agencies, including the state police.
“It just seemed to really be overly burdensome to field forces who otherwise are already fully busy on a daily basis,” he said. “Where can you best use the really highly talented and trained resources that you have, when really, this is an administrative process?”
Flynn said he now plans to meet with leaders from another realm of law enforcement — the state’s 14 county sheriffs — to find out if any of their departments could support the pilot program, rather than a statewide law enforcement agency. 
Lamoille County Sheriff Roger Marcoux, vice president of the statewide association representing sheriffs, said last week he needed to learn more about the program before he could say whether he or his counterparts could take on the additional work. He said conversations about the program seemed like a priority for the state transportation agency. 
Sheriff’s departments already partner with state agencies for some jobs, such as transporting youth who are in the custody of the Department for Children and Families, he said.
However, he continued, “the state police don’t have a monopoly on the staffing issues. You know, I’m short people. And every sheriff’s department is short people.”
Morrison, in testimony to the Legislature earlier this year, suggested lawmakers could also find a way to reconstitute the program so police don’t need to be involved at all. One option could be having the company the state chooses to operate the camera system issue fines to violators, itself, she said. 
Flynn said his agency was working on bill language it could bring to the Legislature for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January, to amend the program. In the meantime, he said the state would “plus-up” the number of officers stationed around work zones who would be tasked, specifically, with pulling over speeders.
Rep. Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House transportation committee, said he would consider any new language the agency presents next year. He said he’s concerned, however, that the timing is such that it could end up being a year from the program’s original effective date that cameras finally make it onto the roads. 
Walker said his committee did not have enough time before the end of this year’s session, which was in mid-June, to make any adjustments to the existing law. During a hearing in late April, he said that from a “sixth-grade social studies perspective,” he was frustrated the executive branch of state government wasn’t following a law the Legislature had passed a year before, regardless of what it was requiring. 
“And at the nine-plus month mark, we are finding out that it’s not going to happen,” he said at the time. “So that is a little bit frustrating.”
Walker’s counterpart in the Senate, Lamoille County Republican Richard Westman, said he also had concerns about the timing of the program, but noted the program has been a larger priority for the House. The Senate Transportation Committee chair said the state transportation agency was short-staffed and has challenges of its own. 
Pouech, the House transportation ranking member, had stronger words. 
“It passed. The governor signed it, and now they’re sitting on their hands,” he said. “I feel bad for the people who work out there. … We have a speeding problem all over the state, and here is a chance to do something about the construction zones.”
A need for more enforcement is what concerns Cloud, the longtime Green Mountain Flagging employee, the most. He said the state has already tried other solutions, like public service campaigns using digital billboards. None of those efforts seemed to have meaningfully changed drivers’ behavior, he said.
He does not think the cameras are the only solution to make drivers more aware of workers on the road, “but it’s got to start somewhere,” he said. 
“If it’s time for some enforcement, then it’s time for enforcement,” Cloud said. “Something has to make them pay attention.”

Reporting Highlights

Paid to Stay: In some of the most flood- and drought-prone parts of the country, subsidies are keeping farmers on land that is no longer productive.
In Dogtooth Bend: One family couldn’t afford to leave their failing land, so they kept planting fields to collect federally subsidized insurance. “It was a nightmare.”
Trump Doubles Down: This year’s budget bill expanded farm support. But the Trump administration cut employees who manage programs that could help pull troubled farmland out of production.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The seed tractor sank again, no surprise to Steve Williams. Everything sank out here on Dogtooth Bend in Southern Illinois since the floodwaters ran through five years earlier and dumped millions of tons of sand. The ground looked firm, but deep pockets of sticky mud lurked under the sun-cracked surface, pulling him under without warning.
He hit the gas. His wheels spun in place; sand flew. A few cuss words, too.
He called his daughter, Brandy Renshaw, working a nearby stretch of field in a giant green rig. She turned his way to pull him out; then she sank, too. Williams, in a faded plaid shirt, gray hair sprouting from under a John Deere hat, paced. Renshaw slammed the gearshift, rocked back and forth, and eventually clawed her way out.
It was June 2024, and both father and daughter knew the land they were trying to farm wasn’t going to yield much, even if they got the seeds in the ground. But this had become their routine: farming futile land just to keep from going under. For years now, they’d had one foot stuck in the mud, the other in government bureaucracy. They’d get angry — then laugh.
“What else could you do?” said Williams, 70. “We were left holding the bag.”
In these Mississippi River bottoms, federal farm policy became a trap. Farming is one of the most heavily subsidized industries in America. Each year, Congress allocates billions to keep crops in the ground, cushioning the blow from droughts, floods, fires and market swings — a safety net that dates to the 1930s, when the Depression and Dust Bowl put the nation’s food supply at risk.
But today, in some of the most flood- and drought-prone parts of the country, those programs can also keep people hanging on, even when it makes more sense to walk away. That’s increasingly clear along parts of the Mississippi River Valley and especially here in Alexander County, at the rural tip of Illinois. As the climate changes and as aging levees fail, the risk is becoming more predictable, the losses so frequent it is clear some land will no longer yield what it used to.
But the federal programs that support those changes — enacted first by President George H.W. Bush, then expanded by President Bill Clinton — have been small, slow and ineffective. After the 2019 flood — when the Mississippi River submerged the southernmost corner of Illinois for months, part of a widespread disaster across the Midwest — Congress allocated only about $217 million spread across 11 states to pay farmers to voluntarily retire their flood-ravaged fields.
Federal workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which ran the program, specifically urged farmers at Dogtooth Bend to sign up. The floods had come here repeatedly and had worsened since they busted through the 17-mile levee that protected Williams’ farmland three years earlier. So Williams signed up, along with about 30 others on Dogtooth Bend, finally ready to call mercy to the river. He offered up roughly 1,200 acres; the federal government offered to pay him about $3,200 an acre to put permanent easements on his land, which he could use for recreational purposes but never farm again.
At the time Williams applied, the program had been offered only one other time in the past decade to farmers along the Upper Mississippi River, despite billions in lost crops. And this time around, the pot — just 1% of the $19 billion disaster aid package — wasn’t big enough to help everyone who applied, especially along this corn- and soy-growing region. And even for those who were accepted, the agency in charge couldn’t keep up with the paperwork, making the process stretch on for years.
The process dragged through the rest of President Donald Trump’s first term and through most of President Joe Biden’s. And now these programs look even less certain as Trump and Republicans in Congress double down on the status quo: expanding crop insurance and farm income supports through the budget bill signed into law on July 4 while — in an effort to trim the federal workforce — gutting the staff responsible for responding to climate disasters, including those who manage permanent easements that pull troubled farmland out of production.
While farmers have struggled to access funds to help them get off flood-prone land, federal programs to keep their crops in the ground have long been the safer bet. Over the past three decades, Illinois has received $35 billion in farm support — more than any state but Texas and Iowa — mostly through insurance subsidies and price supports for growing corn and soybeans. Some of that bounty is grown on flood-prone ground along the Mississippi and other river bottoms.
“At some point in time, don’t you ask yourself: Is this really economically the best way to spend our taxpayer dollars,” said Dave Hiatt, an easement coordinator and biologist with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, “or would it serve us better in the long run if we spent money to take that ground out of production?”
Hiatt is among the USDA employees on paid leave through September as part of the Trump administration’s plan to reduce the federal workforce.
ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois reached out to the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service on Aug. 15 with a detailed list of questions about how it handled the Dogtooth Bend easements across multiple administrations as well as its priorities going forward. The agency said it was working on a response but did not provide it in time for publication or specify a day when it would respond.
While Williams waited for the buyout to go through, his bills didn’t stop. He still owed a mortgage to the bank, taxes to the county. That left him and Renshaw with a choice: Either do nothing and watch their farm operation go under, or do what they’d always done. Even when it didn’t make sense anymore, they had planted their fields to maintain their federally backed crop insurance. Keeping that crop insurance allowed them to access other agriculture subsidies and disaster aid.
So they mounted their tractors and rolled out to their nearly barren fields.
“You can’t afford to leave it,” Renshaw said. “So we planted what we could and insured everything we could. It was a nightmare.”
It hadn’t always been like this. For decades, this Delta-like sliver of bottomland jutting into the Mississippi River at Illinois’ southern edge was “the garden spot of the county,” as Williams put it. He grew up farming alongside his dad and bought his first property on the peninsula in 1987.
At that point, the land on the flood-prone bend was still protected by the Len Small Levee, built in 1943 and named for an Illinois governor. The water broke through the first time in 1993, then again in 2011. But everyone recognized its days were numbered, and the state and federal government started paying people for their homes and businesses so they could move from harm’s way. That mitigated the risk, but it also meant that after floodwaters cut a nearly mile-wide hole in 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declined to cover the $16 million repair cost: With fewer people living there, the cost-benefit formula showed it wasn’t worth saving anymore.
Williams and the other farmers were devastated: When the levee was in place, Dogtooth Bend stayed relatively dry even when the Mississippi climbed well past flood stage — 33 feet at the nearby Thebes gauge. Since the breach, water spills into the peninsula every time the river nears that mark, and that happens often now, sometimes for weeks at a time.
As hopes of a levee repair fizzled, farmers were stranded. The federal easement program receives only sporadic funding, and typically only after a presidential disaster declaration, which Illinois didn’t get in 2016, despite widespread damage in Alexander County.
Predictably, Dogtooth Bend flooded again in 2017 and 2018.
Both years, from his office three hours away near Champaign, Hiatt and a small team of federal officials with the Natural Resources Conservation Service scrambled to come up with easement funds, even outside of a disaster declaration.
“We begged, we pleaded with headquarters,” Hiatt said. “We said, ‘We need these funds right now. These people have been this poorly impacted.’”
Federal records show that after floods in both years, Hiatt and his colleagues in Illinois proposed buying out up to 11,500 acres owned by 40 or so landowners on Dogtooth Bend over time, starting with the most severely damaged. The first phase would cost $20 million and was projected to prevent $60 million in near-term damages. The proposal laid out a strong case: Roads were threatened; habitat was disappearing; land was becoming more and more degraded. Thousands of acres had already become unfarmable — and while the reports also weighed the option of restoring the land, they noted that the farmland would never be fully productive, and the costs to keep bailing out farmers would only grow.
By this point, Trump had taken office for the first time, bringing in new USDA leadership. In both 2017 and 2018, Hiatt said, agency leadership in Washington rejected the requests by him and his colleagues in Illinois to help move farmers off the land. This wasn’t unusual: According to one nonprofit’s report, over 25 years, 90% of landowners in the Upper Mississippi states who applied for funding were turned down.
Environmental groups support paying farmers to leave flood-prone land because floodwater that spreads across farm fields washes fertilizer, pesticides and other chemicals into rivers, causing a range of down-river harms. But there’s an economic argument, too: A 2019 study in the science journal Nature Sustainability found that every $1 spent restoring floodplains by clearing them of development and farms can save at least $5 in future damages.
Despite this, the single largest agriculture program in the farm bill is intended to keep people on the land. That comes in the form of crop insurance premiums, an average of 60% of which are paid by the federal government.
In Alexander County, that is closer to 70%. More broadly, the costs of keeping people on their land there were spiraling upward: In addition to subsidies, there were millions more to clean up flood debris, shore up the levees, and fix roads and drainage systems. And still the floods kept coming.
Yet farmers were still planting. “They do the math,” said Silvia Secchi, a farm policy expert at the University of Iowa, about why farmers might keep investing in troubled land. “You and I would do the same math. If you want to stay in business, you do what makes you stay in business.”
For the father-daughter team of Williams and Renshaw, it was barely enough. “All the insurance did was keep people from going broke,” Williams said.
“You aren’t winning,” Renshaw added, “by any means.”
By the time the historic flood hit in 2019, the need to rescue the farmers at Dogtooth Bend was undeniable.
When the river finally pulled back, Williams no longer recognized the land he’d spent his life working. The levee breach had let the full force of the Mississippi pour through Dogtooth Bend for five months. It carved new channels, dumped dunes of sand and even sucked six barges off the main river and left two stranded in a field. People compared the scene to Mars. To the windswept dunes of “Lawrence of Arabia.” To Williams, it was “just a sickening feeling.”
Farmers in Alexander County claimed more than $7 million in crop insurance payouts that year — the highest on record. Roads were so mangled they had to be fully rebuilt. Trash and driftwood littered the peninsula. The damage made the case for a buyout harder to ignore.
If that case weren’t strong enough, the flood also put on display the benefits of letting the levee go. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ decision not to fix it had hurt the nearby farmers, allowing the water to spread out in Dogtooth Bend may have helped relieve pressure on the levee system across the river in Missouri and downriver.
Williams and Renshaw had come to terms with what that meant. Their land had been sacrificed so others’ could be spared. When Williams signed up for the floodplain easement program in August 2019, he figured he’d never farm Dogtooth Bend again. By that point, only about 200 of their 1,200 acres could still grow a crop. “But do it right,” Renshaw said. Instead, they fell into a broken system that left them farming nearly useless land while they waited five years for the federal government to complete their easement paperwork.
Williams knew the government moved slowly, but his first year’s wait seemed absurd. By year two, he’d nearly given up. By the summer of 2024, he was just plain disgusted. He checked in regularly with federal workers, calling the local officials he knew by name on their cellphones or popping into the local office in nearby Tamms. But the federal workers on the ground couldn’t tell him much other than his paperwork was still in process, under review with a federal official somewhere in another state thousands of miles from Dogtooth Bend. They were frustrated, too.
Danette Cross, who worked for the Natural Resources Conservation Service office in Alexander County until her retirement late last year, said most of the farmers knew her by name and often called her directly, expecting she’d have answers. But to get anything resolved, Cross had to run questions up a chain through a half-dozen people. “I’m not going to say the whole thing was a disaster — they closed on a lot of easements,” she said, “but nothing was timely.”
Hiatt, who had failed twice before to bring in funds for these farmers, tried again in 2019, this time banking their hopes on the emergency aid Congress had earmarked for the program. Hiatt said the Illinois team requested $24 million to buy out everyone who signed up at Dogtooth Bend. The payments are not full market value but allow farmers to invest in drier fields that would be less costly to the federal government in the long run.
But headquarters authorized just under $6 million, which it applied to the very worst fields. Williams’ land was hit hard, but it didn’t make the cut. That meant crop insurance and the other safety net farm bill programs would have to sustain him while he waited.
This wasn’t the only holdup. In 2018, Hiatt said, the agency had created a national team to handle land deals in an effort to improve efficiency. But he said it backfired.
“We were acquiring easements in 500 days” when the Illinois office handled the process on its own, he said. “Now we’ve got this specialized team — they’re taking 800. The math is not working there.”
The head of USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which oversees the crop insurance program, made a personal visit to the wreckage after the floodwaters receded in 2019. Martin Barbre, who led the agency for most of Trump’s first term, knew the area well. He grew up visiting his relatives nearby and himself farms just 100 miles away. In a recent interview, Barbre said he empathized with the farmers and wanted to ensure they got everything they were legally owed through crop insurance.
“I mean, you’ve farmed that ground your whole life. Your family’s owned it for, you know, probably for generations, and here it’s just gone,” Barbre said. He didn’t fault the farmers who kept planting while they waited for a federal buyout. “As long as they’re insured, they have the legal right to do that,” he said. “When I was administrator, I had a saying: ‘I want a producer to get every dime he’s got coming from the program — but not a penny more.’”
In 2020, the USDA leadership released additional funding to purchase easements on Dogtooth Bend. Williams bounced between the two programs. Each required new paperwork — and more time.
In 2021, at a meeting in Olive Branch, Hiatt faced frustrated farmers. “I took a beating,” he said. “And I was glad to take it, because it was poorly administered.”
Three more years passed, and no check had arrived for Williams. But the bills still did.
Although it could barely grow a thing, the county still taxed Williams’ land on Dogtooth Bend like it was prime ground — nearly $40,000 a year, according to Williams, calculated in part on farm productivity from across the state. That number would rise in each subsequent year, including on fields buried under 20 feet of sand. That’s because the rate wouldn’t change until the buyout went through and it was officially classified as conservation land.
As one of the poorest and fastest-shrinking places in America, Alexander County — population 4,600 — leans on farmers like Williams to fund basic government services and keep teachers employed in a school district with just over 300 kids. Farming in Alexander County accounts for $1 in every $7 in the local economy. And as more people move out of the county, there are fewer left to shoulder the tax burden.
Sean Pecord, who farmed on Dogtooth Bend not far from Williams, was one of the first to sign up for the buyout program in 2019; his land was the worst hit. “There was nothing left of it to farm,” he said.
“They work at their own pace,” said Pecord, who along with his wife also runs the nearby Horseshoe Bar and Grill. “If they were operating on normal business terms, they’d be bankrupt in a year.”
Pecord received his payment in late 2023, about four years after he signed up. Williams was finally paid last September. “It’s not what they did,” Williams said of the federal government. “It’s how long they took to do it.”
G. Pang, who lives in nearby Missouri and owns land on Dogtooth Bend with her six siblings, said they’re still waiting to get paid — and for answers. She used to call Hiatt’s personal cellphone when she wanted a status update. But today, the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has been hollowed out, with some 2,400 conservation staffers at home on paid leave through September under the terms of the federal buyout, according to a May report by Politico. Hiatt and his two federal colleagues who oversaw easement purchases in Illinois are among them, as are nearly half the staff of 30 who had been tasked with handling back-end easement paperwork as part of the agency’s national land team.
“Just going in there, taking a chainsaw, removing people and not knowing who you’re going to replace them with, you’re just creating a mess,” Pang said of staff cuts under Trump that have left her family in the dark.
Without the experienced staff, closing on these deals will take even longer, if it happens at all, Hiatt said.
“What’s happening now will never be reversed,” Hiatt said. “Once this is broken, which I don’t know if the break is complete yet, but it’s pretty fractured, I don’t think you can reset that bone.”
Several who joined the buyout were in their 70s and 80s. “They were devastated,” Renshaw recalled.
Williams’ health has deteriorated in the last few years. Macular degeneration has claimed much of his eyesight. Although he’s nearing retirement, he didn’t expect to go out like this.
One of the advertised benefits of the buyout program was that he could take the money and use it to buy farmland elsewhere. But by the time he had his check in hand and was ready to close on new land this year in Alexander County, prices had soared. That means the amount of money he agreed to when he signed on can no longer buy what he’d planned to use it for.
Williams is locked in to the 2020 rate, which is 50% lower than the maximum the government is paying today. If Williams had entered the program today, his land would be worth roughly $2 million more than he agreed to take.
“We could take two acres of that money and buy us an acre up here,” he said. “Now,” he said, “it takes at least three acres of that money to buy an acre up here.”
Part of him regrets signing the papers. The other part knows he didn’t have a choice.
“That monster is still down there,” he said of the river. “It will be back.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8677-700x350-1.jpg,,,2025-09-09 14:57:52.858933

(Getty Images)Indiana University is once again among the worst colleges in the country for free speech, according to a new report released Tuesday by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.
The group’s 2026 College Free Speech Rankings placed IU in the bottom three out of 257 schools surveyed. 
FIRE, a nonprofit civil liberties organization that advocates for academic freedom and free speech, annually surveys college undergraduates nationwide about perceptions of their First Amendment Rights on campuses.
The new report placed IU at No. 255 with an overall score of 43.87 — out of 100 — and a failing grade of F. Only Barnard College and Columbia University ranked as poorly.

2026 College Free Speech Rankings Report
 
In contrast, Purdue University placed second overall, with a score of 76.24 and a speech climate grade of C. DePauw University also ranked in the top 20 nationally, finishing 18th with a score of 71.13 and a grade of C-.
The University of Notre Dame fell in the bottom half of the rankings at No. 238, with a score of 50.42 and a failing grade.
A ‘chilling effect’ on IU’s campus
FIRE officials said in a news release that the lowest-rated schools “are home to restrictive speech policies and some of last year’s most shocking anti-free speech moments.” 
The report singled out IU for what FIRE called a “visible force and invisible voices” chilling effect. 
FIRE pointed to events on IU’s campus last spring as a major driver of its poor ranking. 
Administrators adopted a new policy banning the construction of unauthorized structures in a late-night meeting — just hours before students began setting up a pro-Palestinian encampment. The following day, the university called in state police, who placed snipers on the roof of the student union. 
IU protests and police action draw criticism, defense

“The incident sparked widespread concern among students, contributing to IU’s poor performance in this year’s rankings,” the FIRE report noted.
Roughly a third of IU students said they self-censor in conversations with peers, professors and in classroom discussions, and a majority additionally reported feeling “uncomfortable expressing their views on a controversial political topic” either in class or in a public campus space like the quad, dining hall or lounge, according to the report.
Student survey responses described fear of administrative retaliation. 
One IU student said, “Our administration at Indiana University has publicly and repeatedly silenced students that speak out on controversial topics. I am afraid that I would get retaliation from the administration in terms of a lawsuit, a ban from campus, and expulsion from the university.”
IU also performed poorly across FIRE’s subcategories: 251st on administrative support, 255th on openness, 246th on self-censorship, and 227th on comfort expressing ideas.
Only 23% of IU students said it is “very” or “extremely” clear that the administration protects free speech, while nearly half said administrators were “not at all” or “not very” likely to defend a speaker’s rights during a controversy.
Other Indiana schools
The rankings are based on surveys of more than 68,000 students across the country. FIRE’s new report showed that 166 of the 257 schools surveyed got an F for their speech climate, while only 11 schools received a speech climate grade of C or higher.
It’s not the first time IU has landed near the bottom of the annual free speech census. Last year, the Bloomington school ranked 243rd out of 251, also near the bottom. Before that, in 2024, IU ranked 225th.
Nationally, Purdue University fared far better in the latest report than its in-state counterpart. 
FIRE ranked the West Lafayette flagship campus second in the country this year, behind only Claremont McKenna College. Other top-ranked schools included the University of Chicago and Michigan Technological University.
Other Indiana institutions were not included in the 2026 report. 
Last year, DePauw University placed 36th and the University of Notre Dame 167th. Purdue was also in the top 30.

Bills creating a gerrymandered congressional map and making it virtually impossible to change the state constitution through the initiative petition process are on their way to the Missouri Senate.
The Missouri House gave final approval to both proposals Tuesday after two days of contentious debate. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe called the legislature back into session after weeks of pressure from the President Donald Trump for GOP-run states to redraw congressional districts to ensure more Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. 
In Missouri, the effort targeted the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, by carving it up and dispersing its voters into three districts that give Republicans an electoral advantage in seven of the state’s eight congressional districts. 
“This is a superior map,” said state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican sponsoring the proposed new congressional map. “It better represents the state of Missouri.”

In addition to the gerrymandered map, Republicans also took aim at the citizen initiative petition process. The House approved a plan Tuesday that would require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by Missouri voters to attain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts in order to pass. 
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The proposal would also ban foreign contributions to initiative petition campaigns, something that is already illegal. 
If it passes the Senate, the issue would go on the statewide ballot in 2026 and require a simple majority to approve. 
State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican, said amending the state constitution has become too easy and has been dominated by out-of-state interests. His proposal, he said, would address both of those issues. 
“There should be a broad consensus across the state to amend the constitution,” he said. 
Democrats denounced both of the proposals as a power grab by the Republican supermajority and a Trump-inspired assault on democracy. 
“The Missouri GOP is aiding and abetting the systematic destruction of our democracy by an authoritarian regime led by geriatric conman who knows the only way he can win is to cheat,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat.
GOP state Rep. Bryant Wolfin of Ste. Genevieve was one of the few Republicans who voted against both measures, saying this week’s special session proves that the only thing that matters in the Missouri Capitol is “political power.”
“Unfortunately, it’s not ethics,” he said. “It’s not morality. It’s definitely not liberty. It’s just political power.”
If Democrats were in charge, Wolfin, said, he’s sure they would do the same thing. But that doesn’t justify what Republicans are doing.
“There’s certainly nothing conservative about ignoring the moral implications of our actions,” he said. “Morality is not defined by what is legal. Morality is not defined by what you can get away with.”
 Gerrymandering

Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times. 
Democrats argue it is unconstitutional to draw another map before the next census is complete. 
The Missouri NAACP filed a lawsuit last week in Cole County arguing the governor’s decision to call a special session was unconstitutional. Cleaver has also promised to go to court to challenge any gerrymandered map lawmakers approve.
But Republicans say critics are misreading the constitution and are confident the new map would survive a legal challenge. 
“The constitution is clear that we can alter districts as we desire at any point at any point,” Deaton said. 
Legislators were elected to represent the people, Deaton said, and if a majority of legislators vote in support of the map “that’s representative democracy.”

The new map does not include an emergency clause that would have made it go into effect upon Kehoe’s signature. That means opponents of the map will have 90s days after it is signed into law to collect signatures to force a statewide vote. 
St. Louis Public Radio reported Monday that the Missouri AFL-CIO is considering whether to launch a petition drive to force a referendum vote. If enough signatures are gathered before the law takes effect, it would be held in abeyance until after the vote.
That strategy was last deployed in 2018, when labor unions collected more than 300,000 signatures in 90 days — more than three times the amount needed — to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law. 
The repeal push was ultimately successful, with 67% of voters rejecting the right-to-work law. 
In fact, of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
 Constitutional amendments

Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot. 
Missourians in recent years have used the initiative petition process to legalize abortion and recreational marijuana use, as well expand Medicaid eligibility. 
In November, the abortion-rights amendment passed with just shy of 52% of the vote driven by large support from the state’s urban, more-populated areas. Voters in all but eight of Missouri’s 115 counties opposed the amendment.
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

Lewis argued Tuesday that the process is dominated by liberal, out-of-state organizations who are pushing partisan amendments that would be impossible to pass through the Republican-dominated legislature. 
“Do you want partisan things going into the constitution,” Lewis said, “or do we want something that a broad consensus of all Missourians could support.”
State Rep. Martin Jacobs, a Democrat from Liberty, questioned why the process should be changed to allow a fraction of voters to sink an initiative petition, arguing it violates the principle of one person, one vote. 
“Voters in one district can override voters of every other district,” Jacobs said. 
Based on last year’s general election, where 2,960,266 votes were cast for governor and only 311,915 in the 1st District, under the proposed change only 156,000 voters could defeat ballot question — or just shy of 5.3% of the statewide vote.
The GOP-backed legislation “rigs the system,” said Democratic state Rep. Kathey Steinhoof of Columbia, “and I assure you all Missourians on both sides of the aisle are tired of the system being rigged.”
 On to the Senate

Both bills now head to the Missouri Senate, where Democrats are expected to use the filibuster and other procedural maneuvers to gum up legislative business as much as possible. 
In order to overcome the gridlock, Senate Republicans may once again have to break a filibuster and force a vote by turning to a rule that was previously rarely-used but got deployed twice during the regular legislative session in May. 
Doing so would create even more bad blood in a legislative chamber already teetering on the edge of full on partisan collapse. It could also upend the 2026 session before it even gets started. 
Republican leaders in the Senate are determined to push both measures across the finish line. 
“The map and the initiative petition reform measures will strike a huge blow to progressives and their efforts to turn Missouri into California,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, posted on social media. “We are not California. We are not progressives.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/54521302847_26a750e7d0_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

The mobile MRI unit visits Southwest Healthcare Services, the hospital in Bowman, North Dakota, each Wednesday. Without it, the community’s 1,400 residents would have to drive 40 minutes to get to an MRI machine, an expensive piece of medical equipment the hospital couldn’t afford on its own.
Southwest Healthcare Services and 21 other independent, rural North Dakota hospitals are part of the Rough Rider Network, which used its members’ combined patient rolls to negotiate better prices for the mobile imaging truck.
Independent rural hospitals are increasingly joining what are called clinically integrated networks, collaborative groups that allow them to avoid selling out to larger health systems while sharing resources to save money and improve patient care. Many are motivated by the chance to combine their patient rolls for value-based care contracts, a growing reimbursement model in which insurers pay providers based on the quality of care they provide and the health outcomes of their patients.
Supporters of the networks are exploring whether funding from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — part of President Donald Trump’s recent tax and spending bill — can be used to help start or expand such organizations.

For independent, rural hospitals, the networks are an alternative to shutting down or reducing services, or to giving up local autonomy and joining a large hospital system.
“Anything that can help our rural hospitals and add services is awesome,” said Jacobi, who provides speech therapy to children in the local school district.
Since 2010, 153 rural hospitals in the U.S. have shuttered completely or stopped offering inpatient services, according to the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. A far larger number, 441, merged with or were acquired by hospital systems between 2011 and 2021. That’s according to a report commissioned by the Coalition to Strengthen America’s Healthcare, an advocacy group comprising hospitals and health associations.
The Rough Rider Network provides negotiating leverage to its members, which serve about two-thirds of rural North Dakotans, said Dennis Goebel, CEO of the Bowman hospital.
Health care vendors “probably wouldn’t be talking to us if we’re by ourselves,” he said. “They’re not looking for the little, tiny crumbs. They want a big contract, and they’ll give you better pricing.”
Some rural networks share specialists who aren’t needed full time at any one hospital, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit focused on improving the health care system. Some networks also invest in broadband, housing, and other community development projects that can help people stay healthy and access care.
Hospitals can pool staffers for a network-wide employee health insurance plan, said Nathan White, CEO of Cibolo Health, a company that helps launch and manage networks in rural areas. He said they can also enter shared contracts for telehealth, prescription drug programs, and other services.
White said he started Cibolo Health after a leader from an independent, rural North Dakota hospital asked him about collaborating with similar facilities. The Rough Rider Network launched in late 2023 with assistance from the company and $3.5 million from the North Dakota Legislature.
Since then, Cibolo Health has helped start networks in Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, and Ohio. Once a sixth one opens in September, Cibolo-affiliated networks will represent more than 120 hospitals, with service areas covering 4.7 million people, White said.
The networks, which are nonprofits owned by the hospitals, pay an annual fee to Cibolo Health, a for-profit company, for management services. White said leaders from 10 other states are considering joining this model.
Similar networks have been around for more than 30 years but became more popular after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, according to a report by the Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.
Rural health care providers are increasingly interested in forming such networks, said Marnell Bradfield, executive director of the Community Care Alliance, a network of hospitals and independent primary care offices that launched in 2015 in rural western Colorado. About once a month, she said, she gets a call from health care leaders exploring similar networks and asking about her experience.

The Rand Corp. wrote in its 2020 paper that it didn’t find any academic studies that examined whether these networks do what its supporters claim — save money and improve patient care.
“In theory, quality should improve with the alignment of health care organizations, but there is no evidence,” the report said. The paper also said such networks could end up increasing prices, something that can occur with traditional mergers and acquisitions.
Bradfield and White said they have the evidence, at least for their organizations.
Community Care Alliance members have reduced their insurance costs while improving patient outcomes, such as reducing their need for inpatient and emergency care, Bradfield said.
White said data from a pilot program between Caret Health, a care coordination company, and SMP Health-St. Kateri, one of Rough Rider’s hospitals, showed the program helped a significant number of patients catch up with preventive care.
Gabby Wilkie, finance director at the St. Kateri hospital, in Rolla near the Canadian border, said Caret Health staff called and texted patients who were behind on annual physicals, cancer screenings, vaccinations, and other visits. She said staffers explained to patients why this preventive care is important for their health before setting up a three-way call with St. Kateri staff to schedule an appointment. White said it took an average of 11 outreach attempts before patients came in for any visits.
“To be honest, we didn’t have the resources to reach out,” Wilkie said.
She said St. Kateri would have spent an estimated $300,000 to do that kind of outreach for 1,000 patients. Meanwhile, she said, the hospital estimates it will earn more than $100,000 when that many patients come in for their preventive care. Cibolo Health and the Rough Rider Network both contribute to the cost of the Caret Health service, which is now rolling out to other network hospitals.
Goebel said joining a network to remain independent is also beneficial for the economy of rural areas, where hospitals are often major employers. He said health systems sometimes cut services and staff at rural hospitals they acquire.
Jacobi is taking medication and doing physical therapy after a doctor examined her MRI results. If that doesn’t work, she may need to make a five-hour round trip to Bismarck to get an ultrasound-guided steroid shot. Jacobi was thankful she could get a diagnosis and treatment advice without having to travel far for the MRI.
“Anytime we can maintain more local control, it’s a good thing for our small towns,” she said.

(Photo courtesy Bureau of Reclamation)Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation are urging Republican leaders to prioritize the funding of tribal water settlements, even as President Donald Trump is proposing little to no funding to honor the nation’s longstanding treaty obligations.
State agencies request advance funding for pending Tribal water settlements

In a letter to House and Senate leaders last week, New Mexico’s delegation — all Democrats — and their Republican colleagues in Montana called on House and Senate leadership to prioritize the passage of 10 water settlements, six of which are in New Mexico.
“Completion of these settlements will save taxpayers millions of dollars, provide water access and certainty to Tribal and non-Tribal water users across the West, avoid years of protracted and costly litigation, and support the United States’ trust responsibility to Tribes,” the members of Congress wrote in the Sept. 4 letter.
The letter notes that the settlements have “robust support” and have passed a Senate Committee and received a hearing in a House committee. But Congress has otherwise taken little action on them since members introduced the settlements in February, according to a congressional bill tracker.
New Mexico entered into five settlement agreements in 2022 with the Pueblos of Acoma, Laguna, Jemez and Zia, the Navajo Nation, Zuni Tribe and Ohkay Owingeh. 


The six tribal settlements in New Mexico:

 S.637/H.R.1482 – Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project Amendments Act
 S.562/H.R.1322 – Rio San José and Rio Jemez Water Settlements Act
 S.563/H.R.1323 – Ohkay Owingeh Rio Chama Water Rights Settlement Act
 S.564/H.R.1444 – Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act
 S.565/H.R.1324 – Navajo Nation Rio San José Stream System Water Rights Settlement Act
S.640/H.R.4598– Technical Corrections to the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act



The New Mexico delegation subsequently introduced legislation to approve the deals, including approximately $3 billion to establish funds and build infrastructure. The settlements, which have required years and sometimes decades of costly negotiations, would settle tribal rights for the San José, Jemez, Chama and Zuni rivers.
Two other bills would correct technical errors in established Tribal water settlements and add an extension of both time and money to complete the long-delayed Navajo-Gallup water project. Federal funding granted the project a short reprieve, but it faces an upcoming deadline only Congress can delay.
The Navajo-Gallup project is the most expensive of the projects, with additional pending costs that Congress will need to approve. 
However, President Donald Trump’s budget proposal does not include the roughly $175 million needed for the Navajo-Gallup project. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján recently chastised a federal Interior Department official over the lack of funding, saying failure to pay for the pipeline would be the nation’s first-ever violation of a tribal water treaty.
The Interior Department’s budget request for the fiscal year beginning in October seeks Congressional approval of just $4 million for the Navajo-Gallup project, and it’s one of only two tribal water rights settlements to get any proposed funding, according to the budget request. 
The letter calls on House and Senate leaders to extend the use of Customs User Fees, which the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol collects from international arrivals, to fund the settlements. Congress in 2010 funded four tribal settlements with the use of those fees, the letter notes, adding, “We urge you to consider prior precedent to offset the cost of these proposed settlements and appreciate your consideration.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-29-at-1.46.22-PM-1024x453.png,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

(RTC video screengrab)In Las Vegas, extreme heat can make transit delays caused by a broken down bus especially dangerous for passengers who rely on public transportation.
Transit agencies’ ability to deploy a working bus for passengers waiting in the heat is also hindered by a federal rule that limits the number of spare buses operators can have on hand to 20% of their overall bus fleet.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus, whose congressional district has the state’s highest share of public transit users, introduced a bill Monday that would allow transit agencies to add extra buses to their fleets to prevent disruptions to service during extreme heat events.
Las Vegas needs more spare buses, a federal rule prevents it

The Bus Utilization for Fleet Flexibility and Emergency Resilience (BUFFER) Act would allow transit agencies to increase their spare bus ratio to 30% of their fleet without jeopardizing federal grants if their region regularly experiences extreme weather events.
The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC), which manages more than 400 buses, has struggled to maintain fleet availability due to more frequent service outages brought on by the region’s extreme heat and high transit demand.
Buses in southern Nevada also experience rapid wear-and tear due to long operation hours and a regular influx of millions of tourists a year.
Several bus routes in Las Vegas operate 24 hours a day to accommodate tourism and a non-traditional workforce that requires constant access to public transportation.
“In Southern Nevada and elsewhere, extreme heat takes its toll not only on buses but on the passengers who ride them,” Titus said in a statement. “My legislation will allow the RTC and other transit agencies to increase the number of spare buses they can put into service during bus breakdowns, including those due to extreme heat.”
“Eighty percent of our transit riders rely on buses to get to work and back. Reliable transportation service is critical to both their health and their livelihoods,” she continued.
Transit agencies that go over the spare bus cap risk losing certain federal grants if they aren’t granted an exemption from the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) for additional spare buses. However, the federal agency has never granted a waiver for additional buses to any state.
The bill would create a clear path for exemptions by requiring the FTA to issue regulations and guidance for transit agencies that want to request an increase in the number of spare buses they can have in their fleet. 
Under the bill, transit agencies would need to submit a certification that their region regularly experiences extreme weather events, a description of how extreme weather events disrupt bus operations, and an explanation of how the increase would ensure reliable service. 
Federal funds cover a majority of the expense it takes to purchase a new bus – up to 90% for low or no emissions buses –  through competitive grants, including the Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program. But the cap on spare buses can limit how a transit agency can use those funds for their needs.
Southern Nevada is not alone. Several transit agencies with high-frequency and high-intensity service – especially in regions that are tourism and live entertainment hubs – have reported operational challenges related to the federal cap.
A recent study by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) found that spare bus availability was a common challenge for transit agencies, impacting their ability to meet service demands.
More than 40% of surveyed agencies reported bus availability problems at least a few times per month. A significant majority, 75%, said they believe changing the FTA’s spare ratio policy would greatly improve vehicle availability.
The RTC, which participated in the survey, emphasized that a major challenge for the agency is maintaining a sufficient spare vehicle ratio to meet operational needs.
High transit demand and the extreme desert climate in Las Vegas leads to rapid wear and tear on buses, said the agency, especially for high-mileage buses operating on super heated roads for long hours. Las Vegas roads can reach temperatures of more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, said the RTC.
The adoption of electric buses has also created unique challenges. In the survey, the RTC noted that summer heat can also accelerate the deterioration of batteries in electric buses, increasing maintenance needs and causing downtime, which reduces the fleet’s availability.
“The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada strongly supports revisiting the 20 percent spare ratio policy,” said MJ Maynard-Carey, RTC CEO. “In a region experiencing rapid growth, extreme weather, and large-scale events, added flexibility will help us keep our community moving. Updating this policy will ensure we can continue providing safe, reliable service for the thousands of riders who count on us each day.”
Last week, Southern Nevada’s congressional delegation sent a letter to the FTA asking the federal agency to remove or increase its cap on the number of spare buses transit agencies can own.
“Las Vegas’s vibrant tourism economy depends on reliable transit service to transport millions of visitors, not just year-round residents, especially during major events such as the Super Bowl, Formula 1 Grand Prix, FIFA tournaments, and large concerts,” wrote the delegation.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rtcbuses-1024x570.jpg,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-09 17:33:44+00:00,Mississippi Today,A new home for Mississippi writers on William Faulkner’s old mule farm,Adam Ganucheau,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/09/greenfield-farm-writers-residency/,"Plans for the Greenfield Farm Writers Residency, a retreat-style home for 40-50 writers per year on William Faulkner's old mule farm in north Mississippi, are moving forward.","CORNERSVILLE — It was impossible not to wonder what William Faulkner might think of what was happening on his land on a drizzly, humid Sunday last fall.
Several of Mississippi’s up-and-coming artists drew, painted and photographed the depths of the landscape around us. A saxophonist and accordionist played some folk melodies, their riffs echoing off a rotting wooden house and a scattering of oak trees. Joe Stinchcomb, one of the South’s best bartenders, slung gin cocktails from a folding table for more than 100 people who’d trekked out in their mud boots and rain jackets.
We were deep in the woods for the Plein Air Invitational, an artist showcase hosted by the University of Mississippi at Greenfield, Faulkner’s old mule farm 17 miles east of Oxford toward his hometown New Albany. This ground, though much less visited than the literary icon’s home Rowan Oak in Oxford, is sacred to those who know it.
After he sold the movie rights for his novel “The Unvanquished” in 1938, Faulkner bought 362 acres here, where generations of Faulkners and tenant families such as the McJunkinses grew cotton and corn over the years. The fields, trees and trails tucked away in these hills served as literary inspiration for many stories people now obsess over. From 1938 to 1945, when Faulkner spent much of his time at Greenfield, he worked on “The Hamlet,” “Go Down, Moses,” and “A Fable.” In “Absalom, Absalom!”, Faulkner’s map of Yoknapatawpha County placed the fictional McCallum farm on the very site of Greenfield Farm. Puskus Creek, which flows east to west through the property, became the setting for the quicksand scene in the film adaptation of “Intruder in the Dust.”
After his passing in 1962 and the changing of owners over the years, the property fell into neglect. The farm failed and went into foreclosure around 1990, when a local bank sold 20 acres of the land to the University of Mississippi. For nearly three decades in the university’s possession, the property was largely unused, save for a few field trips of the annual Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference. During this time, much of the history of the place was lost.
Sometime in 1992, Faulkner’s hunting cabin on the property burned. What remains of the farm’s structures are badly decomposing in the elements. There are no signs or markers signifying the place’s import, and there has been little reason to visit the land or even know it existed unless you knew someone who knew.
That’s all changing now. The 100 or so people who visited last fall had gathered for an art exhibition, yes. But their primary reason for coming out was not just to pay respect to the land’s importance and history, but to celebrate its future.
Attendees stood that day on the very site of what will become the Greenfield Farm Writers Residency, a retreat-style home for 40-50 writers per year. There will be a gathering lodge with offices, a library and a kitchen. Writers will have their own cabins to rest, write and focus. Overnight residents will receive a $1,000-per-week stipend.
So what would Faulkner, whose words have been parsed by generations of scholars and readers, think of all this?
“Later in his life, Faulkner advocated for solitary time and dwelled on the importance of writers having isolation and time to do their work,” said John T. Edge, the visionary and director of the Greenfield Farm Writers Residency. “We’re working intentionally to honor and build just that. A whole lot of people had planned for many years to responsibly leverage the Faulkner profile on this land to build something just like this.
“Mississippi is a state that depends on its writers, I would argue, more than any other to tell its story,” Edge continued. “So we’re going to offer Mississippians and anyone who feels some connection to Mississippi the place, the stipend, the time they need to plan, start, or finish their work.”

This project, for years just a vision and appealing concept drawn up on some fundraising material, just cleared its biggest benchmark yet.
In late August, the Institutions for Higher Learning board voted to approve the exterior design of the buildings on the property, a major step toward full approval of the construction process. Project leaders have raised $4.6 million for Greenfield Farm thus far, including a $750,000 legislative appropriation. Fundraising for additional capital costs and a separate $3 million endowment continues.
Multimillion dollar developments take time and plans often shift, but Edge said last week that project leaders hope to open the construction bid process this fall, they hope building will begin in the spring of 2026, and they hope to host a first cohort of residents in early 2027.
Several people have lent their expertise and perspectives to the project, but Edge is the leader of the endeavor. An accomplished author himself who is touring his new book ‘House of Smoke,’ Edge leads an initiative called The Mississippi Lab, a University of Mississippi-sponsored humanities laboratory for the state of Mississippi.
The idea for Greenfield Farm Writers Residency developed out of this initiative.
“I talk to a lot of writers. I claim a community of writers,” Edge said when asked about his drive for the development of Greenfield Farm. “We all ask each other, ‘Where’d you go to finish that book?’ or ‘How did you find time to write that draft?’ So many of them talk about the writers residences, trips to places like MacDowell in New Hampshire or Hedgebrook in Washington state. Beth Ann Fennelly just finished her new book ‘The Irish Goodbye’ at Loghaven just outside Knoxville. I finished my last book ‘The Potlikker Papers,’ the majority of it, at Rivendell near Sewanee. Writers of all sorts use these residencies.”
Edge is not doing this work alone. He’s leaned on a star-studded committee of advisors including Fennelly, Ralph Eubanks, Kiese Laymon, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Ebony Lumumba, and Natasha Trethewey — renowned Mississippi writers who know exactly how residencies can bolster the creative process.
“A residency gives you time away from the day-to-day,” said Eubanks, a faculty fellow and writer-in-residence at the University of Mississippi Center for the Study of Southern Culture, who finished his upcoming book “When It’s Darkness on the Delta” at a residency in Cambridge. “I didn’t have to think about meals, my job, anything other than my writing. Most of us who are doing this type of work, we take slices out of our day to keep routine going. What a residency does is pulls you out of that routine and gives you a period of intense focus. We are in a culture where time and attention are very valuable things. To have a place where you can have the time and you can devote the attention to the work is invaluable.”
The Greenfield planning group is thinking deliberately about details large and small. How should the kitchen be designed, and what types of food will be served? How much sunlight will enter the writer’s cabins during the summer, and how much shade will the property offer during the winter after the oaks have shed their leaves? What type of bed is most comfortable for rest, and where in the cabins should the reading chairs go?


The logo design for the residency features a turkey buzzard, an ode to Faulkner’s 1958 quote: “… if I were reincarnated, I’d want to come back a buzzard. Nothing hates him or envies him or wants him or needs him. He is never bothered or in danger, and he can eat anything.”
One thing that will set Greenfield apart from other writers’ residencies is the stipend for overnight residents who are selected. Edge and the advisers focused considerable attention — and are still working hard to fundraise — to this idea.
“Traditionally, residencies have been the province of the upper and upper-middle class,” Edge said. “But writers of all economic strata need access to this kind of asset. How can we make it possible for people who may not earn a lot per year but they want to take a month off to start or finish a book? To do that, they’d be giving up a huge chunk of their income and their family could suffer. So we plan to level the playing field and put a stipend in their pockets. We want anyone, regardless of their economic status, to be able to take advantage of this asset.”
And, of course, a primary focus of the project planners is Mississippi. Edge, who says University of Mississippi leaders and particularly Provost Noel Wilkin have been immensely supportive of the project, said the university will have no say in the application process.
Evidence of this full-state focus is clear even before construction begins. The Plein Air Invitational last fall was cohosted with Jackson State University, and this fall’s artist invitational on October 19 will be cohosted with Mississippi State University. Donations for the project have come from the Julia Reed Charitable Trust in Greenville, the Gertrude C. Ford Foundation in Jackson, the Robert M. Hearin Support Foundation in Jackson and numerous donors across Mississippi.
“This will be a UM asset, but it is being built to serve the entire state,” Edge said. “This will be a place of production and a place to make new content for all of Mississippi. And we’re thinking about Mississippi in the broadest kind of way. If you were born here, you’re certainly welcome. But what about someone from, say, Chicago, whose Mississippi roots go back four or five generations? Absolutely. We will open our doors to anyone who feels some connection to the state.”
One doesn’t have to be a literary buff to know that Mississippi produces more than its fair share of impactful writers. But the writers we already know aren’t the full story here, Greenfield planners say.
“We are the seat of storytellers,” Eubanks said. “But my excitement about this is it will help us really enhance the work of the next generation of our state’s storytellers. There are so many stories across this state that are buried or truly hiding in plain sight. People who want to tell those stories might not yet have found the right path to tell them. This residency could be life-changing for them and for us all.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/08101035/Screenshot-2025-09-08-at-10.10.22-AM.jpg,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Supreme Court's video)TOPEKA — The attorney for a prominent Kansas financial institution urged the Kansas Supreme Court to derail a class-action lawsuit challenging imposition of obscure bank fees and limiting to 30 days the timeframe for customers to contest transaction penalties.
A Shawnee County District Court judge granted a motion from Capitol Federal Savings Bank for dismissal of the lawsuit in October 2024. Plaintiffs Jennifer Harding and Samantha Ramirez pivoted to the Kansas Court of Appeals. The three-judge appellate panel reversed the district court after concluding “erroneous” reasoning was relied upon to dismiss breach of contract claims against Capitol Federal.
Capitol Federal, a Topeka company serving Kansas and Missouri customers and listing assets of $10 billion, filed an appeal with the state Supreme Court.
In oral argument Monday, justices and attorneys focused on whether plaintiffs should have been allowed by District Judge Merlin Wheeler to proceed to a jury trial.
The justices considered ambiguities in Capitol Federal’s fine-print document outlining the meaning of “improper charges,” which the Court of Appeals said wasn’t written in a manner to be “inherently clear.” Supreme Court justices weighed consequences of a customer overdrawing a bank account as well as obligations of customers when contesting fees imposed on account holders.
Supreme Court justices considered the appropriateness of Capitol Federal’s requirement that its customers raise concerns about potentially improper charges within 30 days of Capitol Federal sending an account statement or forever lose the right to contest the issue.
“That provision only serves a purpose of limiting Capitol Federal’s liability, right?” said Justice Dan Biles, who has served on the Supreme Court since 2009.
Justice Caleb Stegall, who was appointed in 2014 by Gov. Sam Brownback, also brought up Capitol Federal’s 30-day window for customers to object to fees or charges.
“Where do we draw the line?” Stegall said. “What if the contract just said, ‘You’re banned from bringing any claim against (Capitol Federal), period?’ Why is it that the courthouse doors are just slammed shut?”
In September 2022, Harding’s lawyers filed the lawsuit against Capitol Federal to challenge the fee assessed her for a purchase that was authorized when she still had a positive balance in her checking account. Harding said it was a violation of the customer agreement for the bank to charge her a $32 overdraft fee on that transaction, because it was settled when the account no longer had sufficient funds to cover the purchase.
Ramirez joined Harding’s suit in October 2022 after alleging Capitol Federal broke the account agreement by charging her a fee each time AT&T attempted to collect on a $164.87 bill. She asserted nothing in the customer agreement gave Capitol Federal authority to assess the $32 overdraft fee three separate times on a single debit card item.
Kersten Holzhueter, who represented Capitol Federal, told the Supreme Court that the district court’s dismissal of the class-action lawsuit was proper. The fees at the core of the suit were permitted by the customer contract, she said.
In response to Stegall, she said a complete prohibition on lawsuits by account holders against Capitol Federal wouldn’t likely be allowed in Kansas. She said the 30-day limit in terms of challenging fee assessments was reasonable.
“They key issue to discuss here today, and reinforce in Kansas, is that not all petitions present questions that warrant discovery or trial,” Holzhueter said. “Having a bank account comes with obligations on the bank, but it also has responsibility for the account holder. This includes an obligation to notify Capitol Federal of certain disputes.”
David Seeley, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said his clients’ objections to Capitol Federal’s business practices should be allowed to move forward in district court.
“Plaintiff needs to have the opportunity to pursue these claims and shouldn’t be required to terminate them at the outset,” he said.
Seeley said monthly statements issued by Capitol Federal to account holders didn’t take into consideration complex circumstances in which an account could have been overdrawn.
“You know that if you are an expert on banking or banking law, and understand that this is a problem that is nationwide,” Seeley said.
He echoed the Court of Appeals, which declared in its opinion that “contrary to the district court’s ruling otherwise, nothing in the plain language of the notice provision clearly and unambiguously proves that the disputed bank fees are a type of charge that a consumer must report to Capitol Federal under the account agreement.”
Seeley said the 30-day notice provision imposed by Capitol Federal shouldn’t apply to impermissible fees the company charged its customers. He said the time restraint was fundamentally unfair.
“The court needs to be mindful that you are locking the doors to the courthouse if you uphold a provision like this,” Seeley said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kansas-Supreme-Court-chamber.png,,,2025-09-09 13:57:28.334079

(Photo by Dana Edwards/CT Mirror)Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.
Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.
The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.
Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.
While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.
“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”
According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.
In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.
Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.
Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.
The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.
In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.
Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.
But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.










This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island. It's actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.


– Connecticut DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes


Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.
“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”
In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.
While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.
“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.
One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.
“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”
In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.
Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.
However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.
“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate
Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.
Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)
“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”
Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.
Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.
Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.
Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.
A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.
Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.
“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.
At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.
State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.
Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.
“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”
Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.
While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.
“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”
Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia officials slammed Dominion Energy’s proposed peaker gas plant slated to be built in Chesterfield at an air permit hearing Monday night, as community members and their representatives said the pollution in the air will be too great.
“I don’t understand how we impose upon a community that’s been put upon over 70 years with serious air pollution of a coal plant that is finally breathing freely,” said Glen Besa with the Friends of Chesterfield advocacy group. “Now to be put upon to endure the air pollution associated with this plant.”
Meanwhile, business advocates supported the project, saying they want to be certain the lights turn on when they flip the switch. The company said the plant is critical for meeting demand.
The proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center would be built on the site of a former coal-fired power plant that  closed its doors two years ago after burning for over 70 years. Two gas units are still operational on the property and produce about 450MW of energy. The proposed project would only run about 37% of the time during peak demand days, such as the hottest and coldest days of the year. It’ll power up in a matter of minutes to assist the regional power grid to ease strain.
 

 
 
Twenty state legislators have signed on to a letter asking the State Corporation Commission to reject Dominion’s application of necessity and for the Department of Environmental Quality to reject the air permit. The letter explains how the state has committed to the Virginia Clean Economy Act that mandates utilities to be using 100% renewable energy sources by 2050.
September 2025 Letter - Chesterfield Peaker Plant.docx
“I call on the DEQ to deny Dominion’s air permit, and also call on Dominion to change course and instead help us lead the way so Virginia can do a true, clean energy transition,” said state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, who is also running for lieutenant governor.
Hundreds of members of the Chesterfield community and surrounding areas came to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality hearing for the air permit on Monday night. Since the coal plant closed down, the air quality in the area has improved. The department said that the so-called peaker plant will be significantly less polluting than the previous coal plant. 
The area near the plant has a high population of Black and Hispanic community members, many people in the community being Spanish-speaking. Advocates who spoke at the meeting said the plant could add to worsening health outcomes in the area, and the greenhouse gases will contribute to climate change that threatens the state.
“We need to move to cleaner energy sources due to our severe climate crisis. The number of 100-year storms and 500-year storms in our country, in our region, have increased immensely. The gas put out by this plant would not help that at all,” said Jessica Schneider, a Chesterfield County supervisor.
People at the meeting in favor of the plant donned stickers stating their support for reliable energy. Some said there are not enough renewable energy projects to manage the energy load the state is facing in the coming years.
“The Commonwealth must ensure businesses have access to dependable power, particularly during periods of high demand,” said Keith Martin, the CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “The ability to generate power on demand at any time and in any condition, is essential to maintaining grid reliability. Without a constant, always available power supply, the grid is vulnerable.”
The department uses air monitors inside the smoke stacks of plants to ensure they are not going over their allocated amount of pollutants. There are also community monitors to read the ambient air quality. 
“Emission reduction systems designed to reduce nitrogen oxide, carbon oxide, and other emissions will be added to the new units. CERC will always utilize newer, more efficient turbines that minimize the CO2 emissions,” said Kevin Battle with the boilermakers union, who hopes to build part of this project.
Those opposing the plant said the monitors are too far away from the plant and not accurate enough to get a read on how much people in the surrounding areas are breathing in. With the coal plant recently shutting down and coal ash still being removed from the site, they said  more pollutants should not be added to the air.
“I know there are options that are there,” said Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond. “And so I would just ask that Dominion and all the parties involved would find a better place to locate this and a better way in which to meet our energy demands.”
The roughly $1.4 billion construction project would be able to generate up to 1000MW of energy — enough to power 250,000 homes — and is anticipated to come online in 2029 if approved. It will add an estimated $1.36 to the average customer’s bill for the entire life of the project, which would span decades. That comes as Dominion is arguing to the State Corporation Commission to raise the base rate an additional $10 over the next two years. Dominion said this project is important to ensure there is grid reliability moving forward as power use increases.
“Without this facility, predictions show significant reliability risk in the near term. Speaking as a professional engineer, I believe we have presented compelling evidence of those risks for our regulators and the SCC,” said Cedric Green, the senior vice president of energy generation at Dominion.
Mark Miller, a Chesterfield county supervisor, said the new fusion plant that is also slated for the area will take away the need for the peaker plant. The nuclear energy plant is a first of its kind in the state and is expected to put 400 MW of energy on the grid by the early 2030s, according to Commonwealth Fusion Systems. A Dominion spokesperson said fusion plants are an emerging industry and that it does not have to be one or the other in an “all of the above” energy profile.
Dominion will present its case for the project to the SCC on Tuesday, Sept. 23. A decision is expected several weeks later.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences formally began its national search for a new chancellor Monday by releasing a leadership profile and beginning to accept inquiries about the post, according to a news release. 
Leaders of the state’s only academic medical center are searching for a replacement for Dr. Cam Patterson, who announced in June he was stepping down after seven years for personal and medical reasons and returning to a faculty position. UA System President Jay Silveria named Dr. Lowry Barnes, professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, interim chancellor, a role he began July 11.  
A search advisory committee is assisting Silveria with identifying candidates for the position, according to the release. 
“It goes without saying how critical this position is for the UA System and the state, as we seek a leader who can build on the excellent foundation laid by our faculty, staff, students and senior leaders,” Silveria said in a statement. “We are looking for someone who can take UAMS to the next level in each of its core mission areas of education, patient care and research, and who can help build a high-quality health care system for Arkansans in every corner of the state.”
The leadership profile released Monday will be used to recruit potential candidates by WittKieffer, an executive search and leadership advisory firm that is assisting UAMS and the UA System in the search process, according to the release.  
The recruitment phase of the search process may take several months, according to Dr. William J. Steinbach, advisory committee chair, UAMS chair of pediatrics and associate dean of child health. 
Steinbach said the goal of the committee is to develop a competitive pool of candidates to assist Silveria, who is tasked with recommending a finalist to the Board of Trustees, which is responsible for approving chancellor appointments. 
“UAMS is at a critical inflection point where we have the unique opportunity to identify candidates who can help shape a new trajectory for both this institution and for health care across our entire state,” Steinbach said. “We will take the time necessary to cast a broad net across the country to find superb candidates for this position who can transform this medical university for the next decade.”
More information is available on a website dedicated to the search.

Josh Cockroft, who serves as Oklahoma’s secretary of state and as Gov. Kevin Stitt’s chief policy advisor, announced on social media that he is resigning effective Oct. 2. He was appointed in 2023 by Stitt to serve as secretary of state and chief policy advisor. 
Cockroft, who is also a former state lawmaker, said it’s been an “honor” to serve the state of Oklahoma. In a letter he addressed to the governor dated Aug. 18, Cockroft thanked Stitt for his trust. 
“As I reflect on our accomplishments I can’t help but be filled with immense pride in what we’ve achieved together,” he wrote in the letter. “The unwavering pursuit of your guiding principles has shaped every decision you’ve made, and I have been incredibly blessed to be part of this movement.”
Crockroft and the Governor’s Office did not return requests for comment, but in a post on X, Cockroft said he’s “excited to announce a new chapter soon.” 
Cockroft’s resignation comes as Stitt also searches for a replacement for Rick Rose, the head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and who also serves as Oklahoma’s chief operating officer.
Rose tendered his resignation, effective Sept. 26, on Monday just over a year after being appointed to the position. His resignation followed a dispute with Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. 
Drummond said he sent Stitt a letter questioning Rose’s decision not to approve requests to purchase vehicles for agents in his office and whether or not this was at Stitt’s direction. He said Rose denied the purchase because he wanted to know why Drummond’s employee count had grown. 
In a statement provided late Monday evening, Rose denied Drummond’s claim that he resigned because of the attorney general’s letter. 
He said he was planning to resign before any letter was sent to the governor. 
“Under state law the OMES Director holds the authority to approve or deny agency vehicle purchases,” Rose said. “It’s up to the agency to justify the need for that vehicle. This helps promote responsible spending of state dollars. OMES contacted a number of agencies and does not seek a personal battle with the AG. While other agencies complied with the request, the AG chose to write an accusatory letter to the governor.”

This week, Republican members of the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee, as well as several other state representatives and senators, wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. The Maine lawmakers praised the Trump administration’s actions to stop new offshore wind leasing, given their concerns about offshore wind projects posing a threat to the fishing industry and coastal communities. 
“Floating offshore wind remains too experimental, too costly, and too disruptive for the people of Maine to bear,” the letter, which was authored by Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport), concludes.
The lawmakers are asking the administration to go further by revoking the four leases in the Gulf of Maine that were auctioned in 2024 and terminating the lease for the Maine Research Array. It also asks to cancel the upcoming bottom trawl survey of the research array area, and for “a comprehensive review of offshore wind regulations to prioritize affordable, reliable, proven energy sources.”  
The letter comes weeks after the Trump administration abruptly cancelled Revolution Wind, a wind project off the shore of Rhode Island that is already 80% complete. That case is now playing out in a Boston federal court.

This isn’t the first time Maine Republican lawmakers have made such a request. 
On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order for a temporary halt in new or renewed offshore wind leases in all areas of the outer continental shelf. It also included a review of the federal government’s leasing and permitting process for existing wind projects. 
Shortly after, Paul drafted a letter on behalf of her caucus colleagues to Trump and Burgum thanking them for that initial executive order and asking them to end the existing leases, the same plea in the latest letter. In February 2024, the state announced its hope to build an offshore wind port in Paul’s district to support its larger goal to develop 3,000 megawatts of wind power in the Gulf of Maine by 2040.
The letter sent Tuesday states that Mainers are suffering under high electricity rates, claiming a 36.3% rate increase over the past year. Although ratepayers have seen an increase, state officials have pushed back on that specific number, saying that it doesn’t reflect the reality of residential energy bills. 
Though Republican lawmakers have repeatedly argued that the price hikes are the result of Gov. Janet Mills’ and Democratic lawmakers’ climate policies, electricity rates are made up of multiple cost components that are affected by global markets, state policy and private utility companies. 
Additionally, a new study from Daymark Energy Advisors shows that electricity prices in New England could have been 11% lower last winter if contracted offshore wind projects had been operational. That would have translated to about $400 million in savings for ratepayers throughout New England, the study found. 
As Maine has set clean energy and climate goals, developing offshore wind as a power source has been at the crux of meeting those ambitions. The Governor’s Energy Office released a technical report last December showing that while it is possible to meet the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040, wind and solar are key components of meeting increased electrification demands from plug-in cars and heating options.

But the first-in-the-nation stockpile would still have thousands more pills not set to expire for a few more years.
Then-Gov. Jay Inslee authorized the purchase of the first 30,000 doses of mifepristone in 2023 as a three-year insurance policy in case the drug was no longer available due to restrictions at the federal level. In Washington, that hasn’t been an issue — at least yet. 
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, mifepristone and misoprostol, the two abortion-inducing drugs, have become key for people to continue accessing the procedure, as some Republican-led states have banned abortion. 
Some states have also looked to limit access to the drugs.
For Washington, the bigger threat is federal regulation. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly signaled a willingness to limit access to mifepristone. While testifying before Congress last week, he suggested rolling back access to abortion pills expanded under the Biden administration.
In July, a federal judge in eastern Washington sided with the federal government, ruling that providers must be certified specifically to prescribe mifepristone. The Biden administration imposed that rule in the wake of safety concerns about the medication. 
Washington and other states argued this would be a barrier to access, and noted research attesting to the drug’s safety. The July decision overturned the judge’s own previous ruling blocking the stricter federal requirements for prescribers. 
The decision disappointed state Attorney General Nick Brown, but he has emphasized that it had “no immediate impact on access to mifepristone here in Washington.”
“My office stands ready to fight any unlawful attempts to curtail mifepristone’s availability here,” he added.
The stockpile’s future
Though the state could soon destroy 30,000 pills, a mifepristone stockpile will remain.
Inslee OK’d the purchase of another 17,600 doses shortly before leaving office in January, costing $757,000. Washington’s initial 30,000 doses of mifepristone, sitting in a state Department of Corrections facility since 2023, cost $1.275 million, said agency spokesperson Christopher Wright.
The cost for incinerating the pills is expected to be less than $1,000.
The state can only provide mifepristone to qualified clinics and prescribers, and has to sell it for at least the price for which it was purchased, said Brionna Aho, spokesperson for Gov. Bob Ferguson. But providers can still get pills for less from wholesalers. 
“We continue to be open to options to utilize the stockpile before it expires, but at this point, there is not a demand for it,” Aho said.
The extra 17,600 doses expire in late 2028 and early 2029, Aho noted. On that purchase, the supplier agreed to accept unused doses when they expire and exchange them for new pills at no cost to the state. So destroying those pills will likely be unnecessary. 
A separate stockpile of misoprostol expiring in February and March 2026 may also need to be destroyed, Aho said. 
University of Washington Medicine had its own 10,000-pill stockpile of mifepristone. All of it has been distributed to clinics in the state, said spokesperson Susan Gregg.
Fight over the drug isn’t finished 
The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to mifepristone from abortion opponents due to a legal technicality, preserving access. 
Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are now asking a federal judge in Texas to make it much harder to get prescribed mifepristone, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2000.
“That’s the real threat that we are watching,” said Courtney Normand, the Washington director of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.
“If things go south in Texas,” Normand said, “then mifepristone access nationwide will be blocked.”
Meanwhile, the most significant recent blow to abortion access in Washington is an $8.5 million cut included in this year’s biennial state budget. Normand and other advocates are urging lawmakers to restore this funding for abortion services in next year’s legislative session.
In 2024, medication abortions accounted for about 68% of all abortions in Washington. Of more than 14,500 medication abortions that year in the state, providers reported complications in 135 cases, according to the state Department of Health. The most common complications were that the pill didn’t work. Fewer than 0.2% resulted in hospitalization.
More than 3,000 of those medication abortions were conducted via telemedicine, according to state data.
Last month, Brown and attorneys general in more than a dozen other states petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to remove restrictions on mifepristone access, including the prescriber certification requirement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mifepristone-tablets.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 12:58:28.823025

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Senate Democratic leaders are demanding that George Mason University’s Rector Charles Stimson step down, saying his position as a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation is a conflict of interest, as the university navigates federal investigations centered on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that federal leaders are working to eradicate on college campuses nationwide.
The U.S. Department of Education claimed last month that GMU’s hiring practices violated civil rights law. In response, the school’s governing board stated that it wishes to negotiate a resolution with the agency, despite its president Gregory Washington’s attorney pushing back against the proposal.
But in the past week, Senate Democratic leaders learned that conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation published a Sept. 2 report titled “Uncovering Radical Efforts to Disguise DEI,” while state Democrats said “targets” and “undermines” the university and Washington, and prompted them to call for Stimson to vacate his role as rector at GMU. The report also recommends the federal government withhold funding from institutions, including George Mason.
“As Rector, you have fiduciary duties to advocate for the university’s best interests, including securing necessary federal funding,” the Democratic leaders’ letter stated. “Yet your employer has publicly advocated for actions that would directly harm the institution you lead.”
The letter signed by Senate Democratic leadership — Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton — also called on Stimson to recuse himself from Washington’s employment status or performance evaluation, any university responses to federal DEI investigations or compliance matters, university funding strategies — particularly those involving federal sources and any matters related to the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or policies. 
“Virginia’s public universities deserve board leadership that is uncompromisingly committed to their success and welfare. The current situation places you in a position where your employer’s interests may conflict with your fiduciary duties to George Mason University, its students, faculty, and the commonwealth,” the lawmakers’ letter read.
The Mercury contacted GMU for comment from Stimson but has not heard back.
George Mason’s Board of Visitors has only six voting members primarily due to Democrats rejecting multiple appointments made by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in addition to other university boards. The appointees, Democrats said, have introduced additional “controversy” and “division,” and have “abdicated” their responsibilities.
Feds claim GMU’s hiring practices violated civil rights law; GMU president’s attorney pushes back

Democrats sent a second letter on the same day to university rectors at the Virginia Military Institute, University of Virginia and George Mason urging them to acknowledge that none of the appointments are to be recognized after being rejected by the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections. A circuit court judge temporarily blocked the appointees from serving on the boards as the matter plays out in court. 
Stimson is not the first member to be called on to step down from the GMU’s governing board. Last summer, Democrats called for the removal of Lindsey Burke, whom Youngkin appointed. She is one of the authors of Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House — produced by the Heritage Foundation. 
Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, called for her removal because her “extreme views are alarming and contradicts the commonwealth’s efforts.”
The governor said he had no intention of removing Burke, who was the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation. However, she left the board before the end of her term to accept the role as deputy chief of staff for Policy and Programs with the U.S. Department of Education.
The executive committee of American Association of University Professors for George Mason University wrote in a four page letter released Tuesday that it supports Democrats’ request for Stimson to step down.
Stimson joined the board on July 1, 2023 after being confirmed by the General Assembly. His term ends June 30, 2027.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-09 16:00:23+00:00,CT Mirror,Where are driverless cars going in New York City?,Jose Martinez | THE CITY and Samantha Maldonado | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/09/driverless-cars-waymo-nyc/,"Waymo—a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company—has, since at least 2019, poured more than $3M into lobbying city and state leaders.","This story was originally published by THE CITY. Sign up here to get the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to you each morning.
Years before Mayor Eric Adams gave Waymo the green light to test its robot cars in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, the company spent millions trying to woo public officials in hopes of someday having its autonomous vehicles cleared to cruise New York City streets.
Lobbying records reveal that Waymo — a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company — has, since at least 2019, poured more than $3 million into lobbying city and state leaders, who would need to change a law that prohibits driverless cars.   
“We understand that as we operate in new areas, it’s on us to explain our approach,” Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, told THE CITY. “That’s why our engagement with lawmakers is important — it reflects our commitment to explaining how our technology works and sharing our proven experience.”
Before New Yorkers can even think of hopping aboard self-driving cars, robo-vehicles face several hurdles that extend well beyond the end of this month, when a Waymo testing permit Adams approved in August expires. Autonomous-vehicle technology has previously been tested in Albany and Buffalo.
State law mandates that vehicles must be operated by humans, and even if that were changed, the city would also need to develop rules regulating self-driving cars. Multiple legislative efforts to that effect in the state legislature and the City Council have gone nowhere in recent years. 
Driverless vehicles were legalized as part of the 2018 state budget, but in order to be operational on the road a licensed driver must be behind the wheel. Companies have to apply to the state Department of Motor Vehicles for approval to operate on city streets. (And if the companies set their sights on the boroughs, they would need a go-ahead from the city Department of Transportation.) 
A state bill introduced in Albany would undo the requirement for a human driver — provided the autonomous vehicle carries insurance and meets certain other conditions. The bill has not moved forward despite being around since 2021.
Assemblymember Brian Cunningham (D-Brooklyn), who sponsored the bill in the lower chamber, said shaking off the requirement to have a person in a self-driving car would “begin to unlock some of the restrictive red tape that has held back the industry” from fully operating in New York state.
The bill’s other sponsor, Sen. Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester), who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said he is optimistic it will make headway this session. Initially the legislature required a person to be inside the vehicles to better ensure the technology’s safety.
“The technology has evolved,” he said. 
Then there is opposition from the more than 175,000 Taxi and Limousine Commission-licensed operators of yellow taxis and for-hire vehicles such as Uber and Lyft.
“Unlike other cities, New York is a place where driving is a full-time profession,” said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. “You’re talking about full-time drivers — this is their only bread and butter.” 
Through an app, passengers can already reserve rides on more than 2,000 driverless cars in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, with Waymo saying its vehicles have racked up more than 100 million fully autonomous miles in those five cities. Expansion is planned for next year in Miami, Dallas, Denver and Washington, D.C.
While a full New York rollout is unlikely to happen in short order, Waymo has been trying to make political inroads on cracking the biggest city in the country. 
Records show that the company’s lobbying targets have included city Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, multiple City Council members, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Manhattan Borough President and comptroller-elect Mark Levine and former Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, who previously served as head of the TLC.
Adams and Rodriguez signed off in August on the city’s first-ever permit for testing autonomous vehicles. It cleared Waymo for all-hours testing of eight of its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles through the end of this month, but requires a “trained safety specialist” behind the wheel at all times.
The tech company would need to reapply to the permit program in order to extend or expand its testing, which New Yorkers have been chronicling online through sightings of the Jaguars equipped with the technology already in use elsewhere. 
“We know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century,” Adams said in August. “As we continue to implement responsible innovation, we will always prioritize street safety.”
Riding Out
The Aug. 22 approval of Waymo’s permit application by a mayor who is running for re-election and struggling to survive politically caught some elected officials off guard.
“It kind of felt like, with the mayor sort of on his way out, sort of pulling random stuff out of a junk drawer and saying, ‘Hey, we never did this,’” said Councilmember Justin Brannan (D-Brooklyn), who co-sponsored a 2021 bill that would have required the TLC to establish rules regulating the use of autonomous vehicles as taxis.
The proposal — which also would have regulated licensing, safety, vehicle standards, insurance and trip and fare reporting — went nowhere.
City Comptroller Brad Lander, who co-sponsored that bill while serving in the City Council, said the legislation was designed, in part, to avoid a repeat of what happened more than a decade ago, when Uber’s arrival in New York upended the city’s yellow taxi industry and sunk the value of the taxi medallion.
“It’s unfortunate that a law did not get passed in advance of Waymo’s pilot that would have provided a framework for the considerations that the city needs to make about the arrival of autonomous for-hire vehicles or taxis,” Lander told THE CITY. “Having gone through the Uber process, we have the ability to foresee this and work to set the public policy considerations and rules on the city’s terms, rather than a private company’s terms.”
Desai said the early days of self-driving vehicles in New York bear more than a passing resemblance to Uber’s arrival in the city.
“Waymo is using the same tech-finance playbook of trying to dominate politically so they can monopolize financially,” she said.
But the city’s densely packed streets would offer a new type of challenge for self-driving vehicles.
“Autonomous vehicles right now might work in more suburban cities,” Brannan said. “But here, you’ve got pedestrians, and cyclists, and delivery workers and emergency vehicles and people just running in the street. 
“The margin for error is less than razor thin.”
Waymo, which began as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, says it’s taking the steps necessary to safely offer fully autonomous vehicle service on streets where the competition for space can be tough.
“While New York City would certainly be the most densely populated city Waymo has tackled in the U.S., the Waymo Driver already confronts and capably navigates many challenges associated with density — including different types of road users, jaywalking pedestrians, traffic and emergency vehicles — in five major U.S. cities,” Teicher said. 
The fate of autonomous cars in New York City may fall to the next mayoral administration. Frontrunners Zohran Mamdani — a Queens Assemblymember and the Democratic nominee — and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, may come at self-driving cars from different angles.
Mamdani has previously aligned himself with taxi workers, participating in their 2021 hunger strike over crushing medallion debt. Mamdani’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Cuomo, as governor, pushed to bring autonomous vehicles to New York, announcing in 2017 that they would be tested in Manhattan (then-Mayor Bill de Blasio was not on board). Cuomo’s successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, took a 2017 test ride in Albany while she was lieutenant governor. Cuomo’s campaign declined to comment.
The outcome of the mayoral election sets the stage for advancing a technology that’s likely to further upend how many New Yorkers move.
“That’s the big question,” Desai said. “Just because Adams gives this a final hour, desperate, green light does not mean the next administration cannot stop it and wait to formulate a thoughtful policy on how to address such a massive economic change.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25234695368876-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 12:58:28.823025

(Candidate photo courtesy of Hutcherson campaign | School bus photo by Rebecca Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A former school board president for Omaha Public Schools announced her bid Tuesday for an open seat on the Nebraska State Board of Education.
Lou Ann Goding, who served on the OPS board between 2013 and 2020, including as president in 2015 and 2016, said her statewide service would mirror her local service. Goding said she championed student achievement, increased teacher pay, safeguarded tax dollars and prioritized school safety for OPS. Goding ran for the Legislature in 2022.
In a Tuesday campaign announcement, Goding said she is running “to bring proven leadership and a results-driven approach to improving education for all Nebraska students.”

Goding noted Nebraska had an 88% high school graduation rate in the 2023-24 school year, yet 42% of high school juniors statewide tested as proficient in math and 45% of high school juniors tested as proficient in reading. The State Board of Education has prioritized those foundational skills, particularly literacy, with a goal to improve third-grade literacy rates to 75% by 2030.
“I will fight to close this ‘graduation vs. proficiency gap’ — to ensure our students aren’t just graduating with a piece of paper, but with the math, reading and critical thinking skills they will need for life and careers beyond the classroom,” Goding said in a statement.
District 8 on the State Board of Education covers central Douglas County. Incumbent Deb Neary, board vice president, has announced that she will not seek a third four-year term.
Goding, a native of Loup City and an Omaha resident since 1986, said she has five priorities for her campaign — success, safety, skills, support and stewardship — with multiple goals:

Improve student achievement through rigorous academic standards that better prepare students for careers after graduation.
Prioritize school safety with appropriate security systems and personnel and increased access to school psychologists.
Increase student proficiency in math and reading, ensure students are ready for the next grade level and highlight career and technical education.
Ensure teachers have the resources and support needed to successfully educate students.
Safeguard tax dollars, increase transparency and protect parental rights in education.

With uncertainty over what will happen to the U.S. Department of Education and possibly diverting tax dollars to states, Goding told the Nebraska Examiner that her background in financial consulting could be beneficial on the State Board of Education.

While on the OPS board, Goding said the board implemented a tool to allow constituents to better review and analyze the district’s budget and see how money is spent. 
Her OPS tenure also coincided with the Legislature’s 2019 approval of transferring management of a retirement system specific to Omaha school employees to the state. The state oversees retirement for all other schools, state employees and more.
Goding testified in favor of the legislation from former State Sen. Mark Kolterman of Seward, who had been chair of the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee and led the legislation following reporting about mismanagement in the OPS account. Kolterman is among those endorsing Goding’s 2026 campaign.
“I think that sets me up to be able to effectively look at and help guide and direct the funding which will be most effectively supporting our students and teachers and ultimately the taxpayer,” Goding told the Examiner.
Other early endorsements for Goding include U.S. Sens. Pete Ricketts and Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; former Gov. Dave Heineman; Attorney General Mike Hilgers; Omaha State Sens. Kathleen Kauth and Christy Armendariz and current State Board of Education member Lisa Schonhoff.
Goding joins the officially nonpartisan race for the education board with Sherrye Hutcherson, an executive vice president of Bellevue University.
The State Board of Education is currently split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats. Neary is a registered Democrat and won a close reelection in 2022 against a conservative challenger. Goding is a registered Republican. Hutcherson is a registered nonpartisan. 
During Goding’s tenure on the OPS board, she said she also helped the district work on a strategic plan that set students and teachers up for success. The board’s work included a specialized program at a North Omaha elementary school that mirrored a program in Atlanta to replace one section of a student’s “special” courses — such as for music or art — with a small group session for students struggling with core skills.
Goding said she recalls a young boy struggling in math who asked his teacher what would happen if he passed his math test, which would allow him to go to art in addition to his music course. However, he purposefully failed the test because he enjoyed the extra support.
A successful four years in office, Goding said, would mean improved test scores through long-term and lasting strategies. She said this focus could mean keeping a student in a grade level for another year to give them extra support.
“When you implement with consistency and you allow your staff to do what’s best for the students in the building, then you actually see success,” Goding said.
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 election.

Bocicaut remembers seeing the utter devastation of the attacks, and helped distribute body bags. He also remembers seeing a fog, but he later found out it was something else.
“A lot of people who were there day in and day out for several days, might have been affected health-wise by the dust, all the carcinogens that were flying in the air,” Bocicaut said. “We didn’t know what they were.”
Thousands of people who participated in the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York ended up suffering from health complications as a result. After years of advocacy, they finally received federal funding to help with health care costs and other benefits.
The Trump administration’s attempts at scaling back programs associated with those benefits were quickly reversed after outcry from advocates and politicians from the tri-state area.
However, some still worry about the availability of future access to these programs.
Bocicaut did not participate in these programs and did not get sick. But he is an advocate for those who did. He said providing for those volunteers and rescue workers should not be up for debate.
“I think we should take care of them, the country has an obligation to take care of them,” Bocicaut said.
The World Trade Center Health Program was one of several programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) impacted by broader federal staffing cuts earlier this year.
The cuts were reversed after outcry from victims’ families and advocates. Connecticut State Rep. Bill Heffernan, a Democrat, said lawmakers are continuing to keep a watchful eye on the program.
Heffernan was also a firefighter at the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center, known at the time as The Pile. He was later diagnosed with cancer, but isn’t sure if his time spent at the site contributed to his diagnosis.
While the programs now enjoy broad political support, Heffernan remembers how much work went into getting those benefits in the first place.
Heffernan said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) supported the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. It was named after a New York City Police Department officer who is considered the first NYPD death confirmed to be linked to the recovery efforts.
The funding for the health care ended up getting extended in 2015 until the year 2090. But while the program is not at risk, any risk accessing that care needs to be closely watched, Heffernan said.
“I know that everyone threatens things now, this is going to be cut, that’s going to be cut, and we’re on the ball,” Heffernan said. “We’re keeping an eye on it. So I want to make sure that those benefits don’t go anywhere.”
Connecticut State Sen. Tony Hwang, a Republican who represents Fairfield, was among those who honored 9/11 victims at the state’s annual remembrance ceremony at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport Thursday. While speaking at the event, Hwang defended the benefits for 9/11 first responders.
“God bless all of those that have been adversely impacted by a senseless and terrible tragedy, and let us make sure that we protect and ensure their health and safety into the future year,” Hwang said. “It is our obligation as a society to ensure that we do that.”
Blumenthal’s son, State Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Democrat who represents Stamford, said access to the programs have never had a guaranteed future. And while the programs are safe, any impact to them should be defended against, underscoring how raw the attacks remain on the tri-state area.
“It’s vital that we continue to preserve them, to make sure that everyone who sacrificed that day is taken care of, and that their sacrifice was not in vain,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/911-first-responders-CTPublic-1024x683.webp,,,2025-09-09 11:58:41.804302

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Lawmakers will be back in Tallahassee next month to convene committee hearings. Among those committees will be the new House Select committee on Congressional Redistricting.
Rep. Mike Redondo, first elected in 2023 to represent part of Miami-Dade County, will chair the 11-person committee.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month that the committee would convene. The Senate lacks a similar panel.
Florida House creating a committee on congressional redistricting

“Exploring” questions related to redistricting, Perez said last month, “would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our Supreme Court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.”
A spokesperson for Senate President Ben Albritton told the Phoenix Tuesday that the Senate had no updates about whether the Senate would convene a committee on congressional redistricting.
The questions Perez referred to are the “applicability and interpretation of certain provisions of the so-called ‘Fair Districts’ provisions of the Florida Constitution and their intersection with Federal law.”
The Fair District provisions in the Florida Constitution won voter approval in 2010 and is intended to block the Legislature from designing districts to benefit any political party or incumbent. They’re also intended to protect minority representation.
As previously reported by the Phoenix, congressional redistricting was not in conversation during the previous legislative session; however, national conversations have brought it into the spotlight as President Donald Trump called for a mid-decade census.
Florida claims to have been “egregiously undercounted” during the last Census, and Texas has already redistricted.
“The decision to launch a mid-decade drawing of congressional maps is unnecessary and expensive. This is a backroom power grab from Republican politicians,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a written statement following the release of the the committee members.
“Voters didn’t ask for this. Instead of tackling the affordability crisis Floridians are facing every day, Republican leadership is trying to protect their congressional Republicans from the fall out of the Big Ugly Bill. Florida Democrats will continue to fight for fair representation and ensure Floridians’ voices are not silenced at the ballot box,” Fried continued.
Also on the committee are Republican Reps. Jessica Baker, Kim Berfield, Nan Cobb, Peggy Gossett-Seidman, Patt Maney, Jenna Persons-Mulicka, and Will Robinson. Reps. Bruce Antone, Kevin Chambliss, and Johanna López are the Democrats on the committee.
Perez announced the panel alongside other committee assignments for the session that will start in January, including some changing chairships.
Perez previously said that no representatives who have expressed interest in running for Congress would be placed on the committee.
He added that while representatives are free to express their opinions on the issue, “statements about redistricting that suggest an intent to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party, which is currently prohibited by the Florida Constitution, will also disqualify you from consideration.”

(USDA photo by Bob Nichols)South Dakota is at the epicenter of this fall’s bird flu season with a total of 134,900 turkeys at three facilities already killed to contain the spread, and reports coming in about thousands more. 
The only other state reporting confirmed infections in commercial flocks during the last 30 days is North Dakota, where 60,300 turkeys have been killed in response, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Detections this early in the season are troubling, according to Beth Thompson, South Dakota’s state veterinarian. The peak avian influenza seasons typically coincide with the fall and spring migration of wild birds, which can carry the virus without becoming sick. The spread of bird flu before those migrations begin is concerning.
“I have not seen any information so far that major wild bird migrations have started,” Thompson said. “That is not a good sign.”
The season’s first infection in South Dakota was confirmed Aug. 28 in Faulk County, where 55,400 turkeys had to be killed, followed by a Sept. 2 case in Beadle County where 52,600 birds were put down. The third was in McPherson County, causing 26,900 birds to be killed. 
Thompson said that puts South Dakota at the “leading edge” of this season’s infections, with further cases already being investigated.
The bird flu depopulation process is federally mandated and involves killing all birds at affected sites to prevent the virus from spreading to nearby farms. Thompson said “foaming” is the most common method in turkey barns, where foam is sprayed atop turkeys inside the barn to suffocate them. 
She said federal law requires producers to carry out the depopulation process with assistance from federal and state officials who oversee the work, with the federal government covering losses through indemnity payments. Those payments have totaled more than $1 billion nationally since 2020, according to analysis by CBS News, including about $130 million in South Dakota.
Thompson emphasized that poultry products remain safe to eat. 
“Chicken, turkey, eggs — all of those products go through a rigorous food safety protocol,” she said. “The public should be completely confident in their food supply.”
Thompson said backyard flock owners are urged to work with veterinarians and report any sudden bird deaths.

(Courtesy Indiana Innocence Project)The Indiana Innocence Project has joined an international network of groups that provide pro bono legal and investigative services to wrongfully convicted people, and support them once they’re free.
“The (project) is proud to join the best organizations in the world leading the fight for justice,” the organization’s board president, Fran Watson, said in a Monday news release. “Becoming the 74th member of the Innocence Network is a milestone for the Indiana Innocence Project.”
Indiana has paid out $1 million in restitution to eight wrongfully incarcerated people

The project was founded in August last year, “out of the legacy” of the Wrongful Conviction Clinic at the Indiana University McKinney School of Law, according to the release.
It began operations with three pending cases and has since accepted two more, with four of the five clients serving life sentences for murder. The group has seven board members — including Hoosier exonerees Kristine Bunch and Roosevelt Glenn — and three staff members.
“We are thrilled to announce the INIP as the newest member of the Network,” said Meredith Kennedy, director of the Innocence Network’s Support Unit. “Since its founding in 2024, the INIP has rapidly mobilized to secure justice for Hoosiers who have been wrongfully imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. We look forward to working together to champion policies and legislative reforms aimed at preventing and rectifying wrongful convictions in Indiana.”
As a new member, the project will collaborate with other member organizations, get capacity-building assistance, and contribute to the network’s collective efforts and strategic direction. It’s the second group from Indiana to join, after the Notre Dame Exoneration Justice Clinic.
Since 2005, Innocence Network members have collectively exonerated more than 850 people, according to the release. They operate across the nation and in a dozen other countries.

That’s not a joke.""","Editor’s note: This Mississippi Today Ideas essay is published as part of our Brain Drain project, which seeks answers to why Mississippians move out of state. To read more about the project, click here.

Growing up in Jackson, I had it good. My walk to school, Jackson Academy, was less than half a mile and if I wasn’t asleep or out with my friends, I was at school. I did show choir, sports broadcasting, tutored kids and spent a great deal of time studying.
I didn’t understand it at the time, but what made my formative years so great was my autonomy. I could stay at the school working a broadcast or rehearsal until 10 p.m., walk home and go to bed without a second thought.
Moving away to study civil engineering, I realized that most of my peers didn’t grow up with the level of autonomy that I enjoyed, and that played a big role in the passion I have for civil engineering. So far, I’ve learned a lot more than I bargained for, but it opened the door to understanding the broader complex system of infrastructure that connects and builds our communities.
After the elections this year, it was clear to me that Jackson is ready to do whatever it takes, and doing infrastructure right is crucial to setting the city up for success.
I believe downtown Jackson is key to creating that success.
Downtown Jackson is the most financially successful region of the city. That’s not a joke. As a civil engineering student well into my degree at Mississippi State, I have seen the latest developments in urban design.
In the context of Jackson, one company, North Carolina-based Urban 3, has stood out. Urban 3 helps cities by creating a comprehensive analysis of a city’s expenses and revenues.

Lafayette, Louisiana, is my favorite city to compare to Jackson. It’s a Southern city with rich history and culture. It has a population, suburban makeup and types of developments similar to Jackson’s.
Urban 3’s study of Lafayette found that the urban core generated the most in property taxes, enough to effectively subsidize properties and projects outside of the urban core. The rest of the city brought in roughly net zero or lost the city money. 
While Jackson has not been evaluated by Urban 3, every other city and town that has been evaluated has seen the same outcome. The densest urban parts of a community routinely bring in far more in tax revenue than they cost in infrastructure maintenance, policing, libraries, etc.
Jackson already has the buildings in place, but many of these buildings have no tenants or only partial occupancy. That is unacceptable. Downtown is the economic engine behind every community, and Jackson needs to repopulate its downtown to stand a chance at helping the rest of the city flourish.
Fortunately, the tools already exist to accomplish that goal. They just have to be used.
The first step is the most cost effective. I suggest updating downtown’s zoning codes to form-based codes (FBCs). FBCs do away with deciding which lot will be residential, commercial, etc.
Instead, FBCs establish a uniform look for a specified area. For example, an FBC may require building setbacks, height maximums and 50% of the first floor be commercial, hence FBCs are often more forgiving than traditional zoning codes.
Additionally, FBCs give property owners the power of the free market to decide how to best use their property; whether it be a grocery store, a law office or a furniture shop. This does not mean that all regulations should be abandoned, but you shouldn’t have to go through the lengthy process of rezoning the whole property for every new use.
The second step is the toughest to implement. I suggest that the city take a hard look at which properties still warrant new infrastructure spending.The city has lost thousands of residents since its peak population, and some neighborhoods simply do not have the number of residents to justify new roads or utilities.
Jackson is currently overbuilt, and the city needs to put what money it does have into investments that have the best odds of stabilizing the city.
If Jackson does not take care of the areas that can and currently do bring in net positive tax revenue for the city, then there is no chance for the rest of the city. Only by obsessively maintaining the infrastructure, utilities and public services for downtown will the city set up its golden goose with the best odds for success.
The third step is the most costly, but proven. Downtown should be designed at a human scale. To do that, streets must be built around people and their safety first. In the context of civil engineering, many experts put our roadways into one of two buckets.
The first bucket is labeled “roads.” Roads should be used to get you from point A to point B as fast as possible. Therefore, it would be absurd to build a Walmart with direct access to I-55 because of the danger of entering and exiting, not to mention the slow down of traffic along the interstate.
In the other bucket there are “streets.” Streets should be used to connect a storefront to its customers, building community wealth. Like the Walmart on I-55, it would be an equally bad idea to let drivers fly down the street with no way to slow them down.
Unfortunately, many of our roadways look like something in between the street and the road I just described, neither moving people efficiently nor building community wealth.
If you sit down for just a few minutes along West, State or Pascagoula streets, you will see cars flying down the road in what is supposed to be a downtown. Downtown can not be a safe and comfortable space for people of all ages when cars essentially have a drag strip to go as fast as they please.
Fortunately, the city has shown that it knows how to reorient these overgrown streets as proven on East Capitol Street. One lane was removed, roundabouts were built and sidewalks given more separation from traffic.
To prove my point, walk down Capitol Street and then walk down any of the three aforementioned streets. The difference is night and day.
Regardless of everything that can and will be done, some businesses and residents will still choose to leave. That is OK, because others will see the success of downtown and choose to move in, not because it will happen, but because it is already happening. Remo’s, Aladdin and Mayflower are all great new additions.
If this city values long term fiscal stability and strong community, it will capitalize on the wealth it has today instead of squandering what is left.

Sept. 9, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceThe Michigan Republican electors for Donald Trump in 2020, who were accused of fraud and attempting to assist the Trump campaign in overturning the year’s election results, will not face trial, a Lansing district court judge ruled today.
The ruling from Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons on Tuesday received praise from supporters of the 15 defendants, who rallied outside the courthouse in downtown Lansing on Tuesday, and troubled Attorney General Dana Nessel, who warned of a slippery slope for American democracy now that the charges were dismissed.
Simmons, in a decision from the bench, concluded there wasn’t sufficient evidence to prove that the 15 individuals, charged with a host of forgery and conspiracy crimes, had criminal intent when they allegedly signed documents certifying Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump. 
That led Simmons to dismiss the charges and she did not order the cadre to be bound over for trial. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the attorney general’s office retains the right to appeal Simmons’ decision, Nessel said her office is reviewing the matter and that they would be making that decision at a later time.
The defendants included Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock, Hank Choate, Amy Facchinello, Clifford Frost, Stanley Grot, John Haggard, Mary-Ann Henry, Timothy King, Michele Lundgren, Mayra Rodriguez, Rose Rook, Marian Sheridan, Kenneth Thompson and Kent Vanderwood.
While a 16th individual, James Renner, initially faced eight felony charges, Renner reached a cooperation agreement with the attorney general’s office, which led to the charges being dropped. He later served as a key witness for state prosecutors.
Simmons recounted Renner’s testimony, when he told the court the group did not intend to commit fraud or forgery during the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting in the basement of the Michigan Republican Party headquarters where they signed the documents.

“Renner testified that they were told that this was an appropriate process, by the leaders and attorneys that were present at the meeting,” Simmons told the courtroom, noting additional testimony where Renner said he would not have attended the meeting if he believed a crime was being committed.
While the attorney general’s office called several witnesses, Simmons said their testimony largely aligned with Renner’s later on, noting that reliance on advice from attorneys tends to refute the government’s ability to prove intent. 
Following Simmons’ decision, John Freeman, who represented Sheridan, told reporters that Simmons’ decision was in line with what the defense had been arguing since the beginning of the case. 
Sheridan said she was overwhelmingly happy with the judge’s decision, but that she was frustrated the charges had gone this far. 
“This should have never happened. This was clearly malicious prosecution,” Sheridan said.
Choate offered similar sentiments, telling reporters that as a dairy farmer, he never expected to be sitting in a courtroom facing criminal charges. 
“We stood solid, demonstrated courage,” Choate said. “We felt and knew in our hearts that we were right in what we wanted to do, and no way were we going to bow down to political persecution or political intimidation.”
Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad also cheered Simmons’ decision while accusing Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel – a Democrat who has been a fierce opponent of President Donald Trump, leading or joining more than 30 cases against his administration – of weaponizing her office against her political opponents.
“Today, Judge Kristen Simmons restored the public’s faith in our justice system. All 2020 Trump Electors have officially been vindicated,” Runestad said in a statement.

Nessel warns of ruling’s potential damage to American democracy
Nessel spoke with reporters in a virtual news conference following the ruling. Although Simmons emphasized the complexity of the case, as demonstrated by the lengthy preliminary examination and the amount of evidence reviewed, Nessel argued the case is quite simple.
“The evidence was clear. They lied,” Nessel asked. “They knew they lied, and they tried to steal the votes of millions of Michiganders. And if they can get away with this, well, what can’t they get away with next?”
She shared further concerns about the bearing this case would have on upcoming elections and American Democracy as a whole. Nessel also raised concerns about fear of retaliation and intimidation of judges handling cases concerning the president. 
“This is the most dangerous slippery slope that exists for American democracy: When the courts determine that violations of election law should not even be heard by a jury; when state legislators and governors across America make it easier for Trump to cheat; when the Supreme Court hands the president a blank check to violate any law, commit any crime without penalty or consequence,” Nessel said.
As the state moves into another election year, Nessel said she is worried that the damage to the American election system has already been done.
“I am terrified for the 2026 elections, and not because I’m worried somebody I support will lose,” Nessel said. “I’m worried that President Trump and his aiders and abettors and followers have already ensured that no future American election will ever really be fair or free.”

Running out of time to complete a learning unit on math fractions, Concord Elementary third grade teacher Brianne Sinden turned to her “team” of fellow second and third grade teachers.
Second grade teacher Becca Bradley offered to help out with an intervention time that divided the lesson in half, allowing Bradley’s second graders to participate in the lesson and benefit, as well.
“For 22 years, I’ve always felt like I’ve been stuck in this room, and it’s all on me,” Sinden said. “I mean, I can do a lot of things, but I can’t do it all well. So, I feel like teaming with second grade, it’s just opened up so many opportunities, and their ideas have been great.”
The small rural school district of 617 students in Jackson County is one of two schools in Michigan starting its second year of a “team teaching” pilot that moves away from a traditional “one teacher, one room” model and assigns a group of teachers, aides and other staff to an entire set of students, sometimes combining multiple grades.
While the team teaching model is intended to look different depending on the needs of the school, students typically learn from multiple teachers a day, sometimes with multiple teachers or educators in the room at the same time.
At Concord, time is set aside for daily breakout math and reading group instruction in the lower grade levels. During these lessons, younger students are blended with different grades, while older students in grades 8 to 10 participate in cross-curricular learning units teaching teams have devised. For instance, eighth grade students combined their studies on science-based environmental policy with math to demonstrate the pros and cons of the policy.

About 100 miles to the east in downtown Detroit, team teaching has helped the staff of the Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences focus on their strengths, assigning each of its teachers in kindergarten and second grade to a specific group of students for their phonics work.
Early returns on team teaching are positive at the K-8 charter school, with data showing improved scores in math for second graders who were a part of the pilot this past fall, Chief Academic Officer Monica McLeod said.
Like several of the schools nationwide that have adopted the team teaching model during its recent reemergence, McLeod cited two concurrent objectives: To attract and retain talented teachers and to make the profession more sustainable and connected by giving teachers more ownership over student learning.
“It pushed all of us to lean into our strengths and our trust and belief in each other,” McLeod said.
 Created a shared responsibility

The team teaching model was introduced in Michigan last fall through the Michigan Educator Workforce Initiative, a nonprofit that designs, funds and supports programs to recruit, develop and retain teachers. The initiative partnered with Arizona State University’s Next Education Workforce, which trains teachers on strategic staffing models and helps schools develop staffing models that work for their students.
With Michigan teachers leaving the profession at higher rates, MEWI CEO Jack Elsey said team teaching is one of several initiatives his organization has taken on in recent years in its comprehensive view of the educator pipeline.
With three more Michigan school districts debuting the staffing models this fall and 12 schools implementing strategic staffing statewide, Elsey said there is cautious optimism that team teaching could present benefits for both teacher retention and student achievement.
“I think overall, teachers feel better supported by their colleagues because they’re in the same physical space with them,” he said. “They can talk about those kids among people who know those kids just as well as they do and they can say, ‘You know, I’m really struggling with delivering this math lesson, can you deliver this math lesson to my kids today?’ because I think you do it in a better way.”
For Concord, participating in the pilot made sense with more than half of the district’s teachers becoming eligible for retirement in the next few years, Superintendent Rebecca Hutchinson said.
Teachers have reported that the pilot has helped them get to know their students on a deeper level and dive deeper into the core curriculum, Hutchinson said. It’s also helped teachers lean into their strengths, while allowing them more planning time and collaboration with members of their teams, Hutchinson said.
“It creates this distributed expertise, but also this shared responsibility,” said Hutchinson, who is in her 18th year with the district, including the past six as superintendent. “It’s not just about who’s in front of me and what’s in front of me right now.”
 Elevating the teaching profession

Foundationally, ASU has a “no one model” philosophy behind Next Education Workforce’s role in helping redesign teaching models, allowing for a distribution of expertise with the intention of deeper, personalized learning for students.
In Mesa Public Schools, the largest public district in Arizona, Next Education Workforce Executive Director Brent Maddin says there is evidence that teachers working in teams are more likely to remain in their district than their colleagues in traditional classroom models.
Mesa also has seen correlational data show teachers in team models are more effective than their colleagues in traditional classrooms and are happier and more engaged in their work, Maddin said.
“Our work, in particular, is largely focused on the educators and creating the conditions for them to thrive and to do their work differently,” Maddin said. “We’re not coming in with a particular ‘one size fits all’ approach. Instead, whatever the staffing model ultimately becomes is co-constructed by the educators in the communities in which the model is being implemented.”
Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences decided to start slowly, with just kindergarten and second grade teachers agreeing to participate in its first year.
Teachers were instrumental in both designing and tweaking the model early in the year, switching morning small group meetings focused on social-emotional learning to daily themes like “Motivational Monday” and “Talk about it Tuesday.” While students saw each of the grade’s five teachers every day for different subjects, they were assigned to a home room teacher and a classroom that was designated with the name of a fruit.
Toward the end of the year, second grade teachers gave team teaching the ultimate endorsement in a Power Point presentation to administrators and third grade teachers explaining why the model should follow their students into the next grade. The school kicked off the academic year expanding the pilot to third and sixth grades this fall.
“It was amazing,” second grade teacher Lindsay Solomon said. “I could stand up there and teach, and my co-teacher could go around and support scholars. Even if there was a behavior issue, she could quietly put that fire out without me ever having to stop teaching.”
Second grade teacher Tayla Watson described the relationship she had with team co-teacher Broyles as complementary, with each other’s strengths helping in areas where the other might struggle. With five grade-level teachers sharing a roster of 115 students, it also allowed the teaching staff to more easily cover for each other when there were absences, Watson said, resulting in fewer interruptions to student learning.
“I think we have a lot more trust from our administrators and our leaders, because we are united and working together,” Watson said. “I think that that is something that could really elevate the teaching profession.”
 No one model

At Concord, team teaching looks different in every grade. Children in second and third grades are combined and assigned a homeroom teacher who acts in a role similar to their classroom teacher. In fourth and fifth grades, students also are combined, but there are two teachers in the room at the same time. In higher grade levels, teachers come in for 30 minute subject “rotations” for each of the four core classes.
As an eighth grade teacher last year, Kayla Taylor could co-teach the humanities, with Taylor leading the way and another teacher providing additional oversight and support.
A student teacher was added in the second semester, bringing a third educator to the mix that allowed for more small group learning. This year, Taylor will teach ninth and 10th grades, with different weekly planning days on the schedule for both grades. Despite more planning between teachers to make it happen, Taylor said the model was effective in making a better use of students’ time.

“Even though the schedule was more traditional, we were able to do more in terms of stations or kind of differentiating the instruction depending on individual student needs,” Taylor said. “That wasn’t necessarily just the students with IEPs or 504 (plans) but also the advanced students and the students in the center, to ensure that everyone was continuing to make progress.”
Hutchinson said there have been early signs of success, with both eighth and ninth grades reducing the number of students failing or needing to recover credits.
With the district expanding team teaching to 10th grade this year, Hutchinson said each grade level continues to map out its own plan for its newest set of students, with shared goals around cross-curricular collaboration, “deeper” learning and building communication and reasoning.
“When you feel like you have a high sense of collective efficacy around the success of kids, it’s rewarding when you can sit down and make a plan and put that plan into action and that kid will succeed,” she said. “That’s the ultimate gift.”

Alongside him were attorneys general Kris Kobach of Kansas, Liz Murrill of Louisiana, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, and then-attorney general of Alaska, Treg Taylor.
The attorneys general said they are also concerned by lawsuits from states and local governments that could result in financial penalties against fossil fuel companies for disasters attributed to climate change.
Vermont made history in 2024 when it enacted a law that allows the state to hold fossil fuel companies financially liable for the negative impacts of climate change on that state. New York followed suit with a similar law later in the year. 
Under both laws, fines levied by the states and paid by fossil fuel companies would go into a large fund that would be spent on projects that could mitigate natural disasters or subsidize clean energy projects.
Other Democratic-led states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey and California, are considering similar laws.
“Now that we have a friendly EPA and a friendly administration, the blue states are deciding that they’re now going to be the EPA,” McCuskey said, speaking at a different panel hosted by the Republican Women of Anchorage. 
The attorneys general, plus Ken Paxton of Texas, who was not present at the industry panel, nodded along as McCuskey spoke.
“Their argument is that every single permitted operation that happened in Alaska caused $75 billion worth of damage to the people of New York. It’s completely outrageous. And the problem isn’t just that it’s New York, it’s that Illinois has one. California is going to have one. Vermont’s going to have one. Massachusetts is going to have one. You name a place that has radical environmentalists running their government, and then it becomes an amount of money that’s not withstandable,” McCuskey said.
Taylor, who has since resigned as Alaska’s attorney general and is expected to run for governor, said he believes that in states with budget holes, “it’s pretty convenient just to raise taxes on oil and gas, right? And those states that don’t have oil and gas, that’s their way of dealing with their budget shortfalls, is to take it out of oil and gas through these types of acts.”

Fossil fuel businesses and trade groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed suit last year against the Vermont law. 
A group of Republican attorneys general, led by McCuskey, sued New York in February. Another McCuskey-led suit, filed in May, targets Vermont. 
The Trump administration has also gotten involved by filing lawsuits against both states and against states like Hawaii that have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.
Those suits say companies should be financially liable for harm caused by climate change.
Speaking at the Alaska oil panel, Kobach said he’s concerned about climate lawsuits filed by cities and counties and believes they’re being encouraged by national environmental law firms and groups.
“The reason I’m so energized about fighting back against that is Ford County, Kansas, which you probably never heard of, where Dodge City is — little tiny county, rural county, very low population — somehow, they were convinced by some very well-heeled attorneys in California to be a plaintiff in one of these lawsuits. And so we’re chasing them around. My office is chasing them around, trying to get them kicked out of court because they don’t speak for the people of Kansas,” he said.
Taylor said he sees the same issue.
“We’re seeing those opportunistic plaintiffs’ attorneys convince municipalities and boroughs and cities to take on litigation that’s really not in their best interest and really puts money into their own pockets,” he said during the panel discussion.
McCuskey, of West Virginia, said his state is considering a law that would restrict the ability of local governments to sue.
Nationally, the fossil fuel industry is lobbying Congress to pass a liability shield law akin to the one passed in 2005 to protect the gun industry against lawsuits attempting to hold gun manufacturers responsible for gun crimes. 
In June, McCuskey and other attorneys general wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney General to offer support for a national liability shield to protect fossil fuel companies. 
The National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities have each adopted resolutions opposing such a liability shield. Both organizations say that local governments should retain the power to file lawsuits.
McCuskey, speaking at the oil panel, got a laugh from the audience when he asked attendees what they thought West Virginians would say if New York tried to collect a fine from the state of West Virginia.
“Our big joke is that the people in New York are literally looking down on us from the skyscrapers that were built with coal from West Virginia,” McCuskey said at the oil and gas association panel. “So they’re not just looking down on us figuratively, but both literally and figuratively, and they just have no contemplation of why their economies were built by the people who do the work that’s happening here.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250828-attorneys-general-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-09 10:58:45.878488

Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. In a fiery resignation letter, Daskalakis wrote that “The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people.”
Minnesota joins Colorado, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York and Pennsylvania, which have issued similar orders after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it would be limiting the COVID-19 vaccine to people over 65 or with an underlying health condition.
The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington have formed a health alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations independent of federal decisions, and states in the northeast are considering following suit.
The Massachusetts commissioners of insurance and public health announced last week that Massachusetts health insurers must cover vaccines recommended by the state regardless of federal policy.
Walz’s order is slightly less aggressive, setting deadlines for the health and commerce departments to take care of legalities and logistics. Minnesotans can expect a standing order from the health department’s medical director on COVID-19 vaccine access within the next two weeks. By Oct. 6, the departments will need to convene health insurers and providers to come up with a plan to address barriers to vaccine access.
According to a press release announcing the order, pharmacists in Minnesota can administer COVID-19 vaccines regardless of recommendations from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was overhauled and whose members were replaced largely with vaccine skeptics by Kennedy in June.
But it’s unclear whether insurers will continue to cover the costs of vaccines not recommended by ACIP, especially since Minnesota law defines which immunizations insurers must provide under preventive care based on the advisory committee’s recommendations. Already, some Minnesotans have had trouble getting the latest COVID-19 vaccine to be covered by their insurance, the Star Tribune reported.
The order also directs MDH to monitor whether similar measures will need to be taken for other vaccines.
On Sept. 18 and 19, in addition to the COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP will discuss and possibly vote on recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine; measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine; and respiratory syncytial virus vaccine.

But one school has found a way around that. Instead of applying through fast-track replication, Triangle Math and Science Academy (TMSA) sought approval to open a “sub campus,” a designation some charter networks use to add new locations under an existing charter.
The North Carolina Charter School Review Board voted in a split 6-5 decision on Monday to approve the Durham County campus, about 11 miles from TMSA’s Apex location. The new school will replicate the school’s Apex K–8 model, eventually serving about 900 students, starting with grades K–5 in August 2026.
The debate wasn’t over whether TMSA could expand. The academy has strong academic record. Its Apex and Triangle campuses hold “A” state performance grades, while the Greensboro and Charlotte schools have shown improvement. The network now serves about 6,000 students across North Carolina, with more than 5,000 on waiting lists.
But TMSA’s decision to bypass the “fast-track replication” sparked an intense debate Monday over the “sub campus” model, which some members of the state review board worried it exposed a loophole in the system, particularly if low-performing schools tried the same approach.
“I’m not sure I really like this idea of I open a sub campus in a different district, and just call it a way of expanding that requires a quick 10 slides and an executive summary and 20 minutes of deliberation,” board member Eric Sanchez said.
John Eldridge, vice chair of the charter review board, echoed similar concerns.
“I just want to make sure we’re clear on what ‘sub campus’ means, because it could be seen as avoiding the process of having to go through the application process for a new school,” said Eldridge. “If that’s the case, and that’s how things move forward, then we have to be careful about what standards are in place for what sub campus means, so that we don’t open up a can of worms.”
But some board members praised the subcampus option and see it as a creative and  practical path for high performing charter schools weighed down by what they see as North Carolina’s lengthy application process, which can take months to complete.
“I am extremely in favor of this kind of category, especially with schools that … have an excellent track record,”board member Lindalyn Kakadelis said. “The application process can run [hundreds] of pages. If we want the charter school movement to expand in North Carolina, we need options like a sub campus.
Ashley Baquero, executive director of the state Office of Charter Schools, said concerns about low-performing schools using the “sub campus” model as a loophole are unlikely to materialize because such expansions still require approval from the Charter School Review Board.
“It’s unlikely the board would approve a sub campus for a low-performing school, just as in the past they have denied expansion requests for low-performing schools,” Baquero said.
But she noted that a different provision of state law could allow low-performing schools to move within a 10-mile radius without any oversight. “Because the law now allows a school to move up to 10 miles with no approval from the board or our office, hypothetically you could have a low-performing school move and have no control over that,” she said.
The board indicated it will form a subcommittee to establish clearer criteria for future sub campus requests.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_CharterSchool.jpg,,,2025-09-09 09:56:16.994865

Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to “continue fighting” after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted restrictions on immigration raids in Los Angeles, but the state might not have many options. 
California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged as much during a press conference Monday where he said he was disappointed in the decision but added that he respects the rule of law. 

Bonta: “The rationale articulated by Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh is dangerous and wrong. But he’s a Supreme Court justice and I’m not.”

As CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos explain, the country’s highest court handed President Donald Trump’s administration a win by lifting a restraining order that limited agents from conducting “roving patrols” and stopping people in part based on their appearance.
In addition to L.A., the ruling will likely have major impacts across the country, as immigration agents ramp up operations in Chicago, Boston and elsewhere.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, on social media: “This is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous — it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the U.S.”

While noting that California is not a party in the lawsuit, Bonta remained non-committal about the state’s options following the ruling, saying that it will monitor the dispute and potentially file an amicus brief should the involved parties respond to the court’s decision.
Meanwhile Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas hinted at possible legislative actions to push back against Trump “with everything we’ve got.” 

Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, in a statement: “We’ve already passed laws to prevent raids in our schools and hospitals. … The only way we stop Trump is by standing together.”

A federal judge issued the restraining order in July, siding with civil rights, immigrant rights and local government agencies that argued that immigration agents were violating Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
But in a 6-3 decision the Supreme Court granted the administration’s emergency request to lift that order, with the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissenting. 

Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion explaining his reasoning to lift restrictions: “Ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”


Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

CA officials honor ‘progressive warrior’ John Burton

The California Senate took a moment to honor one of its legends when it returned to business, recognizing John Burton, who died Sunday at the age of 92. 
Describing him as one of the Senate’s “finest members,” Senate president pro tem Mike Mcguire of Santa Rosa led the chamber on Monday in a moment of silence to honor the former lawmaker and California Democratic Party leader. 
Known for his brash way of speaking, Burton was a key figure in Democratic politics in California for decades. News of his passing drew multiple honors and tributes from California’s top officials, including from those whose careers were shaped by Burton, such as Gov. Newsom and Rep. Nancy Pelosi.

Newsom, in a statement: “There was no greater champion for the poor, the bullied, the disabled, and forgotten Californians than John Burton. … His legacy is not only written in the policies he helped enact, but in the countless lives he touched and uplifted, including my own.”

Newsom directed flags to be flown at half-staff, and the governor plans to posthumously induct Burton into the California Hall of Fame. In her tribute, Pelosi described Burton as a “towering progressive warrior,” while close friend and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that Burton’s influence was “immeasurable.”



School unions a maybe on sex abuse bill

California lawmakers are considering a bill that would help protect schoolchildren from being sexually abused by educators, but the measure faces opposition by some teacher’s unions, writes Matt Drange for CalMatters.
In addition to requiring training for teachers and students on how to recognize signs of sexual grooming, Senate Bill 848 would mandate district officials to report and track “egregious” instances of employee misconduct. It would also create a hiring database that administrators must use to vet prospective teachers for potential misconduct.
The database is intended to curb the practice of schools re-hiring teachers who have resigned from another school after being accused of sexual misconduct. The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, notably does not oppose the bill, despite opposing similar legislation in past years. The California Federation of Teachers and the California School Employees Association do, however, citing concerns over due process.

Tristan Brown, California Federation of Teachers’ legislative director. “We need to ensure a policy that captures individuals that are unfit to work in education while making sure innocent and unfairly charged employees have fair access to justice.”

Pedro Zacarias
Pedro Zacarias is a farmworker and an advocate in the Purepecha community.


Extreme heat is a public health emergency for millions of Californians. For my family, it isn’t just a threat outdoors; it’s within our home as well. 
I live in a mobile home in Thermal in eastern Coachella Valley. Here, triple-digit heat creeps into our forecast earlier and earlier each year. This year, 100-degree days started in April and likely won’t end until October. 
Many times this summer, we tried using swamp coolers. But when humidity penetrates our homes, it’s a suffocating feeling, especially when you lack insulation. You can’t escape it. 
I know it’s dangerous to work seven or eight hours a day under the sun and then continue to bear oppressive temperatures at home, but what choice do I have?
State leaders can do something about this and pass Senate Bill 655 for my family and the millions of Californians this bill would help protect. The measure establishes a state policy that would require residential units to maintain a safe maximum indoor temperature. If it becomes law, it would affect future state regulations, programs and grant decisions.
California already has laws in place for homes to maintain a minimum indoor temperature. Why not have a law to ensure a maximum indoor temperature too? 
Climate change will make extreme heat events longer and more severe. In the next few decades, Riverside County will see 55 days every year in which temperatures exceed 100 degrees. By 2050, deaths from extreme heat could jump to more than 10,000 per year in California.
SB 655 could save lives. Nearly half the people in the U.S. who died from heat in the past 20 years died indoors. Many had no reliable cooling in their homes. Here in California, extreme heat caused 3,900 deaths between 2010 and 2019. Just last year in Riverside County, there were 1,627 emergency room visits and 65 deaths due to heat.   
Where I live, people use oscillating fans in addition to coolers. We put small bags of ice behind the fans so it will blow cool air. But it doesn’t cool, it just circulates humid air inside our home. It isn’t adequate, especially for small children. And it’s dangerous — you run the risk of electric shock, outages or a burnt fuse as the ice melts. 
Power outages in the summer also are becoming more frequent, due to a lousy energy infrastructure. In mid-August, we went four days without electricity. Food spoiled, down power lines blocked streets and we were left without air conditioning, coolers or fans.
How many families have to survive like this before our state leaders take meaningful action?
We need elected officials and agencies to work together to strive toward a reality where all Californians can be safe in their own homes from extreme heat and related illness and death. SB 655 would push the state toward a future where we all have the right to indoor cooling. 
Families and communities like mine can’t afford to wait.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/07132023_Extreme-Heat_DD_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

Mom of California overdose victim pledges to keep fighting in Capitol,Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/09/mental-health-insurance-bill-dies/,"After a CalMatters investigation, lawmakers asked Christine Matlock Dougherty to testify on behalf of bills to regulate mental health insurance. They didn't pass this year.","In summary
After a CalMatters investigation, lawmakers asked Christine Matlock Dougherty to testify on behalf of bills to regulate mental health insurance. They didn’t pass this year.


Christine Matlock Dougherty received the text just after noon on the last Friday in August.
The mental health legislation she’d been advocating for in memory of her son was dead, held indefinitely by the state Senate Appropriations Committee in an annual culling of bills. 
Just like that. 
Poof.
In the text, Sherry Daley, a lobbyist with the California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Professionals, which sponsored the bill, explained simply:
“The bill was held. It won’t be moving forward this year. Sorry.”
More than four years have passed since Dougherty lost her 23-year-old son, Ryan Matlock, to a fentanyl overdose after his insurance refused to cover his stay in residential treatment. 
The office of Matt Haney, a Democratic state assemblymember from San Francisco, had reached out to her after CalMatters described her son’s passing in a special report on mental health insurance denials. The lawmaker asked her to testify on behalf of the bill to help prevent similar tragedies. 
She initially hesitated.
Talking about what happened to Ryan was already so painful. And to a room full of strangers in suits? With a video recording going?
But Haney’s office explained that Assembly Bill 669 would prevent health plans from reviewing a patient’s eligibility to stay in substance use treatment for the first 28 days after an in-network provider first approved the treatment. Ryan’s health plan had declined to cover his stay at the treatment facility after just three days.
Dougherty knew what her son would want her to do.
In recent months, Dougherty made three trips up to the state Capitol to testify on behalf of Haney’s proposal and another insurance-related bill that would require health plans to report data about how often they deny treatment. 
On those visits, she breathed deep, dabbed her eyes, told her story. 
If talking about what happened to Ryan could change the law, it seemed worth it.
But what if the law didn’t change?
Insurers lobbied against it. The California Association of Health Plans, which opposed the bill, said via email that it could have led to patients remaining in treatment longer than necessary, and could have created openings for bad actors in a residential treatment industry they said was already beset with “widespread waste, fraud and abuse”.
Haney’s bill wasn’t the only one held by the Senate Appropriations Committee that Friday. The committee is the last check before a bill can go to a final Senate vote. It sometimes holds bills without explanation. 
Of 425 bills that came before the committee, 309 were sent along to the Senate floor. 
A representative of state Sen. Anna Caballero, the committee’s chairperson, did not immediately respond to an email and phone call requesting comment Monday. But the bill’s supporters have their own theories about the reasons for its demise. 
Among them:
The state is in an extremely tough financial year, with revenue streams down and federal funding at risk. The Department of Managed Health Care’s estimate that the bill would cost more than $2 million a year  — an amount Haney calls “less than budget dust” — certainly didn’t help its chances.
The health insurance lobby opposed the bill and the state agency that regulates most health plans didn’t offer its help.  A spokesperson for the Department of Managed Health Care said it didn’t take a position on the bill.

Or, perhaps, the bill’s proponents say, they just ran out of time.
Haney called the bill’s loss “devastating.” He dismissed cost as a nonsensical “completely backward” reason for killing the bill. 
“When we don’t invest in treatment and we don’t get people off of drugs, there are astronomical costs to our state at every single level,” he said. “And so this is about investing in prevention, but it’s also simply holding private insurers accountable to Californians who should get the care they’re paying for.”
He pointed to what he described as a pattern of bills being killed in the Legislature, ones that hold private health insurers to account.
“That’s a pattern that Californians should be deeply angry about,” he said.
Families like Ryan’s “have the courage to share their story and it’s painful and it’s traumatizing and they put hope that we will hear them,” he said. “And in this case the Legislature did not and so we have to move forward and we have to try again.”

Dougherty, for her part, had originally assumed the entire Legislature would have the chance to weigh in on the proposal before it was discarded, not just a small cadre of senators. 
She felt frustrated. But also proud.
She had done her best to help make the experiences of families like her own a little more human for policymakers, a little less lost in talk of statistics and probabilities.

This story was originally reported The 19th.
President Donald Trump on Monday downplayed the severity of domestic violence crimes, saying that were it not for “things that take place in the home they call crime,” the administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., would have resulted in a bigger statistical reduction in crime.
“They said, ‘Crime’s down 87 percent.’ I said, no, no, no — it’s more than 87 percent, virtually nothing. And much lesser things, things that take place in the home they call crime. You know, they’ll do anything they can to find something. If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime. See? So now I can’t claim 100 percent but we are. We are a safe city,” Trump said.
The president’s comments were part of a speech he delivered at the Religious Liberty Commission’s meeting at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.
Domestic violence has long been recognized by the federal government as a national public health and safety crisis. A national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 in 10 women and 1 in 4 men have experienced physical or sexual violence or stalking by an intimate partner.
Next month marks the 25th annual Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which coincides with the 2000 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The law increased federal funding to combat domestic violence and other crimes that disproportionately affect women, recognizing the matter as a public health and safety issue, not a private domestic matter.
The federal government is by far the biggest source of funding for anti-domestic violence efforts, and since taking office, the Trump administration has sought to restrict nonprofits’ access to federal domestic violence grants. They have also laid off a top official and several teams working on the issue, threatening to destabilize domestic violence services and prevention efforts nationwide.
In a statement to The 19th, the White House said the president wasn’t “talking about or downplaying domestic violence.”
“President Trump’s Executive Order to address crime in DC even specifically took action against domestic violence,” said Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House. The order urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate housing providers who don’t comply with requirements to “restrict tenants who engage in criminal activity,” including domestic violence.
The White House also pointed out that the administration barred transgender women from women’s domestic abuse shelters, a move that advocates warn makes trans women less safe.
“While President Trump is making America safer, the Fake News is whipping up their latest hoax in real time to distract from the Administration’s tremendous results,” Jackson said.
Some groups focused on combating domestic violence criticized the president’s comments.
“The DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence believes that intimate partner violence is a crime and more than a ‘little fight with the wife’ as President Trump stated earlier today. Per federal and local statute, domestic violence is a crime and one that is not only a precursor to domestic violence homicides, but also a common factor in community violence, including mass shootings, where perpetrators often have a history of committing domestic violence,” said Dawn Dalton, the coalition’s executive director.
“The idea that domestic abuse is serious and criminal is not up for debate. Words cannot take us backwards and the days of treating domestic and sexual violence as ‘private matters’ are long gone. Any attempt to minimize these crimes does not change the impact of domestic violence and cannot change the reality of crime statistics in Washington, D.C.,” said Casey Carter Swegman, director of public policy at Tahirih Justice Center.
“By reducing domestic violence to a ‘little fight,’ President Trump revives a regressive view from an era when survivors were expected to endure abuse alone, without legal protections or public support, said Susanna Saul Director, Legal Programs at Her Justice, a nonprofit that provides free legal services to women living in poverty in New York City. “This does more than trivialize domestic abuse. It emboldens abusers to increase their violence and risks undoing decades of legal and cultural progress that have made safety a community responsibility, rather than a private burden.”
Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Wisconsin who has championed legislative efforts against domestic violence, said such crimes amount to “abuse that devastates families, endangers women and children, and takes lives every single day.”
“As a survivor of domestic violence, I found President Trump’s comments today downplaying domestic violence deeply offensive and disturbing,” she said in a statement. “Trump has a long history of violence against women that makes his dismissiveness unsurprising.”
Rep. Debbie Dingell, another survivor of domestic violence, said Trump’s comments threaten to set back the clock on the national conversation around domestic violence. “We’ve been fighting for decades to remove the stigma around domestic violence, and this position from the president directly opposes those efforts,” she said. “Let me tell you, as someone who hid in a closet many times as a child, being tough on crime means keeping women and children safe in their own homes.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2233408346-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

Currently, 22 donors have made contributions to the effort, with nine of them making the most substantial donations or pledges — $20 million each — allowing them to bear the title of “founding captains” and appearing on snowboards with crystals, resembling disco balls.
“With today’s milestone, we accomplished two things. First, we laid the financial foundation to host great games in 2034. This is essential,” said Fraser Bullock, executive chair and president of the 2034 Olympic Organizing Committee. “Second, we opened the door to be able to execute the first pillar of our vision, which is to elevate our communities.”
Utah reaches another olympic milestone — securing its organizing committee

The list of organizations donating $20 million include the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation, Robert H. and Katharine B. Garff Foundation, Huntsman Family Foundation, Maverik, Larry H. & Gail Miller Family Foundation, Ryan and Ashley Smith Foundation, The Daniels Fund, John and Marcia Price Family Foundation and Matthew and Tatiana Prince.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also made commitments to support the 2034 games, Bullock added during his remarks. Its contributions will be made public in the coming weeks.
Representatives from the contributing organizations attended the launch party on Monday sporting matching blue Olympic-themed jackets. State lawmakers, Gov. Spencer Cox and first lady Abby Cox also joined the event.
The current donations and pledges are part of a goal to raise $300 million through the initiative. With the committee’s total budget being about $4 billion to organize the games, that target sets a “fantastic foundation” for their objectives, Bullock said after the event.

The money will help funding the games, he added. But also, because it comes early, the organizers are planning to use it for community initiatives starting in 2026, like youth sports and education programs.
A program of this magnitude is a first in the history of the Olympics, Cox said on Monday.
“This has never been done. We’ve gone all the way back to ancient Greece. We’ve done it. We’ve looked. Never happened before,” he said.
The fundraising feat may show enthusiasm for the economic prospects and infrastructure projects the games may bring to the state, but mostly, Cox said, it will be a time of unity. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“The Olympics is an opportunity to share with the world who we are and what we believe in. And who we are, are people that serve and give back, that give charitably, that care more about our neighbors than we care about ourselves,” Cox said.
Referring to the founding donors of Podium34, the governor added, “You represent the very best of our state, but not just the very best of our state, the very best, of humanity, of who we are, or at least who we should be, who we’re aspiring to be. And we’re so grateful to have you in this cause.” 
The new International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, also praised the initiative in a video message, describing Utahns as “longstanding friends of the Olympic movement,” and encouraging organizers to use this momentum to nurture youth and further develop winter sport in the state.  
“Since 2002 your state has grown in diversity, vibrance and global relevance,” Coventry said. “In 2034 you will build on that foundation with unmatched community pride, passion and purpose.”

Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, prefiled HB 8 for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January. It would allow school boards to decide whether to allow campus chaplains and teachers in public school.
Gidley has filed similar legislation in the past. The most recent version cleared the House with a vote of 91 to 4 in April but did not make it to the Senate Education Policy Committee. He said in an interview Monday that getting the bill in earlier will give it a better chance to pass.
“We were a little bit late getting it on the floor this past year. It didn’t fail in the Senate because of any problems, it just ran out of time. So I think getting it in earlier is going to help us to be able to work it through both chambers this year,” he said.
Gidley’s goal for the chaplains is that they go to the schools as needed to provide services and support for the faculty and staff in schools. He said this could help  teachers in rural counties who lack resources for mental health services.
“It could be a resource they could tap into when they may not be able to tap into other resources that could offer support,” Gidley said.
Critics of the legislation said the measure would violate the separation of church and state in schools.
Each local board of education would vote on whether to approve volunteer chaplains for schools under the measure. If approved by the board, volunteers would have to complete a “recognized chaplain training program” and a background check.
The legislation specifies that schools cannot accept a volunteer who’s been “adjudicated or convicted of an offense that requires registration as a sex offender.” 
Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, backed a similar bill last year. SB294 was passed by the Senate, but it failed to get House approval.
He said in a phone interview Thursday that chaplains are needed in schools.
“We have many situations in our schools that require a need for counseling and for support — not only for students, but for staff and teachers as well,” he said.
Chaplains would provide “support, services and programs” as requested by teachers under the measure. But Smitherman said these types of motions are not meant to replace guidance counselors.
“Some of these situations need additional assistance in the areas that those chaplains can provide,” Smitherman said. “And the guidance counselor is not for the teachers and the staff workers, so this will make it available to them as well.”
Gidley said guidance counselors and chaplains serve different functions within the school.
“They’re not even in the same category and so it’s totally absurd to even think that one would replace the other,” he said. “These chaplains are strictly there for moral, and if need be, spiritual guidance. Whatever the situation is, if somebody needs a confidential nonpartisan place to share something they could be dealing with, I think that could be extremely helpful with our teachers and administrators in the school system.”

,California,2025-09-09 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Political friction percolates over California housing policy and workers comp payouts,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/political-friction-housing-policy-workers-comp/,"In the final week of the legislative session, state and local officials are arguing over a housing density bill and how much local governments can share in workers' on-the-job injury money.","Conflict between California’s state officials and its nearly 500 cities and counties — especially over money — is nothing new.
However, relations between state and local governments these days are arguably the worst in living memory, as illustrated by a couple of issues percolating in the final week of the 2025 legislative session.
Senate Bill 79, the latest of many state efforts to force local governments to accept high-density housing projects, is one point of contention. It would essentially exempt such projects that are within a half mile of public transit services from local oversight, regardless of the building site’s local zoning.
“This is exactly where we should be building more housing, right by our highest quality transit,” says state Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill’s author.
It has drawn heavy criticism from local officials, who would lose their ability to oversee such projects, and from residents of single-family neighborhoods that could be affected. 
Opponents even include the Los Angeles City Council, dominated by Wiener’s fellow progressive Democrats. The council voted 8-5 to oppose the measure, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed on, saying cities with state-approved housing plans should be exempt. 
“While I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide, as written, this bill risks unintended consequences for LA,” Bass said.
Housing and homelessness have been especially sharp issues in relations between state and local governments ever since Gavin Newsom became governor in 2019. While campaigning for the office, Newsom pledged to jump-start housing construction and reduce the state’s large population of homeless people.
Newsom has signed numerous bills meant to spur housing construction by reducing local land use authority, and his administration has cracked down on cities that fail to designate enough land to meet state housing quotas. However, the state still falls very short of its declared level of needed housing production.
Newsom also promised to appoint a homelessness czar who would oversee programs to reduce homelessness and, after being prodded by reporters, he finally declared himself to be the czar. As homelessness levels remained high despite the state spending more than $20 billion, Newsom shifted blame to local officials for, he said, not being aggressive enough in cleaning up encampments and sheltering their inhabitants.
“I’m not interested in funding failure any longer,” he said at one point. “So I’m going to speak for myself, just one guy that’s got three more appropriation cycles in front of him. I want to see results. Everybody wants to see results.”
After threatening to cut off direct aid to local governments for homelessness programs, he signed a budget in June that suspends funding for at least a year. Local officials contend that getting one-year appropriations, without guarantees of continuity, makes it impossible for them to establish ongoing housing projects and services.
Thus, the issue is a stalemate that could continue until Newsom vacates his office 16 months hence.
In addition to these high-profile points of contention between state and local officials, there is a spate of relatively minor issues, one of which is Senate Bill 487. Sponsored by a raft of police and firefighter unions, the measure would limit the amount of money public employers could recover from their employees’ lawsuits for on-the-job injuries.
Local governments opposed the bill, saying it could potentially increase their worker compensation costs. Their opposition turned to bitter denunciation last week after state government was exempted from its impact.
“This is classic state do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do hypocrisy,” said Graham Knaus, CEO of the California State Association of Counties. “It’s a clear indication that lawmakers know this is terrible public policy, but they’re fine forcing local governments to live with it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/042220_Housing-Construction_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

BALDWIN, Mich. — Cell service begins to fade a few miles from town, as billboards advertising chain restaurants shift to roadside signs peddling used boats.
Nestled among winding rivers in a stretch of Michigan those in more populous parts call “up north,” Baldwin is a village of just over 1,000 stitched with dirt roads, boarded-up homes and “No Trespassing” signs.
A 25-foot statue of a trout watches over the main drag. And just to the north, pine trees conceal one of the most remote immigration detention centers in the country.
Here, outdoor recreation is both a lifestyle and – along with the private prison – one of the only lifelines in a place where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line.

“There isn’t a lot of opportunities for individuals here,” Lake County Sheriff Rich Martin said. “If they want to have a job, they have to go elsewhere, usually, or they have to work at a lower-paying job.”
When The GEO Group this year opened the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest down the road, the town found itself caught up in a national conversation.
President Donald Trump’s administration has launched a massive expansion of immigration detention, a crucial step toward fulfilling Trump’s pledge to carry out mass deportations. The goal is to expand capacity to hold immigrants who, in the past, often would have been released while awaiting deportation.
Federal officials want to increase the number of beds from 41,500 to 100,000 nationwide by awarding billion-dollar contracts to private prison companies, primarily GEO and CoreCivic. Both companies’ stock prices surged by more than 60% after Trump’s reelection.
“We believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to assist the federal government in meeting its expanded immigration enforcement priorities,” GEO’s CEO, Dave Donahue, said on a May call with investors.

The extensive tax and spending bill Trump signed in July gives U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement $45 billion – about five times its overall budget last year – to expand detention capacity.
“Our priority is to arrest and remove,” said John Tsoukaris, ICE field office director in Newark, New Jersey, where detention has prompted pushback and protests.
Across the U.S., some 60,000 people are being held in ICE detention — a 51% increase since January, according to the nonprofit Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
Despite Trump’s promises to target criminals, about 70% of those detained have no criminal record; many others have convictions for offenses as minor as a traffic violation.
As shuttered detention centers reopen, the communities that surround them are grappling with the consequences – questioning the morality of immigration detention, expressing concerns about shifting local identities and fighting back in the courtroom.
“We should be welcoming the stranger, not locking them up,” said Kathy O’Leary, who has led multiple demonstrations outside of Newark’s Delaney Hall, the first ICE detention center to reopen during Trump’s second term.

Even Leavenworth, Kansas, a town synonymous with prisons, is hesitant to support detaining people outside the criminal justice system.
“We are known as a prison town,” local Ashley Hernandez said. “But having an ICE detention facility … is not something that many of the residents want.”
Up in Baldwin, the expansion of immigration detention brings skepticism, too.
But it also brings hope.
 ‘When you don’t have jobs, what do you do?’

The North Lake Correctional Facility has cycled through many phases since GEO opened it in 1999. It has housed juvenile offenders, out-of-state inmates and noncitizens convicted of federal crimes. It’s also closed four different times.
Each opening brought jobs, and each shutdown left Baldwin struggling.
“It’s just not consistent, you know?” Martin said. Never mind the politics, the Republican sheriff added. The community’s more immediate concern about the windfall from North Lake is that “it doesn’t last.”
After sitting idle for three years, the 1,800-bed facility reopened in June under a new ICE contract and a new name: the North Lake Processing Center. Situated off a dirt road 3 miles from town, the detention center could easily be missed. But its economic footprint is clear.
GEO estimates the center could generate over $70 million in its first full year of operations. When open, the facility is the largest employer in Lake County; even when idle, it remains the county’s biggest taxpayer.
The hope among those backing the reopening is that those economic benefits trickle down to their wallets.
Shelly Keene, executive director of Michigan Works! West Central, which matches job seekers with employers, said even short-term jobs in Baldwin would have an impact.
“Even if an individual is employed for a year or two making a high wage, it’s better than sitting at home and not making a wage at all, or maybe waiting tables or being a bartender,” said Keene, who added that two of her former co-workers had already returned to jobs at North Lake.
In June, Keene’s organization held a hiring fair in Baldwin to help fill 500 positions at the detention center. And although GEO employees reassured potential applicants that the facility was there to stay, advocacy group No Detention Centers in Michigan notes that GEO mostly hires outsiders, with just 69 of 300 jobs going to Lake County residents the last time the facility operated.
Keene acknowledged that many locals either don’t meet GEO’s qualifications or aren’t interested, leaving the company to look outside the county for employees.
Still, she said: “Having individuals traveling in and out of Lake County, they’re spending their money at the gas stations. They’re stopping at Jones’ for ice cream. They’re going to Barski’s for dinner.”
Those who oppose the facility argue that the promised economic benefits come at too high a cost.
In June, about 150 protesters gathered at a park near Baldwin, holding signs and chanting, “No to GEO! We can do better!” The demonstration, organized by the Democratic Party in next-door Manistee County and No Detention Centers in Michigan, focused on the morality of detention.
“It’s a carceral community that holds the town hostage, and then when they’re done, they leave,” organizer Eric Lampinen said.
Lampinen, who lives about 45 miles from Baldwin, said he doesn’t judge locals who support the facility.
“I get it,” he said. “When you don’t have jobs, what do you do?”
In an email to News21, a GEO spokesperson said: “We are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” adding that GEO follows federal regulations that “set strict requirements on the treatment and services ICE detainees receive.”
Sara Maddox is a waitress at Shoey’s Log Bar – a “Baldwin staple for nearly 100 years!” as its Facebook page boasts. At the horseshoe-shaped bar, Maddox laughs with regulars and greets them by name.
She thinks most of the opposition to the new detention center is coming from outsiders. “The protests don’t exactly show the way that we feel here,” she said.
A few of her friends applied at North Lake, drawn by one of the area’s few jobs with strong benefits. At the same time, Maddox remembers how takeout orders dropped by almost 15% when North Lake closed in 2022.
“We’re excited for the growth, but I think the up and down of the North Lake facility, the opening and the closing, has taken its toll on the community,” she said.
Lake County is Trump country. Some 65% of residents voted for him over Kamala Harris. For residents such as Debbie Russell, though, the detention debate isn’t about politics – it’s about the needs of her neighbors.
Russell has lived in Baldwin for more than 50 years and works at her daughter’s fabrics shop. While she does not fully agree with how the administration is handling immigration, she supports the reopening of North Lake.
“I just hope they stay open and it goes on for a while,” she said.

Communities in at least eight states, some deep red, others the bluest of blue, are navigating the reopening of detention centers, several of which have histories of abuse.
At least four places — Newark, Leavenworth, New York City and Washington state — have challenged the expansion of immigration detention, in some cases by citing local ordinances. Leavenworth, for instance, is suing CoreCivic for trying to reopen a facility without obtaining a special use permit.
But nowhere is the opposition more fervent than in New Jersey – a state where one in four residents is an immigrant.

The Statue of Liberty welcomes ships from the Atlantic as they enter New York Harbor but turns her back on Newark, where immigration detention spreads in her shadow.
Just 5 miles behind her lies GEO-owned Delaney Hall and its razor wire fences. From its doorstep, petrochemical storage vats block the view to the Passaic River. Garbage trucks rumble past, headed for the state’s largest trash incinerator up the road. And if the wind blows just right, the faint smell of burning flesh lingers from a nearby animal fat rendering plant.
This area, northeast of Newark Liberty International Airport, is zoned specifically for heavy industry. No one is supposed to live here. Hotels, community centers and even animal shelters are prohibited. The only “residential” buildings allowed are Delaney Hall and the Essex County Correctional Facility.
Delaney, which operated as an ICE detention facility from 2011 to 2017, can hold about 1,000 people, dwarfing the only other immigration detention center in the state by 700 beds. GEO reopened it May 1, despite yearslong efforts in New Jersey to put a stop to immigration detention.
In 2021, lawmakers banned state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention, and several facilities ceased operations. CoreCivic sued, and a judge ruled that while New Jersey may limit state and local entities, it cannot prohibit private companies from doing business with ICE.
The city of Newark has also challenged detention. In an April complaint, officials alleged Delaney Hall was a danger to staff and detainees because GEO wouldn’t allow the city to inspect the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. GEO called the lawsuit “politically motivated.” The case is still pending even as operations at Delaney persist.

In the first month and a half after the facility reopened, tensions boiled over twice. First came a scuffle that resulted in the arrest of Newark’s mayor and the indictment of a congresswoman – both Democrats – who were trying to inspect the facility. In the second, four men escaped amid a clash between guards and detainees who were upset over conditions.
“Any sort of detention environment is obviously not going to present with good conditions, but private detention facilities are worried about their bottom line – profits are really their goal,” said Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
GEO declined to respond directly to emailed questions, but said in a statement that its support services are monitored by ICE and other organizations within the Department of Homeland Security to “ensure strict compliance.”
The company said it provides services that include “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietician-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice … religious beliefs.”
GEO referred questions to ICE; the agency’s national office did not respond to requests for comment.
Tsoukaris, the Newark ICE director, said he doesn’t understand why people are protesting facilities such as Delaney Hall.
“If you’re here illegally and you’re committing crimes, I don’t know why some people think it’s OK,” Tsoukaris said, despite statistics that show a majority of those detained have no significant criminal record. “You’re allowed to protest. But why are you protesting?”

Leaving the facility one morning in June, K.B., an American citizen who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing her nursing job, led her toddler son toward their car.
She had just finished visiting her husband of two years, who has been in the country for the past 21. Originally from Brazil, he was detained based on a 2005 deportation order, which a lawyer had been working to get dismissed, K.B. said.
Their situation reflects a new reality for immigrants without legal status. A year ago, ICE probably would have ignored someone like K.B.’s husband, who she said has no criminal record. If he had been detained, he likely would have been released pending resolution of the deportation order.
K.B. said her husband’s work as a general contractor accounted for the vast majority of their combined $120,000 income.
“We’d do everything like a family,” she said through tears. “Now, it’s totally changed. I’m starting to feel the burden of taking all of the responsibilities: taking care of the house, the bills, having to work and now having to find child care.”
Advocates worry K.B.’s story could become more common.
Said Linhorst of the ACLU: “The more detention beds we get, the more people are detained, which means the more families are disrupted and communities are harmed.”
 A prison town’s identity is put to the test

With its historical landmarks and Victorian homes flying U.S. flags, Leavenworth radiates small-town Americana.
As the first incorporated city of Kansas, the community carries multiple identities: a town rooted in military tradition and pioneer history, yet nationally known for the five prisons scattered around town.
“It’s the tenacity of the people that really defines Leavenworth,” said Ashley Hernandez, who works with the local Sisters of Charity. “Leavenworth is not made up of a bunch of people that are willing to just roll back and let something happen.”
Now, that identity is being put to the test.
CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the Leavenworth Detention Center under a contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 people. The city has sued, leading to a temporary injunction blocking the facility from reopening without a permit.
Frustrated by the national attention, City Manager Scott Peterson said the city’s stance is not political, but simply a land use issue.
“There’s more to this town than just a fight with a CoreCivic facility – and more to this town than the prisons,” he said.

Yet prisons have long shaped the town’s narrative, economically and culturally.
After the Fort Leavenworth U.S. Army base and the Veterans Affairs hospital, prisons are Leavenworth’s third-largest employer. Home to the nation’s oldest federal penitentiary, the city of 37,000 has housed infamous figures such as Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly.
CoreCivic’s ties to Leavenworth run deep. Its CEO, Damon Hininger, was born in the city and started his career as a corrections officer at the Leavenworth Detention Center, which opened in 1992 to house people awaiting trial on federal charges.
CoreCivic began talks with Leavenworth County officials about reopening the detention center during the Biden administration, but some residents pushed back over rumors that migrants would be processed and then released into town while they awaited court proceedings.
In its new proposal, CoreCivic promised that “no ICE detainees will be released into the Leavenworth community.”
The Leavenworth Detention Center — now rebranded as the Midwest Regional Reception Center — faced years of scrutiny. A 2017 Department of Justice report found it dangerously understaffed, with an officer vacancy rate as high as 23%.
Opposition has coalesced into a grassroots coalition of residents and immigration advocates who meet weekly in a grocery store Starbucks. They organize public panels, attend City Commission meetings and hold “teach-ins” to explore ways to “keep CoreCivic’s doors closed.”
At one recent panel, about 90 people gathered to protest the reopening, listening as former CoreCivic employees shared accounts of violence and neglect.
“The job is not worth it,” said attendee Muñeca Nieves, who volunteers with an immigrant advocacy organization. “They may pay well, but at what risk?”

Joining the fight are the Catholic nuns at the Sisters of Charity, who have been speaking out at news conferences and holding prayer vigils.
“Our sisters have been moved, in a way that I haven’t seen them moved before, toward action,” said Rebecca Metz, who directs the social justice advocacy office for the Sisters of Charity in Leavenworth. “This has really set a fire in their sails, and they’re ready.”
In an emailed statement, CoreCivic acknowledged past challenges at its Leavenworth facility but objected to “broad and generalized criticisms of the conditions in which our facilities operate.”
“Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process that they are entitled to,” wrote company spokesman Ryan Gustin. “All our immigration facilities operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability.”
Despite growing opposition, Leavenworth remains a town of contrasts, given that some residents support the reopening of the facility.
Jason Claire, who runs a military antiques and surplus shop, said he welcomes the expansion as an opportunity for a struggling downtown.
Claire said city officials are too focused on shaping Leavenworth’s image, rather than addressing its economic challenges. He pointed to recent efforts by leaders to rebrand Leavenworth as the “First City of Kansas,” a nod to its more charming pioneer roots.
“They’ve worked to keep it from being just a prison town,” Claire said. “But when you get down to soup and nuts, it’s a prison town.”

In 2024, 60% of Leavenworth County voted for Trump, and like some residents of Baldwin, Claire believes the most vocal opposition to detention comes from a politically motivated group of outsiders.
“They’re shooting themselves, and our community, in the foot, because it’s an opportunity to help spur the city and get it going,” Claire said.
Despite Claire’s stance, about 90% of the more than two dozen people who addressed the facility at City Commission meetings from February to June spoke against it, according to a News21 review of meeting minutes.
The legal battle continues, but for many, the fight is about more than proper permitting or economic opportunity.
The debate has exposed a deeper reckoning over the moral cost of immigration detention in America — and whether a town long defined by incarceration is willing to profit from another chapter of it.
“We’re taking away children’s parents,” said Sister Therese Bangert, a member of the Sisters of Charity. “We’re just causing anguish to lock them up. And then some people, like CoreCivic, are making money on it.”

Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless. (Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images)The confusion and commotion over cryptocurrency often reminds me of the 19th-century German drama Faust. In Goethe’s masterpiece, the devil Mephistopheles offers an emperor the tantalising vision of limitless wealth through the printing of paper money.
The emperor grasps the idea (unheard of at the time the play is set), and the magical wealth which paper creates brings brief prosperity to his troubled dominion.
But what appeared to be an inexhaustible source of value soon proves illusory. A combination of misunderstanding and hype leads to economic and moral corruption, and the empire descends into chaos.
It is a tale which could well have parallels for digital currencies now. People use them despite not fully understanding how they work, sometimes to their financial loss.
And history shows us that we should be wary of the idea that currency systems always change for the better, following some sort of natural evolutionary path. In fact, new currency systems don’t always succeed, and even when they do, monetary regime change can be a long and arduous process.
Coins and tokens were used more than 2,000 years ago, and continued through to the 19th century before paper finally dominated. Rather than a clean, irreversible shift from coins to notes, nations often alternated between the two systems.
There were failed experiments with paper money in 14th-century China, 17th-century Sweden and 18th-century France, to mention just a few.
Research on these problematic attempts suggests that social division also makes new currency shifts especially vulnerable.
During the American war of independence for example, a currency (the “continental dollar”) was briefly introduced in 1775. It was later abandoned due to mismanagement and misunderstanding, but had also served to sharpen political tensions between the patriots who supported it, and the loyalists to Britain, who detested it.
Similarly, in the 1750s and 1760s, the Swedish government issued non-redeemable paper money to pay its war debts. The consequent extreme inflation coincided with intense social division and led to a period of political chaos.
In 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, a paper form of government bond was issued, which rapidly lost its value. Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless.
Britain fared slightly better, as I explore in my book The Age of Paper. Its departure from the metal standard in 1797, amid the financial pressures of the Anglo–French war, did not produce a collapse of the nation’s paper currency.
But the paper-based regime came to a halt in 1819, a year of bitter class conflicts, which culminated in the Peterloo massacre, where at least 18 people were killed and hundreds wounded by the cavalry at a peaceful rally for democratic reform. The public had come to detest Bank of England notes, which became a symbol of economic depression and political oppression.
Britain then followed the pattern of other nations, reverting to a traditional monetary system that rested on the solid value of precious metals.
These cases of failed paper currencies – and there are many more – show that the general acceptance of currency ultimately requires shared values and social solidarity. Paper currency works when people trust it, knowing that it has been valued and accepted by others in the past, and will be valued and accepted in the future.
It would otherwise be unlikely for a piece of paper to become a reliable means of payment and value. Once such shared values are lost, there is usually a downward cycle of currency depreciation.
 Cryptic currency

In the 21st-century, cryptocurrencies challenge the conventional idea of money as something of value – or at least linked to something of value, like gold. And as something that is issued and managed by a trusted central authority.
For cryptocurrencies exist only in the realm of blockchain technology. Their value is created and maintained not by central banks, but by complex computer algorithms.
To many, all of these abstract computational processes make cryptocurrencies as mysterious as Mephistopheles’ dark magic in Faust.
Even so, with Donald Trump’s strong support, cryptocurrencies are enjoying a surge in popularity. This trend will undoubtedly be reinforced by further deregulation which means requirements for transparency will be relaxed, and safeguards for consumer protection weakened.
The rise in popularity has coincided with the US government’s apparent preference for weakening the dollar in the international currency markets as a way of boosting US exports by pushing down the prices of US goods abroad.
These events may lead to a profound transformation in the monetary system on a global scale. As the US dollar loses value and crypto regulations are relaxed, countries and investors around the world may be enticed to diversify their assets and increase their holdings of cryptocurrency.
But the combination of social division and rapid expansion may not be a positive sign for the future of cryptocurrency. Far from establishing it as a dominant medium of exchange in a new decentralised regime, history suggests that its rapid growth in a fractured society might instead accelerate its self-destruction.

(Photo courtesy American Wild Horse Conservation)America’s wild horses have faced competition from livestock, unfair resource allocation, and shrinking habitat for generations. The federal government’s response has been traumatic and controversial, including helicopter roundups at taxpayer expense. These roundups have proven ineffective in the long term, yet they continue, despite the outrageous cost.
Nevada’s Virginia Range is home to a treasured population of wild horses facing a shrinking habitat because of human and industrial encroachment. The Virginia Range, just east of Reno, is also home to the world’s largest wild horse fertility control program, proving another path is possible — and it’s working. American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC) is leading the way in humanely reversing wild horse population growth through its self-funded fertility control program. Having recently finished its sixth year (and beginning year seven), the program has achieved something remarkable: an 82 percent reduction in foal births between January-June 2025 compared to the same period in 2020.
Seeking to demonstrate that well-researched fertility control could be scaled up, the results of AWHC’s work were analyzed, peer-reviewed and published in the journal Vaccines last year, marking the most successful wild horse fertility control program of its size in the United States — if not the world.
The Virginia Range program uses an immunocontraceptive vaccine known as PZP (porcine zona pellucida). Administered by trained volunteers via remote darting, PZP prevents pregnancy in mares without harming hormone cycles or behaviors, and it’s reversible. Unlike roundups, it doesn’t traumatize or remove horses from their habitat.
The scale of this effort is significant. 
More than 40 community volunteers have worked across almost 300,000 acres to reach over 70 percent of reproductive-age mares. Combined with natural attrition and predation, their efforts have begun to reduce the overall population in areas where darting is consistently applied. These results are impressive, and they prove that humane management without cruel and costly helicopter roundups is a viable option for our nation’s wild herds.
Notably, the program operates without state or federal funding. Local businesses, including Blockchains Inc. and the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, have helped support access and logistics, making it a model of public-private cooperation. It’s a humane, scientifically sound, and fiscally responsible approach. And yet it remains the exception, not the rule.
Despite $11 million of funding made available by Congress, federal agencies, particularly the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), have yet to embrace fertility control as a primary management strategy. 
Instead, they continue to round up thousands of wild horses each year and house them in long-term holding facilities, where many remain for life, at 30 times the cost per horse of in-the-wild fertility control. 
The USA now has more wild horses in captivity than running free on the rangelands in the West.
According to government reports, this system now consumes over two-thirds of the BLM’s wild horse and burro budget, costing taxpayers $100 million annually.
There is no denying that wild horse management is complex. Habitats are shrinking due to development, drought, and competing land uses. But as AWHC’s Virginia Range project shows, compassionate and cost-effective solutions already exist — and they’re scalable. What’s lacking is the political will to shift away from outdated and inhumane practices toward methods that are proven to work.
If the federal government is serious about reforming wild horse management, it should look west to Nevada, where a group of citizen scientists and volunteers is making history.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tracy-Wilson-d-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-09-09 08:57:38.775966

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pat Suozzi: Vermont lakes and streams like fewer lawns, too! .","This commentary is by Pat Suozzi, of Hinesburg. Suozzi is the president of the Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds.


In the recent opinion piece “Vermonters Get Rid of Your Lawns,” author Lucie Lehmann describes the wonderful transformation that took place when she removed her lawn and planted native perennials and grasses. Her yard came alive with color, attracting all sorts of birds, butterflies, native bees and more. She describes many of the benefits of doing this, including reduction in the use of pesticides.
I would like to add another very important benefit of less lawn: improving the health of Vermont’s lakes and streams.
Grass with its shallow roots does not absorb much rainwater. However, native plants, shrubs and trees, with their deeper root systems, are far more absorbent, which significantly reduces stormwater runoff.

Even if you live far from a lake or stream, runoff from a lawn — laden with nutrients, sediment and other pollutants — will end up in a nearby stream and eventually into one of the state’s 800 lakes and ponds.The nutrients, consisting mainly of phosphorus, contribute to creating the toxic cyanobacteria blooms that have closed so many beaches along Lake Champlain and on other lakes in the state. Stormwater flowing across your lawn can also erode roads, carrying that dirt and gravel along with salts and other pollutants into the lakes and streams. 
Removing lawns and planting native species can help to reduce this pollution, protect water quality and bring you the pleasure of a garden full of life that will require little to no mowing and give you more leisure time to get out and enjoy a nearby lake. 
Interested but not sure how to get started? We can help.
The Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds has published a landscaping booklet that includes a variety of landscape design templates and planting plans, lists of native plants, shrubs, and trees, as well as maintenance tips. While this was created mainly for lake shore property owners, all of the designs, native plant lists and maintenance tips are completely relevant to anyone who would like to change their lawn desert into a garden.

(Courtesy of New Jersey Institute of Technology)A federal appeals panel has determined that a New Jersey university was wrong to deny a philosophy professor continued employment after learning he praised Adolf Hitler and made other controversial comments outside the classroom.
Judge Paul Matey of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Jason Reza Jorjani’s off-campus comments were protected by the First Amendment and did not disrupt the New Jersey Institute of Technology’s educational mission, as it claimed.
Matey, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, cited a 2021 federal ruling that sided with an Ohio professor disciplined for refusing to use a transgender student’s preferred pronouns.
“In essence, NJIT posits that because Jorjani offered views it disliked, the First Amendment should not apply,” Matey wrote. “We cannot agree, lest we permit ‘universities to discipline professors, students, and staff any time their speech might cause offense.’”
The 13,000-student university in Newark hired Jorjani in 2015 and renewed his contract in 2016 and 2017. But administrators placed him on paid leave after a New York Times column and video revealed he had made controversial comments about Hitler, race, and immigration, and that he had founded an alt-right corporation and website with white nationalist Richard Spencer.
The university’s president and a dean emailed faculty and staff denouncing Jorjani’s comments, the Faculty Senate issued a statement declaring his views “morally repugnant,” and the school fielded about 50 emailed complaints, according to the ruling. Various departments raised concerns about his views creating a “hostile learning environment” on a campus with a sizeable enrollment of students of color, and administrators accused Jorjani of ethical breaches for failing to mention his alt-right ties in required “association with organizations” disclosures, the ruling said.
The school hired a law firm to investigate, and administrators ultimately decided against renewing his contract, according to the ruling.
Jorjani sued in July 2018, claiming retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. A U.S. District Court judge dismissed his case last year, saying that his speech wasn’t protected by the First Amendment because the school’s “interest in mitigating the disruption caused by Plaintiff’s speech … outweighs Plaintiff’s interest in its expression.”
But Matey said that ruling was “an error,” citing a famous dissent from a 1929 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that defended unpopular political speech.
“Jorjani’s speech occurred entirely outside NJIT’s academic environs. His theories, even if lacking in classical rigor, remain of public import,” Matey wrote. “It matters not that his opinions do not enjoy majoritarian support, since ‘the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘the thought that we hate.'”
College students have an “interest in hearing even contrarian views,” Matey wrote, again citing the Ohio case. The university’s claim that Jorjani’s views were disruptive to the college community was “speculative,” Matey added, noting that they did not incite student protests or upheaval.
Monday’s ruling revives Jorjani’s retaliation claim. Jorjani did not respond to a request for comment. Matthew Golden, a university spokesman, declined to comment.
Matey was nominated to the federal bench by President Donald Trump. He was joined in Monday’s opinion by Judge Peter Phipps, another Trump appointee, and Judge Cheryl Ann Krause, a nominee of Barack Obama.

The bill passed and was signed into law. (Photo by Michele Jokinen/Session Daily)Minnesota House Democrats picked Rep. Zack Stephenson as their new caucus leader Monday, signaling a desire for continuity after the assassination of their late leader Melissa Hortman in June. 
Stephenson, who has represented the Coon Rapids area in the House since 2019, was Hortman’s 2004 campaign manager as an inexperienced, early 20s college student. Hortman was a mentor to Stephenson for 20 years, teaching him about campaigning, fundraising and serving a Twin Cities metro swing district. Stephenson was also a good friend of Hortman’s and served as a pallbearer during her funeral.
In a closed-door meeting, Stephenson garnered votes from the majority of the 66 House Democrats. The circumstances of Hortman’s death made choosing her successor challenging, but multiple contenders campaigned for it, including DFL floor leader Jamie Long and Reps. Tina Liebling, Dave Pinto and Cheryl Youakim.
“I am honored to have the support of my colleagues to serve as caucus leader,” Stephenson said in a statement released by House DFL Monday. “Speaker Hortman is irreplaceable — as a leader, a strategist, a colleague and a friend. While I’ve been chosen to lead, it will take all of us, working together, to move forward, honor Speaker Hortman’s legacy, and build a Minnesota where everyone can succeed. We are all still grieving, but I am confident we can carry our shared work into the future.”
Stephenson is likely to follow Hortman’s well-thumbed political playbook: raise money, recruit sound candidates and incessantly knock on doors.
The House is expected to return to a 67-67 tie between Republicans and Democrats after a Sept. 16 special election to replace Hortman in a solidly blue suburban Brooklyn Park district. Stephenson will need to negotiate with Republicans to pass any legislation, deftly say “no” to unrealistic member demands of his own caucus and raise piles of money to campaign in 2026.
If House Democrats take back control of the House next year, Stephenson will be a frontrunner for House speaker.
Rep. Aisha Gomez, the co-chair of the House Taxes Committee and a leader of the left flank of the party, called Stephenson “smart, tough, capable, empathetic,” in a text message to the Reformer. “He studied at (Hortman’s) side and she trusted him completely. He wants to do right by her and by us and the people of our state. Our caucus is united behind him and collectively we have a lot of brilliance and heart to bring to the work ahead of us.”
Stephenson served as a House Ways and Means committee co-chair this year, putting him at the center of budget negotiations with legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz. He’s also compiled a significant legislative resume, including authorship of the House bill legalizing cannabis in 2023 and a bevy of consumer protections enacted when he was chair of the commerce committee in 2023-24. 
Stephenson is also a Hennepin County prosecutor. 
Stephenson will have to hit the ground running: Walz said he will call a special session on gun control following the Aug. 27 mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, and Stephenson will need to work with House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, to pass any sort of gun or school safety measures. 
Hortman and her husband Mark were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a political assassination by a man who was targeting Democratic elected officials and abortion rights advocates, prosecutors say. Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were severely injured but survived a shooting by the same man, according to charging papers, at their Champlin home on the same night.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/021524-PHOTO-judiciary-MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-09 09:56:16.994865

(IDOA)A program that aims to bring more minority and women-owned businesses into the state’s procurement system is facing possible elimination.
Gov. Mike Braun’s administration sought an advisory opinion Aug. 26 from the Attorney General’s Office on the legality of the Governor’s Commission on Supplier Diversity and the continued implementation of the Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises Program.
The move comes after the state abruptly cancelled its 2025 Business Conference and B2Bloom Expo. The 17th annual gathering, hosted by the Indiana Department of Administration’s Division of Supplier Diversity, showcased opportunities for underrepresented companies to contract with state government.
The agency declined to share why the October conference was cancelled, only saying, “Further details will be shared when they become available.”
A Sunday Facebook post from the Division of Supplier Diversity provided more information on the request while also postponing the group’s third quarter meeting set for Monday.
“Governor Braun requested that the supplier diversity commission meeting be postponed due to pending legal review of the program from the Attorney General. In an effort to save taxpayers money and commissioners their time, the next meeting will be scheduled with appropriate notice following the receipt of the legal opinion.”

The division set participation goals. For instance, the most recent goal was for minority-owned businesses to average 8% across construction, goods and services and professional services contracts; and women receiving 10% of the contracts.
Veteran-owned businesses are also a part of the program, but are not part of the legal review.
The group also tracks disparity between the participation of these groups in the state procurement system.
The request from Department of Administration Commissioner Brandon Clifton is based on a 2023 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States striking down the use of race in college admissions.
It also quotes a 2025 memorandum from the U.S. Attorney General giving guidance on unlawful discrimination for federal funding recipients.
“In recent years, the federal government has turned a blind eye toward, or even encouraged, various discriminatory practices, seemingly because of their purportedly benign labels, objectives, or intentions. No longer. Going forward, the federal government will not stand by while recipients of federal funds engage in discrimination,” the memo said.
It further stated that programs can’t discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, or other protected characteristics — no matter the program’s labels, objectives, or intentions.
Clifton’s request to the Attorney General asked to determine the legality of the entire diversity business program, as well as whether the division must comply with state law requiring a five-year diversity study of contracts. That study is due this year.
Based on the response, Clifton asked if “an alternative program that focused on characteristics such as veterans’ status, small business status, and businesses domiciled in Indiana or with Indiana workers comply with the requirements set forth in current federal law?”
Another question was whether it’s permissible for the state to continue to honor contracts for which requests for proposals have been issued prior to the issuance of an opinion by the Indiana Attorney General’s Office.
It is unclear the timeline for that opinion, which is non-binding.

From the vantage of the 2020s, there’s something quaint about the political style of Martin Olav Sabo. 
A leading Minnesota legislator and congressman of the late 20th century, Sabo was a shoe-leather, door-to-door candidate who never aired an attack ad or publicly slung a demeaning epithet at an opponent. He was a student of the “inside baseball” of the legislative branch of government — calendars, committee assignments, fiscal notes, office space. (And yes, he also studied baseball.) 
He cared not just about what government did but also about how it performed and which level of government was best suited to the task at hand. He didn’t just refuse to demonize members of the opposite party. He befriended them and encouraged their participation in decision-making.
Those characteristics may sound like the practices of an earlier time. But that does not mean they should be dismissed or forgotten. This book was born of a conviction that the Sabo story is worth telling amid the cutthroat partisanship that characterizes 21st century American politics. The anxiety many Americans feel about their system of government makes now an apt time to examine the life and work of someone who showed that it is indeed possible to make that system perform “for the better.” 

Martin Sabo was an institutionalist. But immutable preservation of the Minnesota or the United States houses of representatives was never his goal. He sought those bodies’ improvement (he was too modest — and realistic — to claim that he sought their perfection) for the sake of making them better able to deliver the public services he believed Americans deserved.
When he concluded that institutional rules and norms needed to change to better meet society’s needs, he willingly led the charge to make those changes. But when critics denigrated those institutions or sought to make them dysfunctional — particularly for personal or partisan gain — he rose to their defense. 
Despite his lifelong attachment to those two elective bodies, he understood that they belonged not to him but to the people. His role was one of stewardship. 
…
As many examples both ancient and modern attest, representative democracy isn’t easy. The leadership required to make that system of government effective is not typically in abundant supply — and when such leaders arise, they are not always appreciated by voters. 
But this book asserts that when someone of keen mind and good heart, someone like Martin Sabo, chooses to make representative democracy his life’s work, an admirable result can ensue. That kind of career politician deserves citizens’ respect — and their votes.
Editor’s note: The following passage is from the book’s conclusion: 
The man who approached me to write this book at the behest of a group of Sabo friends wanted to lift up something more than public policy. 
“I’m hung up on leadership,” said Bill Kelly, a former DFL legislator who served with Sabo. “I know no one more intent than Martin was on making the system work better for all the right reasons.”
At age 82 in 2022, Kelly was ailing with the cancer that would take his life on July 31, 2023. Like his friend Sabo, Kelly had a lifelong love affair with representative democracy. As Sabo did at the end of his life, Kelly was watching with dismay as elected officials often appeared to put short-term electoral advantage ahead of the long-term interests of the state and nation.
Winning the next election was never Sabo’s ultimate goal, Kelly said. Good governance was. The temptations of political expediency — the demonizing of opponents, the twisting of facts into half-truths and even lies, the shilling for campaign donors — were to be avoided because they undermined good governance.
“Martin’s view came out of his North Dakota experience, growing up in a small town. You give a damn about the whole thing. Not just your own career or your own glory. It’s, ‘How does the whole place function? What can you do to make that better?’ That’s what he educated us about,” Kelly said.
That’s what leadership in American government should be about.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090113mej087_001-1.jpg,,,2025-09-09 09:56:16.994865

In an interview with The Independent shortly after taking the oath of office in a private ceremony in Jefferson City, Hanaway said now-former Attorney General Andrew Bailey was committed to upholding the constitution and protecting the rights of Missourians. 
But as Missouri’s fourth attorney general in six years, Hanaway made it clear her approach to the office is “going to be a different style.”
She expressed little interest in headline-grabbing lawsuits or cable-news hits. Her focus, she said, will be things like Medicaid fraud, consumer protection and violent crimes. 
“Instead of ‘we defend the state of Missouri,’ I think it’s even better to say that ‘we defend Missourians,’” she said. “Of course it’s important to defend the Constitution, but I do want to do the cases that might have an impact on just a person or a couple of people who’ve been victims.”

That kind of change would be a welcome one after years of attorneys general using the office to “make a name for themselves in the news and bow down to the Trump agenda,” said state Rep. Jaclyn Zimmermann, a Democrat from Manchester, who clerked for a federal judge when Hanaway was serving as a U.S. attorney. She said Democrats are cautiously optimistic about the change in leadership.
Bailey resigned to become co-deputy director of the FBI. His two predecessors — Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt — resigned early, too, for seats in the U.S. Senate. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe appointed Hanaway with the expectation she will be the first attorney general in more than a decade to stick around for more than an election cycle. Hanaway vowed when she was announced as attorney general to serve out the rest of Bailey’s term and seek a full term of her own in 2028. 
“The leadership capacity that she brings to the attorney general’s office, I would say, is second to none, and the breadth of her experience is second to none,” said John Hancock, a veteran GOP consultant and former party leader. “I fully expect that she’s going to be a remarkable attorney general.”
 Longtime Missouri attorney, politician

Catherine Hanaway talks to reporters on Aug. 19 after being announced as the state’s next attorney general (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Hanaway’s journey began as a grassroots effort.
“She was a suburban woman who basically started by going door to door and helped shift the majority in Missouri,” said Jean Evans, a former GOP lawmaker from St. Louis County who also served as leader of the state party. 
After graduating from The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law, Hanaway kicked off her career at a big law firm. Not long after, at the age of 34 and with a 6-month-old in tow, she was elected to the Missouri House. 
Her career as a lawmaker was marked by Missouri’s shift to a Republican majority. After working as the House minority leader, Hanaway was part of the Republican celebrations in 2002 when Republicans took the majority after 48 years of Democratic control. Hanaway became the first — and so far, only — woman speaker of the Missouri House. 
“When you enter the legislature, her name is like the gold standard of what it takes to be a leader in the Republican Party,” Evans said.
She ran unsuccessfully for Missouri secretary of state in 2004. The next year, President George W. Bush appointed Hanaway to be U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. 
While the job requires coordination with the FBI, Secret Service and DEA, Hanaway said she made a point of connecting with law enforcement in the 47 counties outside of St. Louis that were also under her jurisdiction because “their taxpayers deserve the same level of service that people in downtown St. Louis got.”
In that role, Hanaway’s office was particularly focused on devoting more resources child exploitation cases, prosecuting those who manufactured methamphetamine and punishing Medicaid and Medicare fraud. 
She also oversaw the prosecution of Michael Devlin, who was found guilty of abducting and abusing two boys in St. Louis County. It’s a case that’s stayed with her this past decade. And an example of ways she said she can help individual Missourians find justice.
“I can’t think of anybody that’s come into that position with a better pedigree,” said Hancock, noting the significance of her time managing large public and private sector legal teams as she takes over an office that has struggled with recruitment and retention. 
She ran again for statewide office in 2016, losing in the GOP gubernatorial primary to the man who would go on to be governor, Eric Greitens. 
When Greitens was facing impeachment and criminal charges a little more than a year later, Hanway joined his legal team. 
“I didn’t defend Eric personally,” Hanaway said Monday. “I represented his campaign and his 501c4 which meant that there were a whole lot of young staffers and other people who were getting investigated, interviewed by law enforcement authorities, and I was really providing representation to them. I’m glad that none of those people ended up with any penalties. I’m proud that I was able to defend them.”
Until her appointment as attorney general, Hanaway was a partner at Husch Blackwell in St. Louis. 
There, she was lead counsel representing Grain Belt Express — a planned transmission line designed to take wind farm-generated electricity across the Midwest  under investigation by the attorney general’s office. The company filed a lawsuit accusing Bailey’s office of an “unlawful and politically motivated investigation.” 
Hanaway, who is recusing herself from the case, said there’s not much she can comment on regarding Grain Belt. 
 A change in leadership

Both Republicans and Democrats are hopeful Hanaway can finally bring stability to the attorney general’s office.
“I can’t think of any attorney general in the history of Missouri who has had more experience than Hanaway in running a big law firm,” said Chuck Hatfield, a longtime Democratic attorney who called Hanaway’s resume in leadership “unmatched” and her network “amazing.”
Hatfield, who is often tapped to argue high-profile cases against the attorney general’s office,  said Hanaway’s experience will likely prove valuable in an office that’s had regular issues with turnover and morale.
Most recently, Bailey faced criticism that he mismanaged the office, resulting in missed deadlines and staff turnover — including from some of the highest profile lawyers in the office. 
“I’m quite optimistic that we’re going to see the quality of the legal work improve,” Hatfield said, adding: “The attorney general needs to be the spokesperson for the state in court, and the court needs to think that they’re very credible and that the attorney general is always going to have something worth saying.”
New Missouri attorney general inherits more than 120 pending Sunshine Law requests

Hanaway said she hopes to make the office even more appealing to attorneys, citing the frequency with which attorneys from the office go on to become judges.
“If this is a place where you can come and get qualified to be a judge, that’s pretty cool,” she said. “So the quality of the people here, I think, is really at an all time high, and we do need more of them.”
She also commended her three predecessors on focusing on recruiting top talent for constitutional cases. 
“Where you might see a little bit of a shift from me is not at all on which issues we’re doing,” she said, “it’s to focus a little bit more on the career people who do everything else in the office.”
Hanaway promised to continue Bailey’s fight against public corruption, saying that she will prioritize his cases against St. Louis Sheriff Alfred Montgomery and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page.
Hanaway said she is considering lending assistant attorneys general to jurisdictions she believes need help, including in Kansas City. She also plans to go after “Delta-8,” an intoxicating hemp product that she and others have said are being sold unlicensed and with no age restrictions in gas stations across the state.
Bailey has said that winning a $24 billion judgement against the Chinese Communist Party for the spread of COVID-19 is one of his biggest accomplishments. Hanaway said she is committed to figuring out what assets of the Chinese government can be collected on behalf of Missourians.
Bailey’s office was also aggressive in its attacks on abortion. Hanaway pointed to an ongoing lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood against the state that challenges current abortion regulations, also known as TRAP laws, as the most important abortion-related case before her.
“I support the law that is currently on the books in Missouri,” she said. “ …  we just want to do everything that we can to protect life and to support women who make that really difficult choice to keep an unexpected pregnancy.”
Hanaway grew up in Nebraska and Iowa, but has long been a Missourian. 
She said Missourians are the state motto — “show me” — personified. 
“People are just real, and they don’t have a tolerance for you being fake,” Hanaway said. “I love that, and you got to prove it to them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/54774073341_c5eef6e9dd_k-e1757371207765-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-09 06:56:55.153683

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)A Republican bill that seeks to stop Wisconsin from using public funds to support health services for immigrants who lack legal authorization to reside in the U.S. is poised to advance on Tuesday. 
The bill — AB 308 — would prohibit state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the U.S.
It is the latest bill that Republican lawmakers have introduced targeting immigrants. Another bill introduced and passed earlier this year seeks to require local law enforcement officers to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The bill is coauthored by Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan) and Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) and currently has 25 other Republican cosponsors. No Democrats are signed onto the bill. 
During the bill hearing last week, Dallman focused mostly on Wisconsin’s Medicaid program, BadgerCare, arguing that he wants to prevent the state from ever taking steps similar to Minnesota and other states that expanded their Medicaid programs to cover immigrants who lack legal status. Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal authorization to apply to BadgerCare.
In 2023, Minnesota expanded its Medicaid program to cover residents without citizenship or legal residency status, but that was repealed after Republicans threatened a government shutdown to force Democrats to eliminate the expansion. 
The cost estimate for the program was nearly $200 million, Dallman noted.
“These are enormous price tags for individuals who are not here lawfully. This condition should not be the case here in Wisconsin with a state budget that is currently already very lean,” Dallman said. “We must prioritize our citizens over those who are here unlawfully. While Wisconsin currently does not allow undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare, this bill preemptively… ensures that Wisconsin does not become like Minnesota or Illinois.”
Dallman noted that the bill includes a carve out to ensure that it won’t lose Wisconsin money or put it out of step with federal law.
According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau summary, the prohibitions in the bill would not apply to the extent that a payment is required under federal law or the application of the prohibitions would result in the loss of any federal funds.
“This bill is not about immigration,” Dallman said, but it is about “protecting our constituents and their hard-earned tax dollars that they send into our state.”
In written testimony, Wanggaard said the bill would extend the current restrictions to “all other health services paid for by the State of Wisconsin.” Wanggaard, who did not attend the public hearing, wrote that the bill would ensure Wisconsin “is not the next test dummy extending health benefits to illegal aliens.”
Democrats and advocates said they are concerned about the sweeping effects the bill could have on all Wisconsinites. 
William Parke-Sutherland, government affairs director at Kids Forward, said the bill would be unworkable as law and would affect every health care provider in the state.
“This bill is entirely short sighted, and nobody has thought about how this would create a state in which we do not want to live,” Parke-Sutherland said. “If a child is at the school and is sick, does the school nurse need to figure out how to verify their status before they provide any degree of care?… I just don’t think that people have thought through the consequences of us in Wisconsin having to live in a situation where we all need to carry our papers.” 
Parke-Sutherland noted that there are already strict citizenship requirements people need to meet to enroll in nearly all Medicaid programs.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) outlines the restrictions on its website as well as  two programs available to noncitizens. One is Medicaid Emergency Services, which provides short-term medical coverage for people who have a medical emergency and aren’t eligible for BadgerCare Plus or Wisconsin Medicaid, and the other is BadgerCare Plus Prenatal Plan, which provides health care coverage for pregnant mothers who are not eligible for BadgerCare Plus due to immigration status or being in prison or jail.
“This is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist, and it’s creating way, way, way more problems,” Parke-Sutherland said. “If you are creating a situation where you’re prohibiting funding for services for people who are unlawfully present, then you are creating a need for people to verify their status in order to receive health care.” 
In a fiscal analysis, the Department of Corrections said it is concerned the bill could violate the 8th Amendment. A 1976 Supreme Court decision in Estelle v. Gamble established that the deliberate failure to deal with an inmate’s medical needs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. 
Wanggaard refuted the analysis in written testimony, saying the bill language means it would only apply to state programs that require enrollment. 
“It does not mean that, for example, an illegal immigrant in the state prison system could not receive health care services from DOC,” Wanggaard said. 
The language of the bill, however, says that “no funds of this state or of any county, village, town, or long-term care district… and no federal funds passing through the state treasury shall be authorized for or paid to any person to subsidize, reimburse, or otherwise provide compensation for any health care services for an individual who is not lawfully present in the United States.”
Rep. Karen Kirsch (D-Greenfield) said her Republican colleagues are taking a page from President Donald Trump and his administration by downplaying the effect of the bill. 
“They’re watching how Trump handles things,” Kirsch said. “They’re pushing the envelope on every interpretation of every word and every piece of legislation to go target people, to go after people… They’re watching how he handles things, and I think that they’re mimicking that at the state. They’re trying to make it sound like, ‘Well, this is all so reasonable. This is not a big deal. Don’t worry about it.’ And then if it passes, then we’re going to see it’s way… way worse.”
Kirsch said she is concerned about the potential “chilling effect” that the bill could have, discouraging individuals and families from seeking care when they need it. 
“[Republicans are] trying to raise this to the public consciousness, and then people are going to be confused,” Kirsch said. “‘Is this a way that they’re going to find me, if I’m an undocumented person?… Even if I do qualify for care, maybe something’s going to happen to me?’ It can have this overall chilling effect of confusion of whether or not people feel safe enough to get care.”
Kirsch took issue with the argument that the bill would protect taxpayers’ money. 
“When they do have access to health care, that also keeps our health care prices down because they’re not showing up in our emergency rooms, they’re doing preventative care, they’re taking care of their diabetes, and they’re not showing up with some serious diabetes complication in our emergency room,” Kirsch said. 
Kirsch also noted that undocumented immigrants pay sales tax and contribute to the state’s economy. She referenced a 2024 report from the University of Wisconsin School for Workers that found that undocumented immigrants specifically contributed $240 million in state and local taxes in 2022.
According to the Wisconsin Lobbying website, the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, Inc., Kids Forward, the Wisconsin chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, the Wisconsin Association of School Nurses and the Wisconsin Council of Churches are registered against the bill. The only group registered in favor is FGA Action, a Florida-based nonprofit that advocates for conservative policies in statehouses around the country.
David Gwidt, Deputy Communications Director for the ACLU of Wisconsin, said in a statement to the Examiner that the legislation if enacted “could result in absurd circumstances for medical and mental health providers across the state and exacerbate this fear and uncertainty experienced by our immigrant neighbors.” 
The Assembly State Affairs Committee plans to vote on whether to advance the legislation Tuesday, setting it up for a floor vote later this week.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Another trial in the killing of 17-year-old Alvin Cole by then-Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensah began Monday, with attorneys battling over whether Mensah used excessive force when he killed Cole following a foot chase in 2020. U.S. District Court Judge Lynn Adelman is presiding over the case, as he did when the case went to trial earlier this year, ending in a hung jury. Mensah has claimed that Cole pointed a gun in his direction, making him fear for his life and triggering his decision to fire five shots at Cole.  
An all-white, eight-member jury was selected out of a pool of 36 potential jurors, with an even split of men and women. None of the jurors are from Milwaukee. Two indicated that they have close relatives who served in law enforcement, though they said this would not sway their decision-making. 
Attorney Kimberley Motley, representing Cole and his family, used a projection screen to display a photo of Cole when he was younger. She told jurors that sometimes kids do stupid things, which in this case was running from the police, but also that running alone does not give grounds for officers to use deadly force. “Some kids ran faster, some kids ran slower, and Alvin was one of the slower kids,” Motley said. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Motley noted that Mensah was not the first officer on the scene. Yet he was the only officer to fire. She stressed to the jury that Mensah, not Cole, “is the only one on trial,” and that jurors can acknowledge that police have a hard job while also finding that Mensah used excessive force. 
Cole was Mensah’s third shooting over a five-year period at Wauwatosa PD, a fact not shared with jurors. In his opening statement, attorney Joseph Wirth told jurors that foot chases are incredibly dangerous and unpredictable and that Cole made “catastrophically bad” decisions and “the escalation of danger” was “enormous”. After firing a gun he was carrying, Wirth said Cole went into a crouch-like position, fired at Olson, and then turned towards Mensah before he was killed. One of the key issues in the case has been conflicting statements from police officers on the scene, with Mensah saying the gun was only pointed at him, Officer David Shamsi (who was closest to Cole), saying the gun hadn’t moved at all, and Officer Even Olson saying that the gun was pointed towards him and away from Mensah. 
“Sympathy for loss of life can exist at the same time as your duty as a juror to uphold the law,” Wirth told the jurors. He asked them to “clear your minds of sympathy” and reiterated that “Alvin Cole made catastrophically bad decisions.”
Both civilian and law enforcement witnesses were called to the stand Monday, beginning with UW-Milwaukee film and documentary teacher Sean Kafer, who’d reviewed squad and deposition videos for the trial. Kafer testified that he added a red circle to a version of the squad video depicting the shooting, and removed background noise. The video was played multiple times for jurors. Wirth also played versions of the squad video. The low quality of the video was one of the issues noted by the jurors who failed to reach a unanimous decision in the last trial. 
Shamsi, now an FBI agent and a major in the U.S. Army Reserve with combat experience, was working overtime the night of the shooting. He was among the officers who “floated” to the area in case they were needed. 
After the first shot went off, Shamsi testified that Cole ended up on his hands and knees, with the firearm still in his right hand. Mensah came from behind Shamsi, who said that he did not see Cole turn or take a shooter’s stance as Wirth said in opening statements.
Video from Shamsi’s squad car was also played capturing him talking to other officers, including investigators from the Milwaukee Police Department who’d come to take his statement. In those videos, Shamsi can be heard saying “he was crawling” and that Shamsi was right next to “dude” when the shooting happened. When asked about Cole aiming the gun, Shamsi said, “I did not see it move.” Shamsi cautioned, though, that the situation was chaotic and rapid, and that he may not have noticed everything. He added that it was a deadly situation, and that he was prepared to fire if needed. 
Shenora Statten-Jordan, a principal at Messmer High School testified that she was leaving a Mayfair-area restaurant when the shooting happened. Driving her white SUV beside her husband and two children in the back, Statten-Jordan testified to seeing lights and commotion near the Cheesecake Factory parking lot. As her vehicle approached she could see other officers responding, hear the shots, and see a boy fall to the ground onto his stomach with his legs still kicking “as if he was still running.” 
Wirth attempted to establish, as he’d done in the last trial, that Statten-Jordan was not in a position to actually see the shooting. Video from Shamsi’s dash camera and a passing Milwaukee County bus, however, showed that Statten-Jordan was where she’d testified she was. After witnessing the shooting, she was interviewed by the Greenfield Police Department as part of the shooting investigation. Statten-Jordan said she’d offered to go back to the scene with officers, but that they didn’t take her up on the offer.
The last witness of the day was Wauwatosa officer Jeffrey Johnson, who left his own patrol sector to respond to the mall that day. Johnson recalled meeting Shamsi, chasing the teens and hearing the shots that ended Cole’s life. Johnson testified that Cole had fallen to his hands and knees, and that from his position 20-25 yards away that he, like Shamsi, did not see Cole move. Nor did Johnson fire his weapon, although he drew it after the first shot was fired. Johnson said that although he didn’t see Cole move while on the ground, a lot was going on. Johnson said that officer training does not require a gun to be pointed at you to justify firing. 
The trial is expected to last until late Wednesday or early Thursday, when the case will be turned over for deliberations. Dr. Weislaw Tlomak, Chief Medical Officer of the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, is expected to begin testimony Tuesday.

New study shows deer avoid cheatgrass-covered areas, but authors also provide hope.
The post Mule deer could lose half their northeast Wyoming habitat to cheatgrass without help appeared first on WyoFile .","When thin shoots of cheatgrass are the first plants to green up in the spring, mule deer might nibble the tops like any of us might idly crunch last week’s pretzels still sitting on our office desks. 
Come early summer, though, that same cheatgrass turns into brown, leggy strands. At that point, mule deer want to eat it as much as we want to consume the cardboard box containing those stale pretzels. They just won’t do it. 
In fact, they dislike cheatgrass so much that mule deer will avoid an area completely once it contains about 20% of the annual invasive grass, according to a study published in early September in the journal Rangeland Ecology and Management. 
The study’s authors, all from the University of Wyoming, compared movement patterns from 115 GPS-collared mule deer with range maps showing variation in plant cover. They found that when cheatgrass covers less than 10% of an area, deer will still browse. When it covers 10-16%, they will begin to avoid an area. Anything above 20% is utterly unappealing.

Even more alarmingly, the study shows that as cheatgrass continues to spread in northeast Wyoming over the next couple decades, up to 50% of current good habitat could be rendered useless to mule deer. 
The spread of cheatgrass likely won’t be the final nail in mule deer’s coffin, but it will be one of many contributing to their continued decline. Unlike many studies that focus exclusively on declines, however, this one carries a rather large kernel of hope. When treating cheatgrass with herbicides in a targeted and strategic way, land managers can start to win the fight and mule deer will also return. 
A perpetual plague
Cheatgrass has been the scourge of western landscapes for well over a century, when it first arrived from Europe and Asia nestled in bags of seed and bales of straw. Like most nonnative, invasive grasses, it didn’t evolve here and quickly found a way to outcompete its native neighbors. It “cheats,” germinating over winter to be the first grass to grow in the spring, using water and resources before native grasses, plants and shrubs are awake enough from their winter slumber to start looking for nourishment again. 
But by early summer, cheatgrass cures, losing any trace amounts of nutritional value. It becomes a fire hazard, another part of its evolutionary strategy. As fires whip across a landscape, aided by dry cheatgrass, the blazes kill native competitors, giving cheatgrass even more opportunities to spread. 
It’s a problem that has plagued ranchers, wildlife biologists and land managers for decades, but until recently, few publications had explicitly shown at what threshold mule deer will simply avoid cheatgrass-covered areas.

UW professors Jerod Merkle and Brian Mealor along with research scientist Kurt Smith used data showing how mule deer acted in much of the northeast corner of the state, provided by Western EcoSystems Technology biologist Hall Sawyer. The researchers could see deer collar points move into and out of areas with good food and habitat and avoid those areas with increasing amounts of cheatgrass. 
Jill Randall, Wyoming Game and Fish Department big game migration coordinator, who was not involved in the study, said the results make sense. 
“Deer are super selective foragers, and if they can choose between native and non-native, they will go where there’s something better,” she said. “If cheatgrass is scattered in and among things, they will nibble, but 20% or above is pretty dominant. If they can go elsewhere and eat other native species, they will.”
The problem then becomes when deer start to run out of other places to go. 
Hope for conservation
Losing half their potential habitat in the next 20 years sounds dramatic. And it is, especially for a herd already suffering from energy development, highways, fences and drought.
But solutions exist, the authors say, particularly in an herbicide called Rejuvra, which was approved by the EPA in 2020 and is being used on rangelands across the West. 
The herbicide works by killing annual seeds and leaving perennial grasses and plants relatively untouched. It’s expensive, Randall said, and requires repeated treatments. But she and many other experts say it’s critical for maintaining sagebrush ecosystems upon which countless mule deer, sagegrouse, songbirds and even lizards depend.

A study published in August used camera traps to show that mule deer will return to areas with native plants after cheatgrass removal. 
That’s also what Smith, Merkle and Mealor’s models showed. In fact, mule deer will return in abundance following treatment of cheatgrass-covered acres, potentially reversing much of that 50% of habitat that was otherwise lost. 
The authors say the paper isn’t meant to cause alarm but to explain the direness of the situation and hopefulness of potential solutions. 
Gov. Mark Gordon and state lawmakers agree, and earlier this year, provided tens of millions of dollars in grants and loans to fight invasive grasses. 
Bottom line, Smith said: “If we do nothing, we’re in trouble. But there is hope.”

Legislators need to hear from workers who can’t set down roots in communities where it’s hard to find a place to live, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Wyoming’s investment in affordable housing is worth the fight appeared first on WyoFile .","Here’s a fundamental question Wyoming lawmakers keep ignoring at the state’s peril: What kind of a future do we have when workers can’t find anywhere they can afford to live?

Opinion

I know it pales in comparison to subjects the Legislature spends so much time on, like determining what bathrooms people can use, banning library books that mention sex and erecting more barriers to voting.
But the affordable housing crisis is destined to get worse if lawmakers don’t find the political will to act now. Combined with two other major Wyoming problems — lack of affordable health care and our state’s frustrating inability to provide adequate and constitutionally mandated school funding for all students — it’s taking a huge toll on our economy and well-being.
The Legislature has had ample opportunities to address these issues, but has noticeably devoted the least attention to housing.
A grassroots group wants legislators to focus on Wyoming’s affordable housing crisis and do something that’s been effective in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico. 
Only Wyoming and Mississippi haven’t created a state housing trust fund.
The Wyoming Housing Investment Alliance is gathering signatures on a letter of support to send to the Legislature so it will consider a housing bill that the extremist Freedom Caucus didn’t even deem worthy of an introduction vote during this year’s general session. 
The Legislature needs to be forcefully pushed in that direction. A Wyoming Community Development Association report last year found there’s not a single county in Wyoming where a family earning their county’s median income can afford a typical home in their community.
That should be a shocking statistic, but Wyomingites understand it all too well. The lack of good-paying jobs in most sectors other than the minerals industry has long pushed young people to leave the state to find employment.


But now those who have jobs and want to stay — including such bedrock occupations like teachers, nurses and government workers — pack their bags and flee to proverbial greener pastures because they can’t find an affordable place to live.
One factor is an influx of older people moving here from out of state who can afford to spend more on housing. Long-time residents find limited and more expensive housing stock if they want to upgrade, so they stay where they are, leaving fewer “starter homes” on the market for young families.
There are also few financial incentives for developers to construct less expensive housing with much lower profit margins.
“Lack of affordable housing is stifling our economy and making it hard for working-class families to establish roots,” Rep. Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, told me in an interview earlier this year. “If we want our young people to stay and grow the economy, the state must invest in housing.”
A bill that would have put $15 million into a state housing trust fund in 2023 never made it out of committee. 
This year, Sherwood sponsored her own measure to create a $20 million housing investment fund that has the potential to make a significant impact on affordable housing problems statewide. It’s the bill the new Wyoming Housing Investment Alliance wants to resurrect, because the Freedom Caucus that controls the House’s agenda had neither the good sense nor courage to let it be debated.
Sherwood’s bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Evie Brennan, R-Cheyenne, would allow Wyoming nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity and the Wyoming Housing Network to be eligible to receive half of the funds through grants and zero-interest loans for new construction, repairs and rehabilitation, transitional housing, first-time homebuyer assistance, and rental voucher programs.
For-profit businesses could apply for up to 45% of the funds available through a low-interest revolving loan fund for new construction, repairs and rehabilitation.
These components are what the National Low Income Housing Coalition stressed in a June report examining the 843 housing trust funds established across the country. They target a wide range of housing problems in rural and urban areas, from helping young people buy their first home to assisting the most marginalized renters who need safe, decent, affordable and accessible housing.
The details can be tweaked, which should appeal to lawmakers who insist that whatever the problem is, it requires a “Wyoming solution.” That old chestnut has probably killed bills clear back to the first days of statehood in 1890, because it’s something lawmakers love to say but rarely know how to accomplish.
But it needn’t be the death knell for the housing issue. 
Trust funds have been effective pretty much everywhere they’ve been tried in states, cities and counties. Many states have used trust fund legislation to empower local governments to set up their own trusts to tailor affordable housing development to unique community needs. Enacted here, it would create a set of de facto “Wyoming solutions.”
Lawmakers who don’t want to create a huge bureaucracy to deal with affordable housing should be encouraged by the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s report. More than half of housing trust funds are managed by one to three staff members, and about one-third had an annual administrative budget of less than $50,000.
Sherwood and Brennan told the Sheridan Press that while Wyoming’s leaders like to talk about economic development and diversifying the economy, the bottom line is the state needs a workforce.
“In order to have that workforce, we have to have affordable housing,” Brennan said. “We cannot keep our children here or attract new families if we don’t have the infrastructure. Affordable housing is part of that infrastructure needed for our communities and state to thrive.”
The pair has an even steeper hill to climb at next year’s budget session. This year’s bill only needed a simple majority to be considered, but in 2026, it will take a two-thirds supermajority to be introduced.
I’m glad to see the public lobbying for the state to make a strong commitment to invest in housing. Lawmakers need to hear directly from people whose lives have been upended by their inability to find an affordable place to buy or rent.
Whenever you hear legislators try to steer the conversation to some hot-button cultural issue, disarm them with a real-world problem about housing. You’ll be fighting for Wyoming’s future.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun) The night his daughter died, Allen Hodges said he didn’t know the law.
After Kylie, 16, was taking a while in the bath, he went in to check on her and found her unresponsive on Dec. 19, 2020.
He called 911 and started CPR. But he soon realized she’d had a tonic seizure, a more severe type that had been flaring up for Kylie, who had epilepsy.
Paramedics arrived. They tried to save her, then asked if they should keep going. Hodges said they shouldn’t.
Then a local sheriff’s deputy escorted him out of his house in Caldwell, which was apparently being treated as a crime scene even though he had told first responders about his daughter’s history with epilepsy. 
After Kylie was declared dead, Hodges dressed her and carried her to a funeral home car, he recalled recently. 
“I didn’t even have a chance to grieve that night,” Hodges said in an interview, sitting in his office next to a photo of his daughter, and a flower she drew on his whiteboard in his office.
Worried that nude photos of his dead daughter could be released publicly after a watchdog report found corner records aren’t confidential, Hodges pushed for a bill in the Legislature this year to clarify privacy protections for death investigation records. The bill, introduced late in the legislative session, stalled and didn’t pass. 
But Sen. Melissa Wintrow, the Democratic state lawmaker from Boise who led that bill and a separate successful coroner reform law, said she plans to bring the privacy bill again next year. She’s working with local coroners on more fixes, like she did last year. 
Years after Kylie died, Hodges said he’s fighting for his daughter’s dignity and other parents’ rights as he pursues reforms to Idaho’s troubled coroner system — in court and through the Legislature. He shared accounts of his daughter’s death investigation in interviews with the Idaho Capital Sun and in lawsuits he recently filed against Canyon County officials.

 Officials won’t share, or delete photos, Canyon County prosecutor says

In the lawsuits, in which he’s representing himself, Hodges has asked courts to require local officials to destroy and give back what he claims are unwarranted, nude photos of his dead daughter, and compensate him for what he alleges are civil rights violations.
“People need to be aware that the process is not on a level playing field from county to county. And the state legislators need to fix the broken system,” he said. 
Canyon County officials say an investigation into his daughter’s death — when no doctor was present — was warranted. And they say officials won’t release photos from the death investigation, but they won’t destroy them. 
“The records with which Mr. Hodges is concerned are protected and will not be disclosed publicly,” Canyon County Prosecuting Attorney Christopher Boyd told the Sun in a letter in July. “… Unless authorized by law, reports related to unattended deaths are generally never destroyed and remain the property of the County’s investigatory law enforcement agencies. Thus, any requests to destroy investigatory records absent legal authority will be denied and those records preserved.”
A watchdog report that spurred the recent push to reform Idaho’s coroner system found that state law “does not prevent a coroner from sharing information” gathered in a death investigation. And it recommended lawmakers take up the issue to “lessen the chance of impeding a criminal investigation” and respect families’ privacy.
Kylie’s death was ruled natural, according to her death certificate.
 As lawmakers worked to revamp Idaho’s coroner system, Hodges shared the story of his daughter’s death

In Idaho, coroners are an elected, county-level position, as outlined in the state’s constitution.
This spring — after a critical watchdog report in 2024 by the Office of Performance Evaluations found inconsistencies in death investigations across Idaho, driven by sparse guidance in state law — the Idaho Legislature widely passed into law a bill to clarify the roles of coroners and law enforcement in death investigations. 
Gov. Little signs bill that will reform the roles Idaho coroners have in death investigations

Debating in the Idaho Senate, Wintrow called the bill a first step that was “a long time coming.” She referenced decades of failed attempts to reform Idaho’s coroner system, which a ProPublica investigation last year detailed. 
In February, when that bill was in its early stages, Hodges testified before a legislative committee about his daughter’s death — and the need for privacy protections for coroner records.
“After I did all the CPR (and) informed him of her epilepsy, the deputy coroner on the scene and the (detective) seized her medicine. They told me, ‘You didn’t do anything wrong, but that deputy is going to escort you outside of your house, and this has turned into a crime scene,’” Hodges, who serves as president of the Idaho Trucking Association but was appearing as a parent, told lawmakers.
“They took nude photos of my daughter,” he told the committee. “I have no control over those photographs at all — because there’s no law in Idaho.”
A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2004 allows autopsy images to be withheld from public release. The watchdog report found information coroners gather in death investigations “is not considered confidential.” 
The report, by the Office of Performance Evaluations, recommended the Legislature consider updating state law “to include regulations on confidentiality of information gathered by coroners in a death investigation”
Without a clear understanding about confidentiality requirements, “each coroner just kind of does their own thing,” Office of Performance Evaluations Director Ryan Langrill told the Sun.
“My read of the law is that there are no exemptions whatsoever, except for records that are protected through some secondary law,” such as privacy protections for personnel or police records, he said. 
Last month, as law enforcement released troves of information from the investigation into a quadruple murder in Moscow, KTVB published blurred photos from the crime scene, which the outlet received through a public records request from local police. The Boise-based TV station was the only Idaho news outlet to publish the photos, and families were not notified before they were released, the Spokesman-Review reported.
KTVB could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Idaho State Association of County Coroners President Torey Danner said Idaho doesn’t have many public record protections for coroner records. But he said he thinks that should change.

“Unfortunately, there just are certain things that I don’t believe need to be made public. One family’s tragedy should not be another family’s entertainment,” said Danner, who is also Bannock County’s coroner. 
Late in the legislative session this year, Wintrow introduced another bill, Senate Bill 1135, that aimed to address Hodges’ privacy concerns. But she soon pulled the bill from consideration this year, realizing it went too far in concealing coroner records after an investigative journalist from ProPublica contacted her for a story on the bill.
In late 2024, ProPublica’s reporting highlighted gaps in Idaho’s coroner system. Then in March, the investigative news outlet reported that the privacy protection bill could “shield from public view records that ProPublica relied on in its coverage.”
“When you’re drafting a bill right in legislative session, when you’re being pulled in 1,000 directions, you could try to write something, and that’s what we did,” said Wintrow, a Boise Democrat who co-chairs the state’s Legislative Oversight Committee that ordered the state’s watchdog report on the coroner system.
But she soon realized it would make more records private than she wanted. “So that’s why I put the brakes on and said, ‘No, we don’t do bad legislation,’” Wintrow said.
She said she thinks the solution would be to treat coroner records like law enforcement records under the state’s Public Record Act, so journalists could still access some coroner records, but not all. 
Hodges says he worries everyday about pictures of his daughter ending up online. 
“Is that fair to a parent?” he told the Sun. 
 Online coroner training had nude photos of dead bodies. It’s no longer publicly available.

In April, before Hodges asked Canyon County to delete photos of his daughter, he found photos of nude and partially dressed dead people published online in a training for Idaho coroners on the Idaho Association of Counties’ website. The training on death investigation photography — which is no longer publicly available — credited Ada County for the presentation. 
In May, when the Idaho Capital Sun contacted Ada County Coroner Rich Riffle about the photos, he said in an email he would address it immediately and that he didn’t review the presentation beforehand. The presentation was intended to be used professionally, not by the public, he said.
The Association of Counties made the training only available to coroners, the association’s policy adviser Kelli Brassfield told the Sun in an email.
Ada County doesn’t seek permission from families to use materials in presentations or use active cases, Riffle, the coroner, said. 
“The great care taken is in the redaction of the photographs – to include such things as any family photos on a wall in the background,” he said. “… Even with this due diligence in redactions, our presenters make it clear up front that the attendees will see pictures that may be disturbing, and that they are local cases so there may be a chance someone will recognize the case even with all the details of any potential identifying images carefully redacted.”
The images in the training, reviewed by the Sun, showed two unredacted nude bodies. A female whose breasts were exposed had a block box over her eyes. Photos of a male, fully undressed on a gurney, did not appear to have redactions.
In May, Hodges asked Canyon County officials to delete photos of his daughter.
Boyd, the local prosecutor, told Hodges that when he talked to Canyon County Coroner Jennifer Crawford, she told him “her process would never be to release photos of any investigation under the Public Records Act.”
Christopher Boyd, serving as a special prosecutor for the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, argues in court in this file photo in February 2024. (Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
“In my discussion with the Coroner, she has assured me that she has not disclosed anything of a sensitive nature including photos which is not required by law,” Boyd wrote to Hodges, according to a copy of the letter the Sun obtained through a public records request. “I understand you have requested to have the photos of the autopsy provided to you and for the Coroner to not keep any of those images. I will reach out to her and forward your request.”
“Again, I am sorry for your loss and hope that the legislative changes you are requesting are ultimately adopted,” Boyd wrote at the end of the letter.
In June, Hodges filed a tort claim with the county, which is precursor to a lawsuit. Then he filed lawsuits against Canyon County law enforcement and coroner officials in state and federal courts. He is legally representing himself in the lawsuits.
 Working with coroners and law enforcement, Idaho lawmakers are working toward more coroner legislation. But funding is a barrier.

Idaho’s new law clarifying death investigation roles only addressed some of the litany of recommendations in the watchdog report. 
The report, nearly 100 pages, also found:

Idaho had the lowest autopsy rate in the nation for deaths of children and homicides, and the third lowest rate for death autopsies overall.
It’s unclear if coroners are even fulfilling the 24-hours of training required every two years.
State expenses for coroner offices was “a minor fraction of overall county budgets,” and many coroner offices’ ability to operate is hampered by lacking “essential resources and equipment.”

In the months after the legislative session ended in spring, Wintrow and other state lawmakers have been meeting with coroners and law enforcement as part of a work group to craft future legislation. One proposal the group has considered could require autopsies for children, Boise State Public Radio reported.
But to Wintrow, the biggest hurdle in addressing more of the watchdog report’s findings is figuring out how to fund coroner offices better. That’s where the Legislature can step in, especially to help smaller counties, Wintrow said. 
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, asks a question during a Senate Health and Welfare Committee hearing on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
But she wishes the Legislature wouldn’t have cut the state’s revenue so much this year, when lawmakers approved $400 million in tax cuts and $50 million in tax credits for parents who send their kids to private schools. 
“That has put us in a pickle,” Wintrow said in July.
Last month, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state government agencies besides public schools to cut their budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall. But the budget shortfall estimate didn’t account for tax cuts in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement, the Sun reported. 
In response to a follow-up survey this year by the state watchdog agency, the Office of Performance Evaluations, some coroners said “the lack of dedicated funding prevents them from obtaining necessary equipment, securing full-time staff, and increasing autopsy capacity.”

“The coroner system in Idaho is broken and a joke,” one unnamed coroner replied to the survey. 
That was part of a trend of local coroners wanting the state to step in, ProPublica recently reported. 
 Lawsuit claims death investigation wasn’t warranted. Canyon County Prosecutor disputes that.

In his lawsuit in state court, Hodges asked the court to order government agencies to destroy any nude or graphic photos of his dead daughter and return the original photos to family, alleging that the photos were obtained without legal justification. 
In his federal lawsuit, he alleges a slew of civil rights violations — many of which revolve around his claim that the county’s investigation into his daughter’s death was not legally justified.
In his state court lawsuit, Hodges cites two Idaho laws as recognizing “that not all deaths require a law enforcement response, particularly when there is no indication of foul play and the medical circumstances are understood.”
“In the case of my daughter, who had a known medical disease and had recently been seen by her physician, these protections were disregarded,” Hodges argues in his legal complaint. “Despite her established medical condition and the presence of a treating physician who could have certified her death, no effort was made to contact her doctor. Instead, the authorities proceeded with a criminal investigation, treating the scene as suspicious without medical justification.”
Citing a report from paramedics, Hodges told the Sun paramedics talked with a doctor about Kylie’s care while they were trying to resuscitate her. In his lawsuit, he claims coroner staff failed to apply an exemption in Idaho law that he claims doesn’t require investigations into children’s deaths if they have a known medical condition.
Asked about Hodges’ lawsuits, Canyon County spokesperson Aaron Williams denied wrongdoing or disclosing any confidential information, but declined to comment more on the issues raised in the lawsuits. 
“Canyon County follows any and all current laws regarding public record requests,” he said.
Boyd previously has said a law enforcement investigation into Hodges’ daughter’s death was warranted.
In his May letter to Hodges, Boyd cited an Idaho law that requires coroners refer death investigations to local law enforcement “if a death occurs that is not attended by a physician and the cause of death cannot be certified by a physician.”
“In this matter, EMT’s were called to the scene to assist in attempts at resuscitation,” Boyd wrote. “Under the law, the presence of EMTs does not equate to a death occurring in the presence of a physician and therefore an investigation was warranted.”
Looking back on the night his daughter died, Hodges said he has one regret.
“It may sound incorrect, but because after what I went through, I wish I’d never called for help,” he said. “If I couldn’t have saved her on my own, we could’ve just buried her on the property and had the pastor come over and had a ceremony.”
He doesn’t want other parents to go through what he did.
“Being investigated as a suspect or whatever — that, that sticks with you,” he said.

(Photo: Rob Colvin)The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency is potentially a few months away from purchasing about 7,500 acres of land along the Hatchie River for conservation and outdoor recreation.
The property spans Haywood, Hardeman and Madison counties in West Tennessee and includes ecologically valuable wetlands marked as a priority for conservation.
“This acquisition will secure the protection of sensitive wetlands and unique wildlife habitat while adding a large amount of huntable land, according to information presented to the State Building Commissions’ executive subcommittee.
While this property is a longstanding area of interest for wildlife conservation and outdoor recreation plans from years past, its acquisition would also secure protection of key wetlands following the April passage of a bill that rolled back regulations for about 80% of the Tennessee wetlands no longer shielded by federal law. It’s not clear if this property includes wetlands that would otherwise be at risk. 
While many tributaries of the Mississippi River have been altered to flow in a straighter “channel,” the Hatchie River is the longest free-flowing tributary of the Lower Mississippi and has the largest remaining floodplain in the state, according to TWRA Public Relations Director Emily Buck.
The pending purchase would add to more than 30,000 acres of protected state and federal public lands along the scenic Hatchie River, the only river in West Tennessee that was not channelized — engineered to be straighter, deeper or wider — in the mid-1900s. Instead, the Hatchie follows its natural meandering course, providing multiple types of habitat for the more than 100 species of fish and 35 mussel species that call the river home. 
The Hatchie River’s forests also support more than 250 species of birds, white-tailed deer, river otters, beavers, and the Eastern box turtle, among others.
TWRA plans to purchase the land from Hatchie River Hardwoods LLC, with help from two nonprofits: The Conservation Fund and The Nature Conservancy. The Conservation Fund will get the property under contract, and TWRA will ultimately acquire and manage the land, according to government documents.
The plot will become a new Wildlife Management Area, a space that conserves wildlife habitat while providing public access opportunities. It will be one of the largest bottomland hardwood forests (think river swamps) with a single owner in Tennessee.
TWRA will pay $450,000 toward the undisclosed “fair market value” price, with the Tennessee Heritage Conservation Fund covering the bulk of the cost, Buck said in a statement to Tennessee Lookout. The Wetlands Acquisition Fund will also be used. The land last sold in 2021 for around $27.5 million, state records show.
The Tennessee commissioner of agriculture and TWRA executive director have already approved the tract for purchase, and the State Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee also granted its approval in late August.
Buck surmises that TWRA will close on the property in November.

(Getty Images)Over the past 30 years, I’ve worked in nearly every corner of Idaho’s education system — teaching in classrooms, leading Catholic and public schools, and serving as a superintendent through times of growth, hardship and everything in between. Schools anchor our communities, especially in places like Kimberly where our school district is the city’s largest employer.
Right now, I’m more worried than ever about what’s ahead.
Earlier this year, the Legislature passed a law, despite record-breaking calls urging the governor to veto it, that uses $50 million in taxpayer dollars to subsidize private school tuition with little to no accountability for how those funds are used.
There’s a projected state budget deficit of $79 million. Gov. Brad Little has ordered state agencies to cut 3% from budgets to address the shortfall. While public schools, which serve 94% of Idaho’s students, have their operations budgets frozen for the fiscal year, that $50 million “Parental Choice Tax Credit” money remains untouched. 
Idaho’s projected budget deficit does not include impact of ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’

Let’s look at the big picture. Schools are already operating at a fraction of what budgets were before the recession. We made sacrifices during hard times with the promise things would bounce back. That was 15 years ago. Last session, legislators defeated a bill that would provide $3 million for high-needs special education students. Schools lost dedicated funds from the Idaho Lottery.
 In their place we were given a new “facilities bill” that sounded like an increase in funding, but is just a pass through for property taxes. While that’s a relief for property owners, it doesn’t pay for repairs, maintain schools, support growing enrollment or cover rising costs.
When lawmakers say we need to trim the fat in education, I challenge you to show me where it is. Instead of solving the problem by tapping into Idaho’s maxed-out rainy day fund, they’re stripping away more.
Communities like mine will be forced to ask taxpayers to pick up the difference, or schools may be pushed into financial crisis. Families who were promised more choices will see new bonds and levies on their ballots. That’s not choice.
Here’s the truth: We already have school choice in Idaho. Families can choose public schools, charter schools, private schools, homeschooling or online learning. That’s something to celebrate. But private schools are private for a reason.
When I was a Catholic school principal, we existed for the Catholic identity. We accepted students regardless of faith, we had an accredited curriculum and a strong staff of certified teachers. With my Catholic school hat on, I would have been looking at this law saying “the government shouldn’t be telling me what to teach.”
I also worry this new law will water down Idaho’s quality private schools while stripping funds from our public and charter schools. Why? If families have $5,000 a year per child for private tuition, we’ll likely see what happened in Arizona. Pop-up “private schools” emerged without accreditation, teachers without diplomas, background checks and no curriculum. That hurts everyone.
That’s not what taxpayer dollars were meant to fund.
Idaho’s public schools are already running lean. In districts like mine, we’ve cut, consolidated and squeezed every dollar. If these cuts go through, we’ll be talking about eliminating programs, reducing salaries and real threats to keeping our schools open — especially in rural areas.
This isn’t just an education issue. It’s an economic one. Our schools are often the largest employers in town. When they suffer, the whole community suffers.
We can’t allow a small group of political operatives to dismantle a system that, as required by our state constitution, serves everyone. We must preserve public education.
I urge every Idahoan to learn what’s really happening and to stand up for your local schools. Whether or not you have kids in the classroom, your tax dollars are on the line.
It’s time to say enough. Not one more public dollar for private tuition.

But messaging for health care providers this year is tricky.
“It is tumultuous. There’s a lot of chaos,” Dr. David Wohl told NC Newsline in a recent interview.
Wohl is a professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He has spent over 20 years leading research into the prevention and treatment of HIV. In 2020, he helped lead the UNC clinical and research response to COVID-19.
The tumult that Wohl is referring to now is the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his stance on vaccines.
In a fiery hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Kennedy justified his firing of an influential vaccine advisory panel, while saying it was unclear the COVID-19 vaccine had saved millions of lives. The 71-year-old Kennedy has expressed distrust in the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
‘Throwing shade’
Wohl calls the recent politicization of vaccines “tragic.”
Infectious diseases professor Dr. David Wohl (Screengrab from Newsline interview)
Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including North Carolina’s Mandy Cohen, wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed that Kennedy in his short tenure had “severely weakened programs designed to protect Americans” by canceling promising medical research and downplaying vaccines.
“Most people in this country understand that vaccines work,” Wohl said. “Especially older people who remember what it was like, you know, when there were such things as polio, you know, and whooping cough, you know, running through schools. So again, I think that most people get it, but our leadership is really, unfortunately, on the fringe. And this is a very, very dangerous course that we’re leading to.”
Wohl and others point to measles, once believed to be eliminated in the United States. Vaccine confusion and vaccine hesitancy has allowed the virus to reemerge.
“This is a vaccine that has been around for literally generations. We know all about it. We know about its safety. We know about its effectiveness. You know, two shots render you like 98% impervious to getting measles. It’s a triumph,” explained Wohl. “The epicenter of these outbreaks are in communities that have decided not to vaccinate their children. And we are seeing somebody come in from another place where measles is endemic and infecting people and then it spreads like wildfire.”
More than 1,400 confirmed cases have been reported in 41 states this year.
He notes that the good news is most of Americans are immune. If you were born before 1957, chances are you contracted measles and developed lifelong immunity. When the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, it became widely recommended for children and adults and by the ’70s was combined to what we now commonly call the MMR vaccine, covering measles, mumps and rubella.
“So, a lot of us are already immune but if it gets a niche into a place, a community where there’s less vaccination, then you start to see it spread. So, I think it’s a matter of time before we get some cases in North Carolina,” said the UNC Health infectious disease researcher.
But Wohl worries about Kennedy “throwing shade on vaccines” leading to only more confusion.
Senators and some states push back
In the Sept. 4 committee hearing, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis said Kennedy’s statements were so contradictory, he wanted them submitted in writing to clarify his positions.

“You [said you] will do nothing that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. There seem to be several reports that would seem to refute that,” Tillis said.
The North Carolina senator said he also wanted a written explanation for Kennedy’s firing of a CDC director, attempts to stall NIH funding, the canceling of mRNA research contracts and the firing of advisory board members.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), that now includes some vaccine skeptics selected by Kennedy over the summer, will meet Sept. 18 and 19.
“They’re not just going to talk about COVID vaccines. They’re going to talk about childhood vaccines as well,” Wohl said. “We may see things like Hepatitis B, which could be eliminated from this planet if there was more vaccination be pulled from the schedule. Like all these things that really are just a rollback, I do think could be very consequential and dangerous.”
Some North Carolina pharmacies are waiting for more guidance before widely administering the COVID vaccine this year. Others are requiring a prescription. According to Stateline, at least five states — Colorado, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York and Pennsylvania — have opted to break from the FDA’s policy and make the COVID vaccines accessible to those who wish to have a booster this fall.
Wohl acknowledges the changing federal policy around COVID can be confusing.  He recommends North Carolinians talk to a trusted medical care provider, and make sure they stay up-to-date on the vaccines that are accessible.
This year’s flu shot targets three different strains of seasonal flu and reduces not only the severity of illness but cuts one’s risk of having to see their doctor for flu by about 50%. North Carolina recorded more than 500 flu-related deaths during last year’s respiratory virus season.
The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) offers a detailed respiratory virus surveillance dashboard tracking how much virus is circulating each week.
Beyond annual immunizations 
Beyond the Department of Health and Human Services’ vaccine policies, Wohl is waiting to see how the Trump administration’s budget cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) impact university research.
“If you really want to talk about what makes America great, we have been the best at this,” he said. “Nobody comes close to the innovation, the creativity that the NIH helps fund.”
Wohl said the billions of dollars the first Trump administration provided to rapidly develop and distribute the COVID shots was a triumph, and is now wrongly being called into question by vaccine skeptics.
“The investment leads to all sorts of consequential products. People are hired. People work, based upon the NIH funding. We hire loads of people to do this kind of research. These are all good things that have collateral benefits for communities,” he explained.
UNC was selected in the summer of 2023 to participate in NIH research on Long COVID. This June the university was forced to close the clinic after the loss of multiple funding sources.
One in 6 North Carolinians has experienced Long COVID, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.
“You know, it’s not a good return on investment to pull this money. It’s the opposite. I don’t hear a really good justification for why we should take a chainsaw to these institutions,” Wohl said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250908_145615-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-09-09 06:56:55.153683

(Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)The final ethics complaint lodged against Shelby County’s district attorney by a state senator has been tossed.
District Attorney General Steve Mulroy released information showing the fifth and last ethics complaint filed against him by state Sen. Brent Taylor was dismissed by the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, the state body that handles ethics charges against attorneys.
Mulroy, a Democrat, said the Shelby County Republican lawmaker filed “groundless accusations” against him about the way he resolved two different cases, both alleging improper “ex parte” communications — without opposing attorneys present — with two different judges. 
Another dealt with what Mulroy called a “meritless” charge involving Juvenile Court records in adult court dealing with setting bail. 
Mulroy said the final case involved efforts he made with Juvenile Court Judge Tarik Sugarmon to consider the use of juvenile records, which Taylor favored in legislation approved this spring.

“Even though the outcome was positive, the intermediate experience was not,” Mulroy said in his newsletter. “I had to spend a fair amount of time and effort reviewing records and correspondence, documenting to the board what I did and why. It gave me a renewed appreciation for how stressful, expensive, time-consuming and life-disruptive criminal accusations can be, even if they are ultimately dismissed.”
Taylor was prepared last year to seek an ouster vote against Mulroy for “dereliction of duty” but couldn’t muster enough support in the Republican-controlled Senate to have him removed. Taylor then said he was going to request an investigation to determine whether the DA should be removed, but that never came to fruition.
Mulroy, who defeated Republican DA Amy Weirich in the last election, caught Taylor’s ire, in part, for introducing a plan to give non-violent felons “diversion” if they were caught carrying firearms. It was to be done case-by-case for those without a violent past or criminal history, but because of the uproar Mulroy declined to put the policy into place. 
Taylor did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

Jeff Landry’s administration has failed to regulate or provide oversight of public money given to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers over the past year, as required by state law. 

The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services did not monitor how state dollars were spent at pregnancy centers, create regulations for how they can use that money or track whether the centers met the goals of their state contracts, according to a report the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office released Monday. 

Those benchmarks were expected to be met under a 2024 state law to establish the Pregnancy and Baby Care Initiative, which replaced a similar state program called Alternatives to Abortion. 
“DCFS could have paid pregnancy centers for services ineligible for funding under state law,” read the report Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack submitted to lawmakers last Wednesday. 
For years, Louisiana has financially supported the controversial crisis pregnancy centers that were originally designed as competitors to abortion clinics. Their supporters say the centers, frequently affiliated with religious groups, offer assistance to pregnant people and new parents that is needed more than ever since Louisiana’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022. 
Critics said many of the centers misrepresent themselves as health care clinics, even when their staff members have little medical education. Some have also pushed unfounded medical concepts and treatments onto clients. 

For example, five of the pregnancy centers receiving state funding in the last year offer “abortion pill reversal” services, according to the auditor’s report. Such treatments have not been proven effective or safe and are denounced by leading physician organizations. 
In all, the state distributed $1.2 million to 12 crisis pregnancy centers from August 2024 to July 2025. Eleven of the 12 centers drew down the maximum funding the state offered of $100,800 during that period. 
The Landry administration intends to give the pregnancy centers more money this year. It has raised the annual cap for funding per center $249,999 in the current budget cycle, in spite of the auditor’s concerns about transparency. 
As of June, there were 38 pregnancy centers operating in Louisiana based on numbers in the audit report.

Lack of oversight
Louisiana lawmakers were specific about what services the state was willing to pay pregnancy centers to provide. 

The 2024 law that set up the Pregnancy and Baby Care Initiative states that only counseling, mentoring, classes and material items such as cribs or diapers can be covered with state money. It can also pay for referrals to other state agencies that can provide help with signing up for public benefits, child care or health programs. 

The auditor was unable to discern whether the state’s $1.2 million went toward covering these services because state officials did not require the pregnancy centers to provide documentation about where the money was spent. State contracts with the pregnancy centers also didn’t limit how the money could be used to what is laid out in the state statute.
Additionally, the Department of Children and Family Services told the auditor it never paid less than the maximum amount allowed of $300 per client per month to a pregnancy center over the first year of the program. 

“DCFS did not require pregnancy centers to bill only for services eligible for state funding or provide any additional supporting documentation for services provided,” according to the audit report. 
Got Medicaid? You’ll soon have access to doula services under a new Louisiana law

The centers provide a number of services to clients that are not supposed to be covered by the state including ultrasounds, at-home pregnancy tests, screenings for sexually transmitted infection and medication prescriptions. 
The agency also didn’t enforce state contract provisions that required the centers to meet certain service goals. It initially declined to impose more than $7,500 in fines on centers for missing those benchmarks, according to the auditor’s report. 
In response to the audit, the DCFS Secretary Rebecca Harris said she will implement more stringent reporting requirements for the centers and work to create state regulations by the end of the year. She will also make the centers pay the $7,500 in penalties they would have otherwise owed. 
“DCFS will not authorize payment for any services outside the scope of those permitted under state law,” Harris wrote in a letter to the auditor last month after receiving the report. 
Michelle Erenberg, executive director of abortion rights group Lift Louisiana, said she wasn’t surprised the state hasn’t monitored its spending with the pregnancy centers closely. She opposed the law, in part, because the reporting requirements weren’t stringent. 

“Several of these recommendations regarding oversight and transparency and more rigorous reporting are things that we have been suggesting that the legislature do for years,” Erenberg said in an interview Monday. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Umbrella nonprofit hasn’t been picked
Supporters of the pregnancy centers believe oversight of the program will improve once the Landry administration picks a nonprofit organization to run it. 

The 2024 law requires the Department of Children and Family Services to contract with a single nonprofit organization to distribute the state funding to pregnancy centers through subcontracts. The nonprofit is also supposed to set up a website and help promote the centers, according to state law. 
“We believe this program is done most effectively when a general contractor is named,” Ben Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group, said in an interview Monday. “We just urge the department to name a contractor for the best success.” 
The agency has not released the contract bid requirements for the nonprofit and, according to the report, will not have an organization hired for the job until July 2026, two years after the law was approved. The Department of Children and Family Services is struggling with the contract guidelines, according to the auditor, because of restrictions placed in the law. 

The statute does not allow the department to demand anything of the nonprofit except for the creation of a website and a commitment to do some marketing. Other “requirements” are explicitly forbidden, according to the law. 

In its report, the auditor questioned whether the nonprofit entity is even necessary or the best use of state funding. For years, the Department of Children and Family Services has contracted directly with pregnancy centers, and the auditor suggested it might be a waste of money to hire a middleman. 

“This could potentially decrease the funding available to pregnancy centers for services rendered because the general contractor will collect an administrative fee to pass funding from DCFS to the pregnancy centers,” according to the report. 
Other states with similar funding programs for pregnancy centers have also had problems when they have used nonprofit contractors to distribute the money. 
Texas overhauled its pregnancy center funding program – which distributes more than $100 million – this year after some anti-abortion centers appeared to be spending the money on activities other than direct services for pregnant people. Critics also alleged the state was overpaying for activities such as distributing pamphlets to clients. 
In Oklahoma, an auditor also found only $106,000 of $392,000 spent with its umbrella nonprofit went to pregnancy centers. The nonprofit said it was going to provide services to 9,300 women in Oklahoma over a year but only served 524, according to the Louisiana audit report. 

The man who set up those umbrella nonprofit organizations in Texas and Oklahoma, John McNamara, has been interested in working in Louisiana as well. 

In 2024, McNamara testified before a Louisiana Senate committee in favor of the law that established the new structure for funding pregnancy centers. 
He also reserved the name Louisiana Pregnancy Care Network with the Louisiana Secretary of State for a few months last year, though he didn’t end up purchasing it. The title is similar to the nonprofits he set up elsewhere, such as the Texas Pregnancy Care Network and the Oklahoma Pregnancy Care Network.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”
The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.
Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

(Louisiana Illuminator photo)Something remarkable is happening with the little brown lizards that have taken over the urban landscape of New Orleans. They’re living – and even thriving – with levels of lead in their blood that scientists say should be lethal to creatures that are far bigger, both two- and four-legged. 
A new Tulane University study on brown anoles could offer a better understanding of lead poisoning, how doctors can treat it and how wildlife evolves to live within an increasingly urban world, according to the researchers behind the findings. 
Doctors say there is no safe level of lead in blood for humans. When children are tested, the safe threshold is less than 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Lead levels above 45 micrograms require urgent medical attention and treatment. 
The average per-deciliter lead level in the lizards Tulane tested was 955 micrograms, according to the new research. 
“I was shocked,” said Annelise Blanchette, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency biologist who spearheaded the study for her doctoral thesis in evolutionary biology at Tulane University.

Older cities such as New Orleans deal with a long legacy of lead pollution from abandoned storage sites for leaded gasoline and lead-based pipes and paint that permeates its way into the soil. Lead doesn’t decompose over time, meaning its contamination risk remains indefinitely.
Children who are exposed to even low levels of lead face a risk of developmental delays, behavioral issues and damage to the brain, heart and kidneys.
Blanchette originally set out to discover how pollutants such as lead affect wildlife and focused on brown anoles out of convenience. Scientists say the anoles breathe in lead from the air and ingest it through the contaminated insects and water they consume.
“With the lizards being everywhere, so commonplace and being really great models in the lab, easy to keep in the lab, they were just kind of the natural next step,” she said. 
Brown anoles have spread across the eastern United States over the past 150 years, migrating aboard ships from Cuba and the Bahamas. They were first recorded in the Florida Keys in the 1880s and expanded rapidly throughout America in the 1940s. They’re believed to have established a foothold in New Orleans during the 1990s and have become the dominant low-level lizard since then, according to the Tulane study.   
It’s not easy being a green anole

The species thrives in suburban settings, where they have forced their cousins, the green anole, higher up into the treetops while the brown variety lives and hunts on the ground. Brown anoles have been mapped in 13 Louisiana parishes, concentrated in the southeastern part of the state. 
Blanchette said she had no idea she would find the anoles to be so hearty with such high amounts of lead in their bodies. Lizards collected in the field had the highest average and individual blood-lead concentration levels ever recorded in a wild mammal, bird, fish, amphibian or reptile, she said, making them the most lead-tolerant vertebrate currently known to science. 
“Everything else would be dead,” said Tulane assistant professor Alex Gunderson, who’s Blanchette’s adviser and co-author of the study. 
Beyond just surviving with such extreme levels of lead in their blood, the anoles showed no sign of typical lead poisoning— measured in loss of balance, speed and endurance when moving — until exposed to a level of lead in their blood nearly 10 times higher than scientists recorded in the wild. 
“I was absolutely shocked, but it was also very exciting because I knew then that the questions that we were interested in asking would be really interesting to answer,” said Blanchette. “These lizards could really potentially give us a lot of insight into lead tolerance and exposure.”
Beyond even a better understanding of the toxin itself, lead-resistant lizards could also offer hints as to how and why some creatures are better at adapting to a more polluted, human-heavy environment. 
“Clearly, they’re capable of handling toxic conditions that tend to be prevalent in human environments,” said Yoel Stuart, an evolutionary biologist and associate professor at Loyola University in Chicago. He has studied another type of anole to understand how the lizards evolve and just how quickly they are changing. 
To verify that the lizards are indeed adapting to higher levels of lead, Stuart said replicating the Tulane study in other locales could help answer unknown questions and inform efforts to prevent extinction for more vulnerable species as the world faces a critical loss of biodiversity. 
“I would love to know: If you feed a bunch of lead to a brown anole from a place where there’s as little lead as you can find, how do they do?” Stuart said. “If [New Orleans anoles] die at way lower levels than these lizards, that suggests that the New Orleans lizards have adapted. If the brown anoles [in another location] happen to be more resistant, then it could be that they’ve always had the right tools to deal with lead.”
Blanchette said researchers have some theories as to how brown anoles can handle such extreme levels of lead, such as producing more red blood cells to counteract the effect lead has on carrying oxygen throughout the body. But it’s also possible brown anoles deal with lead in a way that has nothing to do with oxygen, she said.
Either way, the findings could be big. 
“Is it something that we can expect lots of species to be able to do, or a subset of species to be able to do? That can inform conservation strategies,” Stuart said. “It might help us target places where we need to mitigate lead in the environment.”
Gunderson said finding an animal so tolerant to such a potent toxin indicates their bodies are doing something humans don’t fully understand — and need to study. He spoke to the importance of broad exploration in research, adding that unexpected findings such as this uncover secrets that might have otherwise remained hidden.
“I don’t think anyone would have expected lizards to be this lead-tolerant,” he said. “It’s important to study everything … you don’t know what you don’t know, right?”
