(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)Fred Cuozzo barely made it out of the South Obenchain Fire that burned through his home, barn, pumphouse and garage in Eagle Point, north of Medford, on Sept. 8, 2020.
Three years later, PacifiCorp — owner of Oregon private utility Pacific Power — was found by a jury to have been reckless and negligent in causing that fire and three others. In January 2024, a jury ordered the utility company to pay millions in damages to Cuozzo and nine other survivors, among the first group in an ongoing class action lawsuit.
Cuozzo still has not seen that settlement money because PacifiCorp is appealing the jury’s verdict. In three months, Cuozzo turns 80. He fears he might not in his lifetime see that money — money he needs to rebuild.
“I’ve been waiting almost five years since my home, contents and four other structures burned up,” he said. “I think they’re just waiting, trying to wait people out, and they can get tired of waiting or die, right?”
The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would do something about that, and it’s moving through the session with bipartisan support and little fanfare.
Senate Bill 926, sponsored by state Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, and co-sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeff Golden of Ashland and James Manning of Eugene, would impose some consequences on PacifiCorp, and the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, for delaying settlements and prolonging litigation if they are found to have recklessly or negligently caused a wildfire.
On April 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s four Democrats voted to pass it out of the committee and onto the Senate floor, recommending they also vote yes. The committee’s two Republicans opposed the bill. The larger Senate vote has not yet been scheduled.
Golden said he only recently learned about the bill and signed on as a sponsor.
“I am interested in faster settlements. I’m not interested in rate increases or favorable treatment (for utilities) until people who have been waiting for a remedy get it,” he said.
Unlike other bills this session related to private utilities and wildfire risk that have been more controversial — including bills to shield utilities from some financial liabilities, and one bill that would have prohibited utilities from raising rates if they had ongoing wildfire suits — Senate Bill 926 appears to be meeting little friction. Only one person spoke at its first public hearing in March: a father of three in Albany who supports the bill and expressed frustration over his rising electricity costs. Brock Smith, the bill’s chief sponsor, did not give testimony during the bill’s first hearing or in the run-up to the judiciary committee’s vote. He also didn’t respond to calls, emails or texts about the bill.
Utility companies oppose the bill. Portland General Electric lobbyist Greg Alderson called it “problematically broad” in a letter submitted to the committee two days after the hearing.
PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez, said in an email to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that the company strongly opposes the bill, though it has not yet submitted any formal testimony against it.
The bill was amended after public comment closed, unfairly and fundamentally altering the original bill without the opportunity to weigh in on the changes, both utilities contend.
Imposing consequences
Senate Bill 926 would prohibit Oregon’s private investor-owned utilities from recovering wildfire lawsuit costs from ratepayers — including fines, fees and settlements — if the company was found by a court or jury to have acted recklessly or negligently in causing the fire. It would also prohibit companies from raising rates to pay for repairing or replacing wildfire-damaged infrastructure if the company is found by court or jury to have been at fault for the fire.
Electric utilities indebted by a wildfire judgment would not be allowed to send dividends, income, interest or profits to corporate owners and shareholders and would pay 9% interest on any damages awarded to wildfire victims starting from the date of the fire, rather than the date the damages are awarded.
The bill would apply retroactively to all powerline-ignited wildfires since Jan. 1, 2020. For a company like PacifiCorp, that could mean millions in interest on cases that have been awaiting trial for years, and limits to the utilities’ now annual requests to raise rates.
“It is astounding that Senate leadership in the Oregon legislature is seeking to insert themselves into ongoing litigation involving PacifiCorp by retroactively imposing costs in the millions under a scheme that would apply to no other business in the state,” Gutierrez said.
He added that in light of a recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry that concluded PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, the bill should be reconsidered.
That state report refutes statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and months of trial testimony about the origins of the fires, and is unlikely to be admissible in PacifiCorp’s appeal because the company in 2023 moved to exclude all government reports at trial.

He was found deceased in the Sigler House, the president’s residence, in the late morning of April 17 during a wellness check after failing to appear for morning meetings, said Simpson College Board of Trustees Chair Terry Handley during a news conference.
It was “extremely unusual” for Byers to miss meetings, Handley said, and after staff was unable to reach him, a wellness check was conducted with the aid of the Indianola Police Department.
“This is stunning and devastating news to all of us here on campus,” Handley said.

Police Chief Brian Sher said he believes no criminal element was involved in Byers’ death, but provided no further comment due to the open investigation into the incident. Byers was alone in the house when they found him.

While Byers and his family did not live in the president’s residence full time, Handley said he used it as a “point of focus” for activities and events.
“My heart breaks for the Simpson community, the Indianola community, President Byers’s family and his many, many friends,” Sher said.
April 18 classes have been canceled and grief counselors will be made available for students and staff, Handley said. He and other university leaders will meet in the morning to begin discussing next steps for selecting an interim president and additional details will be shared next week.
A 1993 graduate of Simpson, Byers was announced as president of his alma mater in July 2023 after serving as president and CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership. In his tenure as president, Byers oversaw the implementation of new scholarship programs for incoming students and formed partnerships with other institutions with the goal of elevating the university.
Handley said Byers’ love and passion for the Simpson campus and community was “infectious,” and helped him rise above other candidates during the presidential search. Byers was known and loved beyond Simpson as well, he added, and was recognized locally and at the state and federal levels for his work.
“Jay has had a tremendous amount of influence and impact during his career, and this will take some time, but we will take that time to grieve, we will take our time to recover, and then we will move forward,” Handley said. “That’s exactly what Jay would expect.”

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)Mack Trucks will lay off between 250 and 350 workers at its Lehigh Valley Operations center outside Allentown over the next three months, due to economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday.
“Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,” spokesperson Kimberly Pupillo said.
“Today we informed our employees that this unfortunately means we’ll have to lay off 250-350 people at LVO over the next 90 days,” Pupillo said. “We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles.”
Union leaders announced the company had confirmed layoffs Thursday afternoon. The plant in Macungie employs around 1,200 workers.
“Due to the market being in decline, there will be a rate and line reduction. I have heard all the same rumors you guys have heard. This is the first time I have an official word from the company that there will be a layoff,” United Auto Workers Local 677 shop chair Tim Hertzog said in a letter posted on the union’s Facebook page Thursday.
State Rep. Josh Siegel (D-Lehigh) said the layoffs are “a clear signal of the dangerous economic instability being fueled by the Trump administration’s chaotic tariff policies.”
“The tariffs — erratic, broad and poorly targeted — are crushing core U.S. industries like trucking and manufacturing. Supply chains are snarled, costs are soaring, and confidence among employers is collapsing,” Siegel said in a news release.
President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail last year that tariffs would return manufacturing to the United States and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.
At the beginning of April, Trump announced tariffs on products imported from other countries beginning a universal 10% duty and increasing with additional reciprocal tariffs as high as 50% against countries with large trade deficits or other barriers to exports.
The announcement sparked a massive stock market sell-off that erased trillions of dollars in value that was followed by the largest single-day increase when Trump announced a 90-day reprieve for most countries. He doubled down on tariffs for Chinese imports, raising the duties to 125%.
Siegel called on U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), whose district includes the Lehigh County Mack plant, and Senators John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) to “take back Congress’s constitutional authority on trade and end this economic sabotage before more livelihoods are lost.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA) A bill advanced from the Iowa House Thursday that would regulate anaerobic digesters, or systems that break down organic material in an oxygen-deprived system to produce usable biogas and fertilizer, at animal feeding operations. 
House File 989 would task the Iowa Department of Natural Resources with regulating the construction, expansion, placement and operation of anaerobic digesters and associated structures that hold manure feedstocks at animal feeding operations. 
The bill describes anaerobic digestion in three steps. First the feedstock, both liquid and dry animal waste, is stored. Next, the feedstock is “digested” in a structure specifically designed for anaerobic digestion. As the material is broken in the digester, the bio gas is extracted. The final step takes the leftover material, called the digestate, and either stores it or applies it as organic material to farmland. 
Rep. Mike Sexton, R-Rockwell City, said the bill draws a “distinct line” between animal feeding operations and anaerobic digesters so the two can be enforced properly. 
Sexton said under current regulations, any compliance issues that happen with an anaerobic digester are put on the livestock operation because the digesters don’t have their own licenses with the state. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under the bill, operators would have to apply for a construction permit from DNR before building an anaerobic digester, or any of the related storage structures. This permit would require information on things like construction, size, operators and how the digestate would be applied. 
The bill states anaerobic digesters must comply with separation distances for clean air regulations and follow the same water quality separation distances put on animal feeding operations. The bill lists civil penalties for operations that do not comply with these regulations. 
According to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Iowa has fewer than 10 anaerobic digesters on livestock operations — most are at dairies. 
Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, spoke in support of the bill, but said she hopes for more conversation moving forward on the impacts to the environment and health. 
“There (are) remaining environmental concerns, there’s health concerns around this technology, and I believe that there should be a lot more robust conversation going forward,” James said.
An article from the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club called the Iowa bill a “bandaid on a bigger problem” with the agricultural industry. The environmental group, which registered against HF 989, said the bill does not provide adequate separation distances from houses and other structures and will encourage animal feeding operations to expand. 
Sexton said he does not believe the regulations will inspire more concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, to be built in Iowa because “there’s just not that much money in farming right now.”
“These anaerobic digesters are going to get built on existing animal feeding operations,” Sexton said. 
Anaerobic digestion can generate renewable energy from other feedstocks, including things like food waste. Sexton has also worked on an additional bill, House File 987, that would create regulations for “community anaerobic digester systems” that use organic material other than animal manure. 
Sexton said his amendment to HF 989, which passed, brought the language in line with the other digester bill. 
PFAS amendment 
Rep. Monica Kurth, D-Davenport, filed an amendment to the bill that would require testing the materials in the digester structure for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl, commonly known as PFAS, substances. 
“They are everywhere, and they are aptly named forever chemicals because they don’t break down, they don’t go away,” Kurth said. 
Kurth said the amendment would prevent digestate with high levels of PFAS from being applied to the land. 
The amendment is similar to House File 723, which required water treatment plants to test sewage sludge for PFAS, and notify landowners of the results before the sludge was applied as fertilizer. HF 723 did not advance ahead of the legislative funnel deadlines. 
Sexton urged the body to reject the amendment and said DNR would have opportunities to write additional rules on such matters.
“I appreciate the amendment, but Iowa’s farmers are very concerned about what they put on their farm ground,” Sexton said. “They’re the ones that have to live there. They’re the ones that have their livestock on that ground.” 
Kurth’s amendment failed, 59-32. 
Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, said he had several concerns with what he perceived as loopholes in the bill, but said he appreciated the efforts on HF 989, especially in comparison to the anaerobic digestion policy in the governor’s energy bill, that he said was “very concerning.” 
The bill will advance to the Senate, and Sexton said he hopes to see the community digester bill advancing soon.

(Stock photo by Oliver Helbig/Getty Images)A proposal that would lift the anonymity of people filing complaints against a law enforcement officers advanced in a Florida House committee on Thursday, even though key players in Florida law enforcement are divided about whether the legislation is truly “Backing the Blue.”
The proposal sponsored by Miami-Dade Republican Tom Fabricio (HB 317) would require a person who initially files an anonymous complaint about a law or corrections officer in the state to have to give up his or her anonymity before any interrogation of that officer can commence.
Both the Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association oppose the bill.
“It will not increase accountability,” said Tampa International Airport Police Department Chief Charlie Vasquez, who is serving as president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association. “It will make it more difficult to hold officers accountable when they have serious misconduct.”
But other parts of the law enforcement community do support the measure, such as the Florida Fraternal Order of Police.
A member of that organization, Miami Police officer Felix Del Rosario, said the proposal is about fairness, integrity, “and the protection of those who dedicate their lives to public service.”
Del Rosario added that, for too long, police officers in Florida have been subjected to “prolonged and ambiguous investigations.”
“This legislation helps address those inequities,” he said, “by ensuring that officers have timely access to their complete investigative file, providing safeguards against unfounded and malicious allegations that can have long lasting affects on an officers’ reputation, career, and upholding the principals of.due process and equal treatment under the law.”
‘I also back the Black’
Orange County Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis noted how the Legislature last year effectively eliminated civilian review boards designed to oversee certain local law enforcement, which was supported by the sheriffs and police chiefs, so why wouldn’t they support those agencies on this piece of legislation?
“I feel like I’m in an alternate universe right now because I hear from this chamber, from this committee, often times that we need to ‘Back the Blue.’ And the Blue just spoke. What I wrote down from the police chief is that this bill will make it more difficult to hold officers accountable when they participate in misconduct,” she said.
And Bracy Davis, who is Black, said she was speaking as a representative of a minority-majority district with constituents who in some cases “have apprehension when it comes to dealing with police officers.”
“So, not only do I ‘Back the Blue’, but I also back the Black, and I back the Brown.”
Rep. Bruce Antone, who also is Black, said he opposed the bill which, ultimately would repeal anonymity for a complainant once law enforcement begins interrogating the accused officer. Antone listed three separate occasions when he was harassed by law enforcement.
South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said he disagreed with the notion that if he opposed the bill he somehow was not ‘Backing the Blue.’
“We have many masters, and in a bill like this we have the administration, we have the rank and file, the law enforcement officers who are on the street fighting day and day out to protect the society, and we have the citizens, and each one of us represents approximately 175,000 individuals,” he said. “And to come here and tell us that if we vote no on this product we don’t ‘Back the Blue?’ That’s just not true.”
‘You put your face on it’
But Republicans on the committee said that while the administrators and lobbyists for Florida’s top law enforcement agencies oppose the bill, actual cops on the street support it, and that should be good enough.
“All we’re saying is, if you have a complaint against someone,  just like if you’re going to accuse someone in a court of law, put your face on it,” said Hillsborough County GOP Rep. Danny Alvarez, whose job outside of the Legislature is general counsel for the Tampa Police Benevolent Association. “And if you can’t put your face and name on it, then it’s not worthy of going forward and smearing this person for the rest of their career.” 
Alvarez added that the bill was “for the cop, not the sergeant, not the captain, and not the chief.”
Last week, when the bill was heard in the House Government Operations Subcommittee,  Jennifer “Cookie” Pritt, executive director of Florida Police Chiefs Association, gave highly personal testimony regarding an incident involving a herself and a high-ranking command officer as a real life example of why she opposed the bill. She chose not to comment publicly on the measure on Thursday.
Ultimately, the House Judiciary Committee voted 16-4 to advance the bill, and it now moves to the full House for consideration. But it may not end up becoming law this year, as its Senate companion (SB 516) has yet to be heard in any committee in that chamber.

The legislation allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enter into agreements to enforce the country’s immigration laws with federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Currently, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office is the only state entity with that power.
Under the bill, sheriffs’ deputies; police officers and state troopers may also arrest people based on their immigration status “when authorized by federal law.” Law enforcement must also obtain documents to verify a person’s immigration status, be that a passport or a permanent resident card.
The chamber adopted a committee substitute 77-20 that removed some of the requirements. Previously, the Attorney General’s Office was required to publicly name any agency failing to comply with provisions in the legislation and notify the governor’s office, but the amendment gives it the option.
Alabama has low rates of immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only 4% of Alabama’s population was foreign-born in 2023, compared to 14.3% nationwide. Only 6% of the population speaks a language other than English at home, compared to 22.5% of the U.S. population. 
House Democrats criticized the legislation, saying it trafficked in stereotypes about immigrants without status and that it could discourage cooperation with law enforcement in criminal investigations.  Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, said he was worried about his foreign-born constituents and how the legislation will impact their trust in law enforcement. 
“Bringing local law enforcement into the equation is going to create a lot of fear among people that are not doing anything wrong, that aren’t committing crimes,” Ensler said. “They’re already on edge, and a lot of people are just trying to work hard. They’re trying to better themselves, provide for their families, and I’m just concerned about how this will impact them.”
The bill states that people cannot be detained solely because of their immigration status unless authorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and that sheriffs’ deputies and police departments will verify that a person has an arrest warrant within 24 hours of the person getting detained.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, said it would lead to racial profiling and echoed Ensler saying it will increase local distrust in law enforcement.
“When local police are perceived as immigration agents, victims and witnesses of crimes within immigrant communities become reluctant to come forward,” Rafferty said. “That doesn’t make communities safer. It actually makes it far more dangerous.”
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said there are more American citizens that commit crimes than people without legal status. Studies have repeatedly proven that. 
“I think that it’s so unfair for us to just focus on one group of people and then with the immigrants that we are attacking,” she said.
Yarbrough said the bill was inspired by Laken Riley, a Georgia college student that was killed by a person without legal status in 2024. He said she would not have been killed if legislation like his existed when a colleague asked him. Rafferty said Riley’s death could have been prevented with better communication between law enforcement about the man accused of killing her. 
“The failure wasn’t in our laws, but in the implementation and coordination between agencies, if it doesn’t address the actual systemic failures and communication between local and federal authorities that actually contributed to this tragedy,” he said.
The House passed the bill 74-26. It now moves to the Senate.

Putting tariffs on lithium imported from China would seem to create more demand, and a higher price, for lithium mined in Nevada.
So why is Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo asking President Donald Trump to remove tariffs on lithium from China? 
Because Nevada also has hopes of becoming a national hub for manufacturing lithium batteries.
And, Lombardo noted in a letter to Trump Thursday, Nevada’s domestic lithium industry “is still in its early stages. At present, there is no domestic technology capable of refining lithium to the standards required for manufacturing while also meeting our country’s environmental regulations. As a result all manufacturing grade lithium is imported from China.”
“As you can imagine,” Lombardo continued in his letter, “this is damaging all United States manufacturing that is dependent on this product.”
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has repeatedly condemned and attempted to nullify by clawing back funding, a Department of Energy loan program provided $2 billion in financing for Redwood Materials’ battery component recycling and production facility in Nevada.
“Mr. President, I respectfully urge you to reconsider and remove the tariffs on lithium,” Lombardo wrote. “Given that domestic processing is not yet a viable option, the current environment poses a serious risk to jobs in Nevada and across the country.”
Lombardo joins the ranks of several Republican officeholders in the nation who have critiqued the benefits of Trump’s tariff policies, which have continued to hammer stock markets even after Trump pulled back from most of his “Liberation Day” tariffs on nations the world over.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lombardo-bendnarksi-close-crop.jpg,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

Contributed/Altamaha RiverkeeperClean energy advocates say that a new exemption granted by the Trump administration for dozens of power plants – including two in Georgia – is the latest example of federal policy favoring the coal industry despite pollution concerns.
Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption allowing Georgia Power’s Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
At the request of Georgia Power’s parent company, Southern Co., the two fossil fuel plants were among the more than 60 power plants granted an exemption. The federal agency said the move would bolster national energy security.
Biden’s EPA issued a rule last year tightening toxic metal emission standards by 67% and reducing mercury emissions standards by 70% from existing coal- and oil-firing power plants. The stricter regulations were set to be enforced in 2027.
“At EPA, we are committed to protecting human health and the environment; we are opposed to shutting down clean, affordable and reliable energy for American families,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.
Georgia Power has cited the cost of environmental compliance in the debate over the continued operation of coal-fired plants and the cleanup of toxic coal ash left behind. The company has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the lifeline of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.
In its 2022 resource plan, the utility said it would retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited a projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035, and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.
Isabella Ariza, a senior attorney for the Georgia chapter of the Sierra Club, said the Trump administration’s action will undermine a rule designed to limit dangerous toxins.
“It’s definitely making it hard for environmental interveners in the Georgia Power (Integrated Resource Plan) and subsequent rate case this year to make a case that Georgia Power should get rid of aging and expensive coal,” Ariza said.





State regulators began holding hearings on Georgia Power’s long-term resource plans in March. Those hearings are set to continue in late May. 





“We’re hoping that (water pollutant guidelines), coal combustion residuals and other policies remain in place,” she said. “That’s the only way we have to protect the people that live near these plants even if companies like Georgia Power decide to keep burning coal.”
Southern Co. said in a statement that it remains in compliance with the federal guidelines for Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which cover air emission limits for coal- and oil-fired power plants.
“Extending the current deadline will provide additional time needed both to address potential rule changes and further demonstrate compliance to the current requirements,” the company statement said.
Keri Powell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Georgia office and air program leader, said this exemption allows polluters to place communities in Bartow and Monroe counties at risk by spewing more toxic chemicals into the air.
“Residents in and around Bartow and Monroe counties should be concerned that this reckless attempt to exempt utilities from these rules will expose them to more toxic chemicals and health risks,” Powell said in a statement. “This attempt is a slap in the face to Georgians who face disproportionate harm from the dirty fossil fuel industry.”
Ariza said there is some optimism that the economics for renewable energy will continue to improve enough to support utility companies increasing their capacity as an alternative to coal.

Levering, who now lives in Nebraska, […]","Marcia Levering, left, on Thursday shared her story of being attacked by an inmate at a CoreCivic-run detention facility in Leavenworth, Kansas, and the resulting 16 surgeries that left her disabled. She was supported by her friend and another former detention employee Shari Rich. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — Around the corner from a defunct for-profit prison owned by Tennessee-based CoreCivic, Marcia Levering walked carefully across a grassy field to a podium at Ray Miller Park, aided by her cane and a friend, to speak out against the company’s desire to open an ICE detention facility.
Levering, who now lives in Nebraska, worked at the CoreCivic’s Leavenworth Detention Center for 10 months beginning in 2020 before she was stabbed four times by an inmate — once in the ear, once in the right arm, and twice in the abdomen. She shared her experience at a Thursday press conference hosted by ACLU Kansas, Cross-Border Network for Justice & Solidarity and Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, speaking out against CoreCivic’s desire to reopen the prison and house immigrants.
“As usual, we were understaffed,” Levering said of the attack. “There are two officers in Q building, when there should have been seven. I was in training for a new position. The day of my assault, on Feb. 6, 2021, I was coming out of my office. Unit Four accidentally buzzed open the wrong door, allowing an inmate to come out, throwing boiling water in my face and stab me four times.”
Levering said corrections officers expect to be in danger, but a pattern of understaffing and poor working conditions made the job much more dangerous than it should have been.
The CoreCivic facility closed  in 2021 when its contract with the United States Marshal’s Service ended. Reports by oversight agencies when the Leavenworth facility closed highlighted problems at the facility, including understaffing and the use of “triple bunking” in cells, a practice of adding a third bunk to a cell designed for two inmates.
Leavenworth citizens and others from across the state have stepped forward to protest CoreCivic’s plant to reopen, speaking out through public rallies and at city meetings. City officials heard and responded. The most recent step in disagreements between the city and CoreCivic officials was a lawsuit filed March 31. The city said the company had not followed a proper permitting process to reopen.

Staffing shortages critical
Shari Rich, who worked at the CoreCivic facility for 13 years, attended Thursday to put her voice to those urging the city of Leavenworth to keep the detention center closed. Her first years with the company were good, and she considered the facility well run.
But in the last six years, it steadily deteriorated, she said.
“I worked control,” she said, explaining that was the eyes and ears of the building, keeping oversight of what was happening. “And usually we had two to three officers up there at all times. At the end, when she (Levering) got hurt, there was only one person manning that whole place. There are 24 pods.”
Using her hands, Rich counted how many doors and gates that was for one person to watch, a total that came to more than 45.
“So one person was manning that whole place,” Rich said.
“This was inevitable,” Levering interjected about the attack that left her partially paralyzed and for which she underwent 16 surgeries. “A matter of when.”
 
In the public eye 
Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for ACLU of Kansas, said the Thursday press conference was a way to keep the issue in front of the Leavenworth community. Although organizations put the event together, she said it’s important that the city be the focus.
“I definitely want it to be more of a bridge for the folks that have these stories to tell, who know firsthand the impact that the facility had on them,” she said. “I think we need to keep remembering that there are people who are at the heart of this.”
Tseng said the city’s officials have stepped up for those who shared their disagreement with CoreCivic reopening.
“It sort of took on its own momentum, right?” she said. “I think it’s such an issue that, like, really spoke to people. I really want to make sure that CoreCivic doesn’t just get to dominate the conversation.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin disagreed, calling the facility’s opponents “politically extreme, out-of-touch, outsider groups that want to tell the people of Leavenworth what to do.”
“The fact is the Leavenworth community wants our facility, the 300 jobs it will create, and the $2 million in annual local revenue it will generate,” Gustin said. “It’s time for the city commission to reject outside groups from hijacking this issue for their own political gain at the expense of the Leavenworth economy. Elected leaders should tell these outside groups to stop sending the message that the public safety profession is not welcome in Leavenworth.
“CoreCivic will operate a safe, transparent, and accountable facility that will be positive for the community,” he said.

Becoming an advocate
William Rogers, another former employee of CoreCivic, has become a grassroots advocate, filling out Kansas Open Records Requests and tracking down building permits and emails as he fights to stop the company from reopening a facility.
When speaking about holding an inmate, Dillon Reed, as he died, Rogers’ voice broke and he struggled to go on.
“I still see Dillon Reed at night sometimes when I go to bed,” Rogers said. “He was a good kid. He should have never died in there. He died because of staff negligence. People are humans in there. They’re inmates, but they’re humans. I think every one of us need to understand that these people have families. They have people that love them. We had a job to do, and we failed that day.”
Rogers received pointed out that CoreCivic promised in emails, which he provided to Kansas Reflector, to use local contractors to do all the upgrades the facility. But when he got a copy of a building permit for the complete removal and replacement of the roof, the contractor was a Texas company, Bass Roofing and Restoration LLC.
CoreCivic also offered, in emails from CoreCivic’s John Malloy:

“A one-time impact fee payment of $1,000,000
An annual impact fee payment of $250,000
An annual impact fee to the police department of $150,000″

The company also said it expects to employ 300 to 350 full-time employees with a total salary and benefit package between $25 million and $30.2 million per year.
 
Prioritizing ‘progress over people’ 
Sister Jean Panisko, with the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, was the opening speaker Thursday.
“We’re Catholic women, religious, devoted to the work of justice, peace and upholding the integrity of creation,” she said. “We applaud the city commissioners for their actions, for listening to our community and protecting the city by suing CoreCivic, asking them to apply for a special-use permit with money provided by our government.”
Panisko said CoreCivic is promising conditions won’t be the same, but she said the facility “wasn’t closed by chance.”
“It was shut down by the previous presidential administration after serious reports and ultimately finding mismanagement, abuse conditions,” she said. “The closure was and continues to be an indictment of a failed system, one that prioritizes progress over people,  efficiency over empathy and contracts over projects.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levering-and-Rich-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903
,DC,2025-04-17 22:24:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Appeals court hears arguments on Trump restricting AP from White House spaces,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-hears-arguments-trump-restricting-ap-white-house-spaces,,"WASHINGTON — The Associated Press and the Trump administration faced tough questioning in court Thursday as the White House fights to block a lower court order mandating officials stop denying the wire outlet entry to spaces where other journalists are permitted.A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia grilled the parties at length on how the First Amendment applies to journalists in the Oval Office and other areas, and whether the president can decide which journalists follow him in the press pool and exclude others based on their viewpoint.The case, playing out at the district court level as well, tests decades of established press access for the AP in the White House, which was curtailed after President Donald Trump declared the term “Gulf of America” should be used rather than “Gulf of Mexico.”District Judge Trevor McFadden sided with the AP on April 8 on the grounds that the Trump administration violated the wire service’s First Amendment rights when it publicly retaliated against the agency for an editorial decision to continue using “Gulf of Mexico” in its reporting and influential stylebook.Oval Office not for ‘silent retreat’Before the appeals court Thursday, Eric D. McArthur, representing the government, argued against McFadden’s “unprecedented” preliminary injunction, saying it interferes with the president’s “autonomy” in “highly restricted spaces.”Pointing out the AP was not demanding access “when the president wants to concentrate on his writing and his work,” Judge Corenlia Pillard said “it’s a little confusing to me when you say a place of ‘autonomy.’”“You make the Oval sound like a place of silent retreat,” said Pillard, who was appointed to the appeals bench during President Barack Obama’s second term.Pillard also highlighted the expectation of privacy is different for people in “high public office.”“There’s already a dozen people in there, so he’s agreed to have a press pool,” she said during McArthur’s roughly 45-minute questioning.The administration argued in its emergency appeal to block the ruling that Trump will be “irreparably injured” if the higher court doesn’t stay the lower court order while it adjudicates the case.Officials also countered that the First Amendment protects the president’s right to choose which journalists enter the Oval Office, Air Force One or Mar-a-Lago based on the content of their coverage.Where’s the distinction?Charles Tobin, attorney for the AP, argued that the White House has “brazenly excluded” AP reporters and photographers from opportunities open to other journalists.McFadden “appropriately and very narrowly tailored” his injunction, Tobin said. The lower judge ruled that, under the First Amendment, once the White House opens doors for all journalists to spaces including the Oval Office and East Room, it cannot then exclude them based on viewpoint.McFadden explicitly wrote his ruling does not mandate journalists be given access to the president or that the president cannot choose which outlets to grant exclusive interviews.Judge Neomi Rao said, “the AP concedes he could choose journalists based on viewpoint for exclusive interviews.”“When you’re talking about 10 or 12 journalists in the Oval or on his plane or in his home at Mar-a-Lago, what is the distinction?” asked Rao, who was appointed during Trump’s first presidency.Tobin replied that the pool is a system that invites numerous journalists to participate on a rotating basis.“That’s exactly where the distinction lies,” he said.Private invitations allowableJudge Gregory Katsas presented other scenarios when the president could invite only “supportive” members of the public and press, for example in the Cabinet room for a policy rollout.Tobin argued if the event is open to all press members, the president cannot discriminate based on viewpoint.“Once you have a system of rotation, that’s when the viewpoint becomes anathema,” Tobin replied.What if the president “tapped (certain reporters) on the shoulder” and invited only them into the Oval Office, asked Katsas, who was appointed during Trump’s first term.Tobin replied the president could handpick reporters for a private interview in the Oval Office, as long as it wasn’t an event open to the wider press pool.“This seems awfully close to what’s happening here,” Katsas said.Wire position axedOn Wednesday the White House announced a new media policy placing restrictions on all wire services’ access to the Oval Office and other spaces. Other wire services include Bloomberg and AFP.Despite McFadden’s court order, the White House on Monday denied entry to an AP reporter and photographer to an Oval Office press conference between Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.The AP filed a motion in district court Wednesday requesting McFadden to enforce his preliminary injunction.McFadden has scheduled a hearing for Friday.The White House began denying the AP entry to the Oval Office, East Room and other places on Feb. 11.Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, announced in late February that White House officials would take over pool rotation decisions from the White House Correspondents Association, a member organization that has self-governed journalist rotations and briefing seats placement since the Eisenhower administration.",,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

(Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma teenager who was arrested in connection with an Election Day terror plot has pleaded guilty, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.
Abdullah Haji Zada, 18, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, has pleaded guilty to knowingly receiving, attempting to receive and conspiring to receive a firearm and ammunition to be used to commit terrorism, prosecutors with the Western District of Oklahoma said in a press release.
Prosecutors said Zada, who was 17 when he was arrested in October, pleaded guilty as an adult and faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and deportation to Afghanistan upon his release.
Prosecutors allege Zada and a co-conspirator, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, obtained AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition and conspired to provide support to ISIS to conduct a November 2024 Election Day attack.
Federal investigators have said Tawhedi, who is also an Afghan citizen, allegedly admitted that he planned to target large gatherings of people and said the two expected “to be martyred.” Tawhedi had also taken steps to liquidate his family’s assets and resettle his relatives overseas, officials said.
The criminal complaint alleged the two men advertised the sale of personal property on Facebook. A confidential source asked if a computer was still for sale, which ultimately led Tawhedi and Zada to meet with the buyer at a rural location to test firearms.
The two met with an FBI asset at a rural property and bought and received two AK-47 assault rifles, 10 magazines and 500 rounds of ammunition, according to the criminal complaint.
Authorities then arrested the two.
Authorities said Tawhedi has been charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and receiving a firearm to commit a felony or federal crime of terrorism. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the latter offense. 
Prosecutors said Tawhedi awaited trial on those charges Thursday.

(Photo by Erik Gunn /Wisconsin Examiner)The economic uncertainty that has sent the stock market and consumer confidence plummeting in the last month hasn’t yet affected employment in Wisconsin, according to the state’s chief economist.
Wisconsin’s job numbers reached another record high in March, and unemployment, although up slightly, is still close to an all-time low, the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) reported Thursday.
Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration has contributed to falling consumer confidence as well as business confidence, said Dennis Winters, DWD’s chief economist. So far that hasn’t affected the state’s job market, however, he said.
Based on a monthly federal survey of employers, DWD projected Wisconsin had 3.055 million nonfarm jobs in March — an increase of 10,000 from February and 15,000 from a year ago.
From a separate household survey, the department projected Wisconsin’s March unemployment rate at 3.2%. That’s even with February, but a slight increase from the 2.9% calculated for March of 2024.
The job growth was greatest in service industries, which added more than 21,000 jobs over the last 12 months.
Manufacturing jobs have fallen by 7,000 since March 2024 — all of that in durable goods. Winters said that reflects longstanding challenges in the sector more than specific recent developments.

Spencer Cox — a Republican who has called tariffs a “huge gamble” but also said that he hopes “President Trump is right” about them — said state officials are continuing to monitor their impacts on Utah businesses, and that the state’s smaller businesses are “going to be hit the hardest.” 
Cox also said he’s instructed state agencies to prepare for possible budget cuts if a recession hits the U.S. 
“We’re always planning for the worst. That’s part of what we do every year, and we’re one of the few states that does that,” Cox told reporters during his monthly PBS Utah news conference on Thursday. “But look, I look at the data just like everyone else, and the possibility of a recession has gone up significantly. Certainly the trade wars have played a role in that.” 
Regardless of “whether you think trade wars are good or bad or will lead to something better, everybody agrees that it’s going to cause pain in the short term.” 
“And we have to be ready for that,” he said.

During a separate news conference earlier this week, on Tuesday, when he and Republican legislative leaders celebrated Utah’s 18th year being ranked No. 1 in the nation for best economic outlook, Cox said he had “instructed all of my department heads to come up with recession plans, looking at three different levels of cuts … if there is a recession.” 
Cox said Thursday that state leaders “will be very cautious in our spending” heading into July 1, when the state’s fiscal year starts, and “we’ll adjust accordingly.” 
For 18th year, Utah ranks No. 1 for best economic outlook. What could threaten its top spot?

The Utah Legislature is already expected to convene in a special session in May to tackle issues the governor outlined in a veto letter he issued March 27, to make changes to at least two bills — HB263, a bill dealing with election transparency and HB356, a bill requiring some counties to elect district-based council members. During that special session, he also said he wants the Legislature to repurpose $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep the Sundance Film Festival, which opted instead to move to Colorado.
It’s possible, depending on national developments and impacts to the economy, that state leaders could also consider budget changes during a special session, but that remains to be seen. 
Pressed on how state leaders will ensure “equity” among state agencies if there are budget cuts so that some services, like social services, aren’t overly impacted, Cox said “the Legislature ultimately controls the purse,” but he also added “we would be equitable in those types of cuts.” 
Cox also said Utah leaders did something similar during the Great Recession. 
“We took some across-the-board cuts, but then we let the experts who run those departments figure out how to implement those,” he said. “Because in recessionary times, there are some places where you would want to increase the budget and others where you would want to decrease it more.” 
He presented a hypothetical scenario of a 3% cut. “It doesn’t mean you cut 3% from every program, but every department would have to find those 3% cuts in their own ways that make sense and continue to serve the people in the state,” he said. 



Tariffs’ impact to Utah businesses, Canada
Cox — who went on a trade mission to Canada last week — said he’s “concerned about the small businesses that are going to be impacted by this.” 
However, he also said he’s “hopeful” that leaders on both sides can “figure out” solutions. 
Excluding gold exported to the United Kington for refinement, Canada, Mexico and China are among Utah’s top trade partners. 
Utah exported $1.3 billion and imported $4.9 billion in goods from Mexico in 2023, according to a recent report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. Canada is the second biggest source of Utah’s imports, with $3.1 billion in imports and $1.7 billion in exports that year. China ranks No. 3, with Utah taking in $2.7 million in imports from the country and exporting $1.2 billion. 
Two industries Cox discussed Thursday as being impacted included manufacturing and housing. On the latter, he said he’s “always concerned about the price of housing and what that means for our state and our country.” 
He said World Trade Center Utah and the Governor’s Office of Economic Development are staying in touch with Utah manufacturing companies and “helping them find new suppliers and better, cheaper ways to make their product.” 
Utah GOP leaders defend Trump’s tariffs while bracing for economic ‘turbulence’

“We’ve had some incentives in the past and we’ll be increasing those to move manufacturing here, which is why we led the nation in manufacturing (job growth) last year,” he said. 
Most of all, Cox said he hopes national leaders will at some point soon provide more stability and certainty when it comes to tariffs. He said he’s “supportive of getting pieces of this right, and so I’m grateful that we have an administration that’s willing to look at this.”
“I’m hopeful for more certainty,” he said. “Businesses can be resilient. Capital is a coward, for sure, but once you know the rules, business and entrepreneurs will figure out a way to work around whatever those parameters are. It’s harder when you don’t know what the rules are going forward … so more than anything, we just need to get this nailed down as soon as possible.”
On his conversations with Canadian leaders during his trade mission last week, Cox said, “our Canadian counterparts absolutely agreed that we should be pushing back on China and some of their unfair practices and some of their own tariffs and other issues.” 
But “that being said,” Cox said, “there are still a lot of companies that manufacture out of China, especially smaller companies in Utah who are going to be hit the hardest.” 
“There are lots of companies that are just going to be hurt, there’s not much we can do about it other than trying to help them,” he said. 
Pressed on Canada leaders’ message to him about tariffs, Cox said “their message is exactly what you would expect and what you’ve heard from the premiers there and from the Prime Minister.”
“You know, they felt really disheartened, I guess would be one way to say it,” he said. “Some used the word, kind of, betrayed, that they’re our closest ally and friend. … And yet, there was also a recognition by many of them that they needed to make some changes in Canada as well, which I think is helpful.”
Cox added that Canada “has had very high tariffs on several of their products,” including dairy and lumber, and also has “trade barriers” between its own provinces. He said they also recognized “they needed to invest more in their security and defense as well.”
“So it was interesting to hear this, this recognition that they did need to make some changes, and were willing to do that,” he said. “But yeah, obviously they were very hurt. We’re their overwhelmingly large trading partner, and they’re going to try to diversify more of their trade with other places, but we want to continue that partnership.”

Senate Bill 2137 prevents the North Dakota Game and Fish Department from banning deer hunting over bait. The agency has imposed baiting bans in some areas of the state as it tries to prevent the spread of chronic wasting disease, which can be fatal in deer. 
“We can deal with wildlife management and respect private property rights,” Armstrong, who is a hunter, said in a statement. 
Many hunters testified in favor of the bill sponsored by Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, though some joined the Game and Fish Department in opposing it. 
Other outdoors related bills signed this week include House Bill 1470 that raises the price of hunting, fishing and boating licenses, Senate Bill 2216 that creates a $5 waterfowl hunting stamp to pay for habitat improvement and Senate Bill 2245 that changes rules on hunting waterfowl from a boat.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A public university in Las Vegas, New Mexico is suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency, alleging the agency is illegally forcing it to jump through bureaucratic hoops before it can seek compensation for a wildfire in 2022 caused by the United States Forest Service.
New Mexico Highlands University, which has about 2,800 students, is seeking compensation from a $5.45 billion fund Congress created to fully compensate victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, the biggest fire in New Mexico history, which started due to two botched prescribed burns on federal land in early 2022. 
The wildfire burned more than 530 square miles and destroyed several hundred homes. It also upended life at the university, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday. The lawsuit does not provide a dollar figure, but it lists a variety of losses, including structural damage to university property from flooding and erosion; forced closures; increased insurance premiums; as well as emergency staffing costs for student support and operational expenses. 
Hermits Peak Fire victims say claims office head offered reassurances about Trump’s threatened cuts 

But rather than applying for compensation made available through the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, the university’s lawsuit says it is being required to first exhaust another means of covering some of those costs known as the FEMA Public Assistance program. 
That program is reserved for public entities like local governments and school districts seeking reimbursement for emergency and infrastructure costs they suffered during a disaster. 
It is also notoriously slow, requiring a seven-step approval process. 
“The Public Assistance program is a lengthy discretionary reimbursement program, not a compensation program, that is difficult to navigate, can take years to complete, and will not cover all of Plaintiff’s damages,” writes Brian Colón, a former state auditor and lawyer with Singleton Schreiber, which is suing on NMHU’s behalf. 
The City of New Orleans is still awaiting some Public Assistance funds from Hurricane Katrina funds in 2005, according to the lawsuit. Here in New Mexico, six bridges damaged in a 2008 flood in Ruidoso were still awaiting repairs by the time post-fire flooding occurred there last year, delays local officials attribute, in part, to Public Assistance challenges.
Flash floods poised to continue in disaster areas through monsoon season

And the state of New Mexico has awarded $170 million in zero-interest loans in recent years to local governments affected by various recent disasters, a measure meant to counteract delays associated with the FEMA program. 
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, approval for Public Assistance has also become less certain. This week, FEMA declined to cover 100% of the Public Assistance costs incurred from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and denied the state of Washington’s request for disaster assistance, including Public Assistance, following a bomb cyclone there last year.
Colón, in a brief interview Thursday, said he was unaware of any additional delays or denials for public entities affected by the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire since Trump took office. FEMA officials did not immediately respond to a comment about that or the lawsuit generally on Thursday.
The university is not the first public entity in and around the burn scar to sue FEMA for requiring the extra step. Other plaintiffs include the Mora-San Miguel Electrical Co-operative, Las Vegas City Schools, and the Mora Independent School District. Those cases are all still pending. 
As of April 15, the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Claims Office has paid out $2.25 billion in compensation to individuals, businesses, nonprofits and local governments, which amounts to about 41% of the $5.45 billion Congress awarded. That figure includes $137 million to local governments, most of which was a single payment of $98 million to the City of Las Vegas to replace its water treatment facilities.
The amount paid out via FEMA Public Assistance money is less clear. According to a FEMA website, the agency has obligated a little more than $170 million to local public entities that incurred costs related to the wildfire disaster in New Mexico in 2022. That money goes to public entities in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar but also other wildfires that erupted in the state in spring 2022, and it’s not clear how much has been actually paid, not just obligated, so far.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9288-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

According to state records, Jordan Nuno was employed by the Eighth Judicial District Department of Corrections as a full-time residential officer at the state-run Ottumwa Residential Facility from 2019 until January 2025, when he was fired.
The Ottumwa facility houses criminal offenders who have been ordered by the court to reside there as a condition of probation or parole. Nuno was tasked with supervising residents, taking periodic resident counts, and addressing any resident conduct issues.
According to the department, the final incident that triggered Nuno’s firing occurred on Dec. 18, 2024, as Nuno was making his rounds in a hallway at the Ottumwa Residential Facility. Based on video surveillance and witness statements, the department alleged that Nuno knowingly and intentionally shoulder-checked a resident of the facility, Jaden Miller, in an overt, unprovoked act of aggression.
Then, as Nuno continued down the hallway, Nuno allegedly directed a racial slur at resident Derek Winston, who is African American, and threatened to assault Winston and have him sanctioned or given jail time.
Nuno, the department alleged, then shoulder-checked Winston in another overt and unprovoked act of aggression, then shoved Winston against the wall.
According to the department, neither resident responded with violence. Immediately after the incident with Winston, Nuno allegedly informed a supervisor he had used force against a resident, and later told Resident Manager Charles Severs he was willing to “take a suspension” for doing so.
Later, when questioned by his superiors about shoulder-checking Miller, Nuno allegedly compared the residential facility to a prison and stated that Miller should have stepped aside as Nuno proceeded down the hallway. The department subsequently fired Nuno.
After he applied for unemployment benefits, Nuno participated in a fact-finding interview with Iowa Workforce Development and, according to an IWD administrative law judge, he “willfully misrepresented” the facts surrounding his dismissal.
“Essentially everything Mr. Nuno (said) was an intentionally false statement,” Administrative Law Judge James Timberland ruled. “Mr. Nuno asserted a resident suddenly approached him, called him a racial slur, and hit him,” and also asserted he was discharged because his manager is a racist, Timberland stated.
Based on the statements he had made to the IWD fact-finder in January, Nuno was awarded unemployment, and he subsequently collected $8,084 in benefits over a 12-week period.
After finding that Nuno misrepresented the facts related to his firing, Timberland recently ruled Nuno had “assaulted” residents of the Ottumwa facility and was ineligible for unemployment benefits. Nuno was ordered to repay the $8,084 in benefits already collected.
Court records show Nuno is currently facing a criminal charge of cruel treatment of a prisoner, a serious misdemeanor, as well as a simple-misdemeanor charge of assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and informed the court he intends to mount an affirmative defense of justification and self-defense. A jury trial on the cruel-treatment charge is scheduled for June 23, 2025.



Police officer, school teacher fired from their jobs
Other Iowans whose unemployment cases recently went before an administrative law judge include:
— Leon Spataru, who was fired from the City of Eldridge Police Department in January after the city concluded he was unfit for duty. According to the city, Spataru began working for the department in April 2024 as a full-time police officer.
In August, October and December of 2024 he allegedly told a supervisor he was anxious, fearing for his and his family’s safety, and was stressed to the point of feeling sick. An independent, third-party medical provider later conducted a psychological evaluation and concluded that Spataru was unable to consistently perform the essential functions of the job — after which the city fired him and challenged his application for unemployment benefits.
Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno ruled recently that Spataru is eligible for benefits since he had not committed workplace misconduct. “Failure in job performance due to inability or incapacity is not considered misconduct” because such actions are not voluntary, Zeno stated in his ruling.
— Joseph Vannatta, who worked as a high school band instructor for the Cherokee Community School District until he was fired in the spring of 2024. Police had alleged Vannatta “inserted himself in Snapchats” with a student and “continued to get personal” by engaging the student in explicit discussions of sex.
In July 2024, Vannatta pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment. Administrative Law Judge Sean Nelson subsequently found Vannatta was entitled to unemployment benefits, finding the school district had not “met its burden to describe the specific incidents that allegedly violated (state law)” or proven that Vannatta “used his authority to sexually exploit” a student.
The school district appealed that ruling and the state’s Employment Appeal Board recently reversed Nelson’s decision, stating that Vannatta “was charged with a crime and pled to an indictable offense factually related to that crime.” Because an aggravated misdemeanor, such as harassment, constitutes “gross misconduct,” the board ruled, Vannatta is ineligible for unemployment.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unemployment-benefits-form-with-rejected-stamp.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

(Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fourth-generation Middle Tennessee cattle farmer Cole Liggett lined up with scientists and environmental advocates in March to urge Tennessee lawmakers not to gut the state’s historically strong protections for wetlands.
Wetlands protection has been good business for Liggett. In addition to raising cattle, he’s a manager at Headwaters Reserve, a firm that developers pay to preserve and restore wetlands and streams so they can destroy them elsewhere, called mitigation banking. If lawmakers follow through on a plan to deregulate an estimated 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands, that will upend the industry in Tennessee and drive up prices for developers still required to pay for mitigation, Liggett testified.
Liggett works in a growing industry that operates more than 2,500 mitigation banks nationwide, earning an estimated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019, according to a 2023 study funded by the Ecological Restoration Business Association. 
The industry is built on demand spurred by the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, which requires developers to offset their damage to wetlands by building or restoring wetlands nearby.
But recent federal actions to shrink the scope of that law are pushing states to choose how strictly they will regulate wetlands. The consequences of those decisions not only threaten further degradation of land, water and wildlife, but also the fortunes of an industry that has made a big business out of conservation.

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from wetlands that don’t have a surface connection to navigable waters, which means bigger rivers and lakes. President Donald Trump’s administration has vowed to ease regulation, allowing developers to ditch and drain all but the wettest wetlands without permits or mitigation. Environmentalists fear that a recent order to speed up around 600 energy projects nationwide could limit requirements to compensate for the destruction of wetlands.
Some states, such as North Carolina and Indiana, have loosened regulations since the Sackett decision. In March, Kentucky lawmakers passed legislation to do the same, overriding Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
Tennessee’s wetlands regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act protections passed in the 1970s, but pending legislation could roll back much of that protection, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Tennessee Ecological Restoration Association, which represents Liggett and other mitigation bankers in Tennessee and the southeast, told the Tennessee Lookout that this will directly impact the growing mitigation industry. “We will see a decrease in demand for credits if aquatic resources are deregulated.”
Those concerns aren’t shared by everyone in mitigation banking. The national industry is more worried about the defunding of agencies that oversee banks and the prospect of a recession.

William Coleman’s California-based ecological consulting firm Eco-Asset Solutions and Innovations does much of its business in states that have active wetlands mitigation banking programs.
“My company has not seen any downturn in business,” Coleman, the firm’s founder and president, said. ‘Landowners are still very interested in the revenue opportunities mitigation banking offers.”
Protection limits risk industry investments
Just outside of Memphis, a chorus of frogs on a roughly 250-acre tract of former farmland nearly drowns out the traffic on nearby Austin Peay Highway. Environmental consulting firm EnSafe planted about 54,000 trees on the once flood-prone fields in 2018 and will be responsible for its upkeep until the wetland is mature and healthy – anywhere from seven to 10 years. After that, the land will go to a partnering land trust, where it will be conserved in perpetuity.
“Granted, there is a business piece to what we do, but restoring things to the way they were is also pretty cool … There will be a pocket here forever,” EnSafe principal Paul Stoddard said.
The West Tennessee Wetlands Mitigation Bank has sold credits to Amazon to offset a new delivery center in Fayette County. A contractor purchased credits to compensate for a 2-million-square-foot distribution facility called “Project Iron Giant,” according to records kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the federal agencies tasked with overseeing wetlands regulations.
TERA estimates that mitigation businesses have poured more than $1 billion into around 130 mitigation bank investments across Tennessee.
“The beauty of mitigation credits is that the developer just writes a check and they’re done. All the monitoring and reporting and maintenance and stuff is up to the bank,” EnSafe Senior Ecologist Jimmy Groton said.
That process makes mitigation banking a high-risk industry, according to Liggett. Regardless of whether they sell credits, banks are required to maintain their wetlands for at least seven years. The proposed regulatory rollback on Tennessee’s wetlands would mean an 80% decrease in demand for mitigation businesses, he testified to Tennessee lawmakers on March 26.
“Such a drastic decrease in the demand after such a high investment … has potential to drive up credit prices as a necessity to avoid potential financial insolvencies,” Liggett said.
Hillary Bonham, a principal at environmental consulting firm Baetis Restoration Partners, has experience as both a residential developer and mitigation banker. She told Tennessee lawmakers that the current average price of a credit in Tennessee is around $50,000. Reducing regulations and hampering demand will likely cause the credits that remain to be “exponentially more expensive when they are needed.”
In Georgia, where isolated wetlands are not regulated, a single credit can range from $750,000 to $1.1 million according to the Georgia Alabama Land Trust In Lieu Fee Program, Bonham said.

States can protect isolated wetlands
Mitigation banks have been the preferred way to offset wetland destruction for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps since 2008, and the industry has ballooned rapidly since the first entrepreneurial banks were established in the early 1990s.
John Paul Woodley, Jr. helped issue the Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 mitigation rule while serving as assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. He’s also the immediate past chair of the board of the National Environmental Banking Association, a trade association with around 100 members nationwide.
Some people expected to see the Sackett decision have a dramatic impact on mitigation banking, he said, but two limiting factors prevented a panic within the industry.
First, when the decision was made, developers already well into the permit process could either choose to move forward under the previous terms or go back to the drawing board. Most businesses didn’t want to start over, so many pending permits under review by the Corps proceeded as though nothing had happened, Woodley said.
Second, states have significant control over the regulation of state waters.
“Many states have just said, ‘We don’t care about that. We have our own jurisdiction, and we’re not limited by what the Clean Water Act says is the waters of the United States … If the U.S. doesn’t want to protect those waters, that’s fine and dandy. We will,’” Woodley said.
Some states have more isolated wetlands than others, he added, and those states will have to decide whether to protect those resources. Woodley thinks they ultimately will.
Generally, coastal wetlands will maintain federal protection because of their connection to the navigable waters of the ocean. But experts fear that some swamps and marshlands, once protected, may now face development due to human-made flood-control structures, such as levees or berms, that could be construed as legal separations between wetlands and waters of the U.S.
Trump pushes to expedite wetlands permitting
President Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” led the Corps to fast-track review for more than 600 permits. 
Environmental advocates say that could come at the expense of wetlands. 
“Any damages to wetlands due to this emergency must be mitigated properly,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit advocating for communities along the Gulf Coast. “For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.”
Those in the industry see other actions by the administration as slowing down environmental permitting, posing a different kind of threat. Trump’s first administration made funding cuts to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps that ultimately increased the time it took to review pending permits. Longer review periods can mean less return on investment for landowners, Coleman said.
“That meant there were just not enough bodies to review the applications that were on the table … so there was a tremendous delay,” he said. 
Coleman’s company found that an average two- to three-year review period stretched into four or five years during Trump’s first term. 
Woodley said demand for mitigation banks is driven largely by development pressure. In Virginia, where he’s based, data centers are a big contributor. Some of the mitigation banking industry’s biggest customers are state transportation departments and the oil and gas industry—roadways and pipelines often have less flexibility to build elsewhere.
“Anything that takes place that causes an economic downturn, that causes people to retrench and postpone their development plans … that’s the risk to the mitigation industry,” Woodley said. “They had a very difficult time around 2008 … the number of permits applied for declined, and at the same time, the number of the requirements for mitigation took a downturn.”
In Gulf States like Louisiana, which is home to 40% of wetlands in the continental U.S. and has sustained 80% of national wetland losses, environmental advocates warn about the consequences of filling in wetlands through emergency permitting without ensuring proper mitigation. 
“We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks,” said Kristen Schlemmer, senior legal director of the Bayou City Waterkeeper, a nonprofit working to protect communities impacted by water pollution and flooding in Houston.
Some wetlands mitigation banking businesses have begun to diversify their offerings to include conservation-based credits for protecting the habitats of endangered species, carbon sequestration or nutrient banking to prevent excessive runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus.

(Screenshot via Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in a case that could determine whether a state law on underground carbon dioxide storage is constitutional and fair to landowners. 
The Northwest Landowners Association and other landowners are suing the state of North Dakota and the state Industrial Commission over a state law that can force landowners to take part in an underground CO2 storage project. 
Joining the state in defending its statute are Minnkota Power, Basin Electric Power, Dakota Gasification Co. and Summit Carbon Solutions, the Iowa-based company that has a permit to store millions of tons of carbon dioxide in western North Dakota.
Initial fate of property rights lawsuit now in the hands of a judge

The North Dakota Farm Bureau has joined the landowners in their lawsuit. 
Derrick Braaten, representing the landowners, said the state law authorizing amalgamation — forcing landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if 60% of the landowners agree to a storage project — is unconstitutional and doesn’t allow landowners to use the court system to argue for just compensation. 
Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson dismissed the lawsuit in August, ruling that a law passed in 2009 could not be challenged because a statute of limitations had expired.  Thursday’s arguments delved into the merits of the case. 
Braaten urged the Supreme Court to overrule the district court on the technicalities. He said the Supreme Court could also rule on the merits of the case or send it back to the district court for further arguments. 
The Supreme Court took the case under advisement. 
Judge dismisses landowner lawsuit against state, citing procedural issues

Summit Carbon Solutions is seeking to use property in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties for underground CO2 storage. The underground storage area is referred to as pore space.
Phil Axt, representing the state, noted that North Dakota’s geology is exceptionally well suited to underground carbon dioxide storage. He said the state should have the authority to regulate a shared resource. 
He said the case could set a precedent. 
“As far as we’re aware, no other court has yet addressed the pooling of pore space interests and the interplay between individual rights, majority rights and regulatory authority,” Axt said. “We think courts around the country will be answering them, but this court is positioned to be the first.” 
Paul Forster, attorney for Minnkota Power, argued that allowing a small percentage of landowners to stop an underground storage project denies the majority of a right to profit from their property. 
Braaten also argued that state law takes away the right of landowners to challenge the level of compensation if a landowner is forced into a pool. 
He noted the potential revenue for Summit Carbon Solutions if it is able to take advantage of federal tax credit for storing carbon dioxide, which the company hopes to gather from ethanol plants in five Midwest states. 
“They’re making millions, if not billions, of dollars doing it by collecting government tax credits, and they’re saying we don’t get our share of that, even though it’s our property they’re using,” Braaten said. 
Carbon pipeline company seeks dismissals of North Dakota court challenges

About 92% of landowners in the 90,000-acre sequestration area for Summit were participating voluntarily at the time Summit’s storage permit was approved.
Summit Carbon Solutions, which faces a permitting challenge in South Dakota, did not make oral arguments Thursday. Among the arguments Summit made in a brief filed with the court is that the state has a law that forces property owners to participate in oil and gas development.
Braaten argued those property owners are fairly compensated. 
The Northwest Landowners Association successfully challenged a 2019 North Dakota pore space law at the state Supreme Court, with justices finding it unconstitutional. 
Landowners are also appealing the Industrial Commission’s permit decision for the Summit storage area.

Free.,Van Hollen: El Salvador soldiers blocked wellness check of wrongly deported man,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/van-hollen-el-salvador-soldiers-blocked-wellness-check-wrongly-deported-man,,"U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Thursday that soldiers blocked him from entering a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador where the erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia has been held for more than a month.The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness. He met with El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa that day, who denied his requests to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.Van Hollen told reporters Thursday afternoon that he again tried to make contact with Abrego Garcia that morning.A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 finding that sending Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, back to his home country would put him in grave danger.Accompanied by Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — Van Hollen said they tried to enter Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, but soldiers stopped them at a checkpoint about three kilometers from the prison.“We were told by the soldiers that they’d been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he has not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls, and “this inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law.”The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.Appeals court slams administration’s inactionMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.The unanimous ruling was written by Fourth Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.In unusually frank language, the Fourth Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”Neither country taking actionThe Fourth Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

Vincent is the first Democratic challenger to file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for any of South Carolina’s 2026 congressional races. Three Democrats, as well as one Republican, have done so to oppose longtime U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.
The 7th District, anchored in fast-growing Horry County, has been represented by GOP Rep. Russell Fry since 2022, when he ousted Republican Tom Rice, who angered Republicans in the ruby red district for voting to impeach President Donald Trump in 2021. Fry’s office did not immediately respond to email and phone messages from the Gazette.
“Congressman Fry is doing an awesome job and the party is proud of all he has been able to accomplish!” Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for the state Republican Party said in response to Fry’s challenger.
Vincent said he recognizes he has an uphill battle in a district dominated by Republicans. A Democrat last held the 7th District in the early 1930s, when it dissolved with the state’s loss of population at the time, and its location in the state was completely different.
The closest a Democrat has gotten to winning the seat since South Carolina gained it back with the 2010 census was in 2012, the first election with the recrafted 7th District. That year, Democrat Gloria Bromell Tinubu received 44% of the vote to Rice.
Fry won re-election in November with 65% of the vote, the most decisive win for the seat this century.
“Our turnout has not been strong. Apathy has been high,” Vincent said of Democrats.
“In order to win, about 15% of people who voted for my opponent are going to have to vote for me,” he added. “Not stay home, but vote for me.”
Vincent pointed out that the Pee Dee region struggles with poverty. Chesterfield, Marlboro, Dillon and Marion counties are among the state’s poorest, according to the most recent numbers from the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Vincent said he can represent those voters as someone who understands the challenges of day-to-day life.
“I’ve never been rich, and I’ve been lucky to never be poor,” he said.
Vincent says on his campaign website that he’s struggled with alcoholism (he’s more than two decades sober) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
He hopes transparency and a desire to be represented by an “average Joe” will carry him past Fry, who was a state legislator and lawyer before ascending to national politics.
Vincent called his ability to connect with people his “superpower.”
Vincent will hold town halls twice a month until the November 2026 election, he said.
He described himself as an advocate of abortion rights, saying those decisions should be fully up to patients and their doctor.
He also wrote a book with his wife about leadership through diversity and inclusion that draws on lessons from his time in the military. He’s in favor of a pathway to citizenship for immigrants without proper authorization — as long as they don’t have a criminal record. He says gender is each person’s own business.
He also supports a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage. South Carolina doesn’t have a state minimum wage, so the minimum is set by the federal standard, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.
Vincent said those views aren’t too liberal for South Carolina, where voters in November gave the Legislature their largest GOP majority since Reconstruction and no Democrat has won any statewide office since 2006. He believes the reason Democrats have failed is because they haven’t focused on the economic issues that matter most to voters.
“That’s why the middle class is going ‘ehhh, I need a job here,’” he said. “It just seems like they don’t really understand what’s going on in our life.”
He then pointed to his campaign slogan: “Warrior-advocate for the middle class and most vulnerable.”
It’s not a cliche; it genuinely represents him, he said.
He carries a concealed weapon and wants to invest in technology to make the border stronger, he told the Gazette. “Core pillars” of his campaign include protecting veterans, as well as federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that are intended to help the working class cover necessary costs.
While Vincent, who owns a leadership and organizational consulting firm, condemns the aggressive slashing of jobs touted by President Donald Trump and spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, a balanced budget is another “core pillar” of his campaign, he says.
“You do it strategically,” Vincent said. You do it in a “way that’s responsible,” adding that his company helps other businesses operate efficiently.
During his own town hall Wednesday, Fry said he will continue being one of Trump’s biggest allies in congress, The Sun News reported.
“This district is a very conservative district, and that’s what they elected me to do. And he has not wasted any time in getting our country back on track,” the 40-year-old incumbent said.
Fry has $625,000 available in his campaign account, according to his latest Federal Election Commission filings.
Vincent officially filed his campaign paperwork on March 13 and had $7,500 at the end of the month. He said his campaign is up to $30,000 as of Thursday. He estimates he’ll need only $300,000 to win, saying he knows he won’t be able to outspend Fry and doesn’t need to.
“You don’t need a million and a half (dollars),” he said. “If you’re willing to connect with people and you’re willing to tell the truth, even though they may not like it, that’s how you do it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/John-Vincent_headshot.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

The gift also endows and renames the Nuremberg to The Hague (N2H) Program in honor of Howard A. Kaiman, a Creighton alumnus.
Samuel and Ida Kaiman, both Omaha natives, were Donna’s parents. Howard, a lifelong Omahan and attorney, was Donna’s brother. Family members said Howard took night law classes at Creighton in the 1960s, during an antisemitic period when Jews were being denied by country clubs and colleges.
Before he died in 2023 at age 93, Howard Kaiman asked his family to distribute his estate to worthy causes.

Donna (Kaiman) Gilbert, in a media statement, said the program funding would help continue the good deeds and community work carried out by her parents and brother. She also said the new center and the N2H program would help keep the memory of the Holocaust alive for new generations. The Nazi regime and their allies killed about 6 million Jewish people in the genocide known as the Holocaust, 1933 to 1945.
“They will challenge them never to forget that this happened and that it can happen again, very easily, if we don’t remember,” said Gilbert.
Michael Kelly, Creighton law professor and director of N2H, said the endowment and center have “forever changed how we teach the Holocaust, genocide and international criminal justice at Creighton.”
Every summer for more than a decade, the N2H program has taken up to 30 students to Germany, the Netherlands and Poland to learn firsthand about the Holocaust. The news release describes the program as an immersion into historical and legal experiences that combine classroom instruction with trips to crime scenes, places of conspiracy and trials for crimes against humanity being litigated today.

The endowment ensures the perpetuity of the N2H program, Creighton officials said, and the new research hub builds upon and broadens its impact and influence.
“The center also provides us the invaluable opportunity to explore more deeply the international atrocities taking place today, and the courts tasked with litigating them,” Kelly said.
He said the center could bring in world-renowned attorneys to speak about genocide litigation, explore cases being tried in the International Criminal Court of Justice and examine the genocide of the Rohingya in Burma, the Kurds in Iraq and other repressed people worldwide.

(Photo courtesy of Mark Gocke)This story was first published by WyoFile on April 10, 2025.
A dismayed Chris Servheen is raising the alarm about what’s become of federal scientists who have kept watch over the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly bear population for the last 55 years.
The group of research biologists and technicians, known as the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, are being hamstrung at best and arguably dismantled, he told WyoFile. For decades, until his retirement in 2016, Sevheen worked closely with the study team while coordinating grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“It’s functionally destroying the organization,” Servheen said April 3. “The study team has been in place since 1970 — over 50 years of work and experience and knowledge. It’s going to just disappear and die.”

Servheen’s perplexed about what the Trump administration has to gain.
“How could anybody be so negligent and vile that they’re trying to destroy something that has brought grizzly bears back from the edge of extinction?” he said. “Why would you do that? It’s just so destructive.”
Led by Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling started with a hiring freeze. Longtime supervisory wildlife biologist Mark Haroldson retired, and his position is not being filled, according to Servheen. Then, the team’s longtime leader, Frank van Manen, announced an earlier-than-desired retirement.
“He didn’t want to leave,” Servheen said of van Manen, who declined to comment.

According to Servheen, van Manen’s departure was related to the federal government’s ongoing upheaval.
“They’re putting fear into people,” Servheen said. “That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”
 What are the responsibilities of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team?

The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, and its website lists four other employees. Three are technicians, which are often seasonal, entry-level employees. The remaining staff biologist has been in the job about three years.










“They’re putting fear into people. That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”

If any of the study team’s employees opt to stick it out amid a second wave of buyouts, they’re likely to be out of an office space come fall. The Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, described by its director as “one of the nation’s key laboratories to study the ecosystems and species of the Northern Rockies,” is one of hundreds of federal facilities being shuttered by DOGE.
Although located in Bozeman, many of the federal facility’s researchers do work in Wyoming.
“They do all kinds of other stuff: brucellosis and chronic wasting disease and aquatic species,” Servheen said. “It’s a huge science center.”
The planned closure has elicited protests. According to Yellowstonian.org, 42 retired or active biologists petitioned Montana’s congressional delegation to use their influence to “protect [the science center] and its employees from these unwarranted attacks by DOGE.”
Federal offices located in Wyoming have not escaped the closures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s tribal-focused Lander conservation office and a USGS Cheyenne water science station are among those that have been marked for the chopping block.
WyoFile could not officially confirm impacts to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Federal agencies under the Trump administration have declined or not responded to WyoFile’s requests for more information on downsizing and office closures. An inquiry to a USGS public affairs officer on Thursday yielded no information about the matter.
The Center for Biological Diversity has been pressing the federal agency for details as well. On Thursday, the environmental advocacy organization publicized a Freedom of Information Act request to gain more insight into the future of the federal grizzly team.
Both recently departed veteran study team members — van Manen and Haroldson — are staying engaged in grizzly science in pro-bono emeritus roles, according to a source familiar with the situation.

 The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery

Nevertheless, Servheen worries that the hit to the science team could trickle down to the grizzly population — estimated at 1,000 or so bears in the Greater Yellowstone — that it’s charged with studying.
Over the decades, federal researchers have played a pivotal role in improving understanding of the region’s bruins, including completing studies that have helped make the case that grizzly bears are fully recovered and no longer require Endangered Species Act protection. They’ve also amassed mortality and other demographic datasets and compiled an annual report.
“The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery has been built on science,” Servheen said. “Removing that science eliminates our ability to maintain Yellowstone grizzly bears.”

The leadership award was created in 2015 by ICAN and Kiewit Corp. to recognize leaders who live and lead through collaboration, compassion, confidence and creativity.
Brewer over 28 years has risen from Habitat volunteer to CEO.
“Through her efforts to increase affordable housing and empower families to achieve homeownership, Amanda Brewer is setting the standard for how leaders can ideate, collaborate and break down barriers,” said Aileen Warren, CEO of ICAN.
Brewer’s nomination recognized her collaborative approach. Recent examples cited in a news release include a partnership with Metonic Real Estate Solutions and Apogee Professional Services to create apartments and affordable homes in northwest Omaha that will be in reach of workers. Habitat also hosts clinics on transferring deeds that helped 362 families secure nearly $77 million in generational wealth.
Through a donation from MacKenzie Scott’s Yield Giving fund, Brewer also is helping to establish a coalition among Habitat for Humanity affiliates across the state to address workforce and affordable housing needs.
Habitat Omaha is described as the nation’s top Habitat affiliate based on the number of people it serves. Agency goals include wealth-building, reducing the impact of out-of-state investors who buy properties in Nebraska, payday lending reform and vacant and rental property registration.
Said Brewer: “We know the need for affordable housing is great, and our commitment to making a meaningful impact is stronger than ever.”

Laura Kelly, who signed a bill in May 2022 legalizing sports betting in Kansas, placed the state's first bet in September of that year on the Kansas City Chiefs.(Submitted)TOPEKA — Approval of a last-minute addition to Kansas’ state budget took the gambling and sports betting sphere by surprise, leaving the future of the industry in the state uncertain.
The Kansas Legislature Friday passed the state budget bill, which included a provision that bans the Kansas Lottery, the agency that oversees gambling in the state, from spending state money to negotiate any renewals, extensions or new contracts with sports wagering operators until July 2026.
Jeremy Kudon, a lobbyist who had a hand in ushering in gambling’s new era of sports wagering in the United States, took to the social media platform X to assure bettors that their online sports betting operators would remain in Kansas — for now.
“Just want to clarify: None of the leading OSB operators in Kansas will go dark as a result of today’s vote,” Kudon wrote in a post.
Most contracts with the state lottery are valid until 2027, he said.
“But I wouldn’t let the Kansas legislature off so easy. They had no idea when these contracts expired and were willing to take your favorite OSB apps away from Kansans. We’re not going to let that happen,” Kudon wrote.
Kansans over 21 years old can bet on badminton, bull riding and 50 other categories of live and virtual sports. Since 2022, after the passage of Senate Bill 84, the state recruited six sports wager operators: BetMGM, Caesar’s, DraftKings, ESPNBet, FanDuel and Fanatics. Each of those contracts, which include retail and mobile betting, are set to expire at the same time in August 2027.
Historically, the Kansas Lottery negotiated the contracts and went through an approval process with the Kansas Attorney General’s Office.
The Legislature’s moratorium, which will apply to fiscal years 2025 and 2026, could open up Kansas’ sports betting market to new regulations or more influence from state lawmakers if they decide to take up the issue in the 2026 session. Among possible changes, one option is an increase in the share of money the state collects from sports wagering revenues. The state currently collects 10% of all revenue from both mobile and retail platforms. 
Sports wagering is legal in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Missouri voters narrowly approved in November a constitutional amendment to legalize sports betting online, in casinos and in certain districts near major sports arenas. The rollout was scheduled for this summer, but the state has delayed it until the fall to allow for time to straighten out licensing rules.
Legalized gambling in Kansas dates back to 1986, when more than 60% of voters approved a constitutional amendment to establish a state-run lottery. A year later, the Legislature passed the Kansas Lottery Act. 
The Legislature this year authorized a gaming compact between the governor’s office and the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska to allow sports betting at the Sac & Fox Casino in Powhattan. In 2024, the Legislature approved a sports betting compact for the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska’s White Cloud Casino in White Cloud and did the same in 2023 for the Prairie Band Casino Resort in Mayetta, which is owned by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kelly-sports-gambling.png,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

(Getty Images)Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball plans to investigate how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis (OMC) processed license applications, she announced Thursday. 
Ball’s office will be “examining OMC’s business license application and award processes,” her office said. 
“My office has continued to receive complaints about how the Office of Medical Cannabis administered the lottery process for awarding medical cannabis business licenses,” Ball, a Republican, said in a statement. “Kentuckians should have confidence that state offices operate with transparency and integrity, and my office is committed to ensuring those standards.”
Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said “no one has filed a legal claim challenging Kentucky’s medical cannabis laws or the Office of Medical Cannabis’ regulations.”
“Throughout the entire process we have been committed to transparency, which is why the lottery process was streamed live and online,” Staley said. “The individuals who have come forward to express ‘concerns’ went through the full process and did not complain until after not being selected in the lottery.” 
In 2023, the legislature legalized medical marijuana for Kentuckians suffering from chronic illnesses. Last year, the bipartisan House Bill 829 became law and moved up the medical cannabis licensing timeline from January 2025 to July 1, 2024. 
During the application period, which was July 1–Aug. 31, the state received 4,998 applications for medical cannabis business licenses, including 918 cultivator and processor applications. 
Patients who qualify for medical cannabis are those with a history of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cancer or other approved medical conditions. 
The Kentucky Lottery Corporation ran the license lottery. 
Beshear said Thursday during his weekly press conference that “more than 12,000 Kentuckians have received a written certification and more than 8,000 have successfully applied for and received a medical cannabis card” since January.

Raj Mukherji intends to crack down on people who threaten judges at a time when judges say attacks on them are growing. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state senator wants to toughen penalties against people who threaten judges and prosecutors in New Jersey, with attacks on judges escalating as the Trump administration feuds with courts from coast to coast.
Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson) said he was driven to act after U.S. District Judge Esther Salas revealed recently that judges around the U.S. have received unsolicited pizza deliveries sent in the name of her son Daniel Anderl, who was gunned down in 2020 at the family’s home by an angry litigant.
“These are unprecedented attacks on judicial officers,” Salas told MSNBC in several weekend appearances on the news network.
Under a bill Mukherji plans to introduce, it would become a second-degree crime — with a presumption of incarceration — to threaten, harass, intimidate, or dox local, county, state and federal judges and prosecutors over their work performance.
The offense would be upgraded to a first-degree crime if it occurs at or within 500 feet of the home of a prosecutor, judge, or their immediate family members. That includes sending items or messages to a home protected under Daniel’s Law, which legislators passed after Anderl’s murder to prohibit the disclosure of public officials’ home addresses and phone numbers.
“In a democracy, disagreement is fair game, but intimidation and violence are not. They must be confronted swiftly and without hesitation with the full weight of the law,” Mukherji said in a statement. “Judges and prosecutors must be free to perform their public duties without looking over their shoulders or worrying about the safety of their families. At a time when the independence of the judiciary is under attack and violence is on the rise, we must draw a hard line to protect those who serve justice.”
President Donald Trump, administration officials, and some members of Congress have personally attacked judges they disagree with in recent weeks on social media and in personal appearances.
That has resulted in a sharp uptick in threats to judges, including pizza deliveries to jurists’ homes by people who have “weaponized” Anderl’s name, Salas said. The ominous deliveries send a clear message, she added: “Do you want to end up like Judge Salas? Do you want to end up like her son?”
She urged other states to shield judges’ personally identifiable information, as New Jersey legislators did with Daniel’s Law, and officials at all levels to condemn attacks on the judiciary.
“Whether it be attacks that come in the form of some of our members of Congress calling for our impeachment because we’re doing our jobs, members of this administration calling us rogue, calling us crazy, leftist, unconstitutional judges, or coming in the forms of these acts of intimidation, these are unprecedented times that really call for us to speak up for the judiciary, to speak up for justice,” Salas said.

Bahl has missed 10 days of the legislative session. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers will be paid at least $41,500 for absences during the 2025 legislative session so far, though most legislators with more than a handful of missed days said they were due to family or medical reasons, military service or their jobs.
Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, said earlier this week she felt singled out by criticism from the House majority leader over taking five days off to go on a vacation. Five lawmakers have missed six or more days during the legislative session, including VanWinkle, who has missed  seven days of the session.
In total, 84 lawmakers of the Legislature’s combined 141-member body were absent for at least one day since the session began in early January. They accumulated 195 missed legislative days as of Thursday, according to Legislative Council. The North Dakota Monitor excluded from the analysis the absences of Rep. Josh Christy, who died in office in February.
North Dakota lawmaker defends absence as she’s urged to go without pay for vacation

Legislators are paid for days they are absent unless they ask Legislative Council to withhold their pay, said Legislative Council Director John Bjornson. They are paid $213 per calendar day during the legislative session, with committee chairs and other leadership positions earning slightly more. That’s in addition to a monthly salary of $592.
Rep. Landon Bahl, R-Grand Forks, has missed the most with 10 days, according to Legislative Council. Bahl missed the week of March 31 to lobby for fraternities in Washington, D.C., on business not related to the state Legislature, but will receive $1,065 in legislative pay for those five days.
Bahl also has missed days for reasons related to his job. He said his situation is unique because he is the chief operating officer for 322 Hospitality Group, which oversees more than 250 employees across eight different restaurants, hotels and event centers.
“District 17 voted me in as a business operator,” Bahl said. “I always have two laptops because I’m constantly emailing … and bouncing back and forth because that’s my job and this is a part-time citizen Legislature.”

On Monday, House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he suggested that VanWinkle voluntarily give back the $1,065 in legislative pay she received while on a family vacation. Lefor said he didn’t have the authority to withhold a lawmaker’s pay.
House and Senate rules, however, appear to conflict with state statute. 
North Dakota Century Code states members of the Legislature are “entitled” to receive compensation. 
But House and Senate rules state legislators may not be absent during an entire day “unless unable to attend due to illness or other cause.” The rules also say “no one is entitled to draw pay while absent more than one day without leave.”
Lefor and Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, referred questions on the rules to Bjornson.
Bjornson said he was unsure when the absence rules were first added to the chamber rule books, but they were included in every rule book going as far back as 1957, the oldest rule book on his office shelf.
The presiding officer of the chamber, either the speaker of the House or the president of the Senate, signs payment vouchers for the lawmakers, Bjornson said. If the presiding officer and the majority leader of the chamber told the Legislative Council not to pay someone, they would follow that direction, Bjornson said.
North Dakota lawmakers serve up to 80 days every two years. Thursday was day 64 of the session.
Lefor said earlier this week he thinks it’s inappropriate for a lawmaker to take vacation during a legislative session. VanWinkle defended her absence to spend time with her family and said she thinks the criticism is unfair. She declined additional comment on Wednesday.

Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, has missed nine days during the legislative session. Absences early in the session were due to the death of her father. More recently, she said she has missed days to drive her mother from Rolette to Bismarck for medical appointments.
“As much as I want a vacation, I’m here to do a job that I was elected to do,” Davis said. “Unless it’s literally life or death, it’s probably the only reason I would miss.”
Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, and Rep. Matt Ruby, R-Minot, have each missed six days.
Mitskog said her absences were related to medical reasons for herself and her family. She said her husband is battling cancer that requires appointments in Minneapolis and she attends when possible so she can ask questions. Her elderly mother also needed to be driven to appointments in Fargo that were set up months in advance.
“They weren’t vacation days,” Mitskog said.
Ruby said his absences were due to National Guard training and because his son had surgery. He said he communicated every absence to chamber leadership, which he said is important for planning which bills come to the floor for votes.
“I certainly wasn’t taking vacation,” Ruby said.
Ruby said he does not think the policy surrounding legislative absences needs to be changed because he doesn’t believe people are abusing it, for the most part.
“Sometimes you have doctor’s appointments you have to get done,” Ruby said. “Sometimes you shouldn’t be sitting shoulder to shoulder with someone if you are sick … but it’s expected to be here if you can, and we’re all adults here.”

(Pool photo by Kristen Murphy/Deseret News)After dozens of international students had their visas revoked in Utah, Gov. Spencer Cox asked the Trump administration for more information on the criteria officials are using to select the students who seem to have to suddenly leave the country, some without finishing their programs. 
Since many of the students and universities didn’t receive notices on their status change, Cox also asked the federal government for a “little bit of a heads up when these things are happening,” he said during his monthly news conference broadcast by PBS Utah.

“We’d like to understand better what the criteria are for those changes. Certainly, we know that there were some that had criminal backgrounds that we were not aware of, that the universities were not aware of,” Cox said. “(With) others, that does not appear to be the case, and so we would very much like to figure that out.”
Officers from all public universities in Utah reported over 50 cases of students that had their visas revoked or their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records terminated. Many didn’t release much information to protect the students’ privacy. But, the University of Utah, host of 20 of the impacted students, specified that approximately half of the affected students are from China, a spokesperson said in an email. The other half are from several countries including India and some Middle Eastern countries.
Dozens of international University of Utah students had visas revoked

At Brigham Young University, a private Utah institution, a student from Japan had his visa revoked, potentially for a fishing licensing violation that happened years ago and was dismissed, according to the Deseret News. 
The wave of visa revocations has instilled confusion on campuses throughout the country. 
At the University of Utah “a few university students’ changes in status have not been connected to a clear, specific interaction with law enforcement,” leaders of the institution said in a statement. And none were flagged for participating in protests, a spokesperson said.
There are many unanswered questions still about these cases, but in the meantime, Cox said he hopes the country can keep on attracting talent from abroad, referring to past comments from President Donald Trump on his interest to bring bright minds to American institutions. 
“We know how important those visas are and how important immigrants are to building our economy,” Cox said. 
For the time being the Trump administration hasn’t gotten back to the governor, but, Cox said, there are ongoing conversations on how to keep attracting international students while checking their backgrounds.



Let us know what you think...


 


“It’s important that we vet those who come, that we make sure we understand their backgrounds, that they don’t pose any threats, that they’re supportive of our country and the work that’s being done here,” Cox said. “And then it’s important that we get them and we keep them.”
When asked on whether there’s a constitutional crisis with the Trump administration ignoring orders to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to a prison in El Salvador, even though he was shielded from deportation in 2019, Cox said that this is an interesting constitutional struggle.
“The problem with this is there’s just no nuance in the discussions. It’s like, either you hate the Constitution, or you want terrorists living in America, it seems like those are the two choices,” Cox said.
But, there may be a third option, he added. One in which Abrego Garcia returns to get through the process to get deported again. 
“It really does matter that we hold to these constitutional norms, but pushing the boundaries of those norms is the prerogative, and was intended (…) It’s not the worst thing to challenge those norms, see where the lines are and then work within those lines,” he said.”

Trump and his administration.
Hundreds of protestors at the University of Connecticut and Yale University gathered to oppose what they called an attack on higher education — including recent suspensions of research funding, cancellations of international student visas and what some see as a failure on the part of local officials to respond.
Chants of “Hands off our university!” rung out.

At Yale, roughly 500 faculty, students and community members gathered on the quad known as Cross Campus. Attendees held signs reading “Protect higher ed everywhere” and “Education not deportation.” About 60 miles northeast, more than 200 people at UConn’s Storrs campus participated in a similar effort, part of a national “Day of Action for Higher Ed,” organized locally by chapters of the American Association of University Professors.
According to organizers, the “day of action” included more than 175 gatherings around the country, including at Harvard University which has recently been at the center of standoffs with the Trump administration after threats to end the university’s ability to enroll international students and revoke its tax-exempt status.
“As we see universities across this nation speaking to our shared values, I know more than that ignorance is deadly, but that courage is contagious,” Phillip Atiba Solomon, chair of Yale’s department of African American studies, said while addressing the crowd in New Haven.
In Storrs, Chris Vials, an English professor and union president of UConn-AAUP, said, “We are facing a federal government that wants to do us harm, a federal government that is deporting students from this campus, a federal government that is cutting life saving research, a federal government that hates diversity … and a federal government that’s not even obeying the law.”
The rallies come as details emerge about international students at colleges and universities around the country seeing their visa status terminated by the Trump administration. In Connecticut, more than 50 students have had their visas revoked.
“The truth is students and workers across campus are scared for themselves and their friends, scared to go to class in case they get abducted by ICE, scared to be associated with anything vaguely political, scared to be here today,” said Lily Lou, a UConn political science graduate student. 
“How are any of us expected to learn, teach or work in these conditions?” Lou said.

Student visas
Earlier this week, UConn confirmed that 13 students had their visas revoked, including six undergraduates, six graduate students and one person in a post-graduate professional program. The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, which represents 14 higher education institutions, said at least 40 visas had been terminated among students at its member schools — which include Yale University, Trinity College, Quinnipiac University and Wesleyan University.
The revocations are part of a government effort that has left hundreds of students across the country at risk for deportation.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Thursday he’d sent a letter to the Trump administration demanding details on how many visas had been revoked and guidance on what those students should do next.
“There’s been no due process, no apparent rights of appeal, no disclosure by this administration,” Blumenthal said on Thursday morning during a press conference at New Haven City Hall before heading to UConn to share similar sentiments. “I want the facts and I want the revocations to stop until they come clean with the American people about why these revocations are taking place.”

Later in the day, faculty at Yale described what they see as a “chilling effect” the administration’s actions have had on institutions of higher learning. 
“Who is safe in this environment?” Kishwar Rizvi, a professor at the school of architecture, asked the crowd.
At UConn, Alexander Blagojevic, a biomedical engineering graduate student at UConn, echoed sentiments from Blumenthal and Rizvi. “The brightest minds in the world used to dream about coming here and calling this country home because they knew that this was a place you could come to make a difference,” he said.
“Now, all they dream about is jumping ship.”

Sen. Henri Martin, R-Bristol, ranking member of the Connecticut legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, said Blumenthal “is seeking more information from DHS and the State Department about the revocations. He is right to pursue that clarity and get the facts in order to ensure fairness in the process, as our colleges continue to monitor the situation and provide guidance for students.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said in a joint statement that they “stand with the UConn and Yale communities and share their outrage at the unprecedented and ongoing Republican attacks on higher education, scientific research, freedom of speech, and human rights.”
“The students and faculty who are protesting in peaceful defiance of these senseless and often cruel actions should be commended for their conviction,” the joint statement read.

Research funding
Rally-goes and lawmakers also spoke out about the Trump administration’s cuts to scientific research funding. 
The National Institutes of Health has terminated nearly 800 research grants at academic institutions across the country. Last month, NIH announced that the funding it provides to grantees for “indirect costs” — like laboratory, utility and administrative personnel costs — would be limited to 15% of the grant award. Currently, the average indirect cost rate is between 27% and 28%, though some organizations have rates that are much higher, according to the agency.
Connecticut joined 21 other states in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration shortly after the cuts were announced. In April, a federal judge permanently blocked implementation of the cuts, but the administration is now appealing that decision. 
Blumenthal spoke about the critical role that NIH funding has played in advancing life-saving treatments. “Many illnesses, including aids and breast cancer, kill far fewer Americans now than they did 30 years ago, due to medical advancements developed at our universities. Technological innovations made in engineering labs across the country have grown our economy year after year.” 
Jeff Wickersham, a professor of medicine who’s been at Yale for 15 years working on HIV treatment and prevention, told the crowd on the Cross Campus quad that in March of this year he’d received his first ever NIH grant termination notice. 
“There is a chokehold on funding right now,” Wickersham said. “Only 50% of the funds that should have been awarded so far this year have been awarded, and we are here today to say: No. Stop this.”

Cuts to medical research also resonated at UConn, where Blagojevic said he feared what it could mean for people like him. As a cancer survivor, he said, “every single drug in my chemo regimen was developed in full or in part by NIH research.”
“So thank God that Republicans didn’t cut NIH 20 years ago because I would be dead right now,” Blagojevic said. “We’re not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet. We’re not just talking about numbers on a budget report. These are human lives. These are our futures.”
Adam McCready, who works within UConn’s Neag School of Education, said his department is also facing cuts. His team had been working on research regarding the connection between student technology and digital literacy, school intervention and the impact on academic outcomes for middle schoolers, but the work was cut short abruptly and without notice, he said.
“Our work and some of our team members livelihoods are in jeopardy, all because it was deemed wasteful spending,” McCready said before leading a chant. 
“No research, no knowledge, no progress,” the crowd shouted.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Teachers are celebrating near-passage of a South Carolina bill advocates have been pushing for years as a major help in recruiting and retaining educators.
The bill, dubbed the “Educator Assistance Act,” received unanimous approval from senators Wednesday, marking the first time it’s gotten a vote in the chamber.
The legislation will not only significantly improve teachers’ lives but send the message that legislators respect teachers as professionals, supporters said.
“This is a huge win,” said Patrick Kelly, a high school teacher who lobbies for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. “I cannot overstate how big of a win this will be for teachers’ working conditions.”
If the House, which again approved the legislation earlier this year, agrees to the Senate’s changes, the bill will head to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk.
Its main sponsor, Rep. Shannon Erickson — the Beaufort Republican who leads the House’s education committee — said she’s hopeful that’s what will happen.
The House passed a different version of the bill last session, and legislators have proposed parts of it to varying levels of success over the past several years. The Senate didn’t take up the bill last year mainly because of timing issues, not because senators didn’t support the idea, said Sen. Greg Hembree, chair of the Senate Education Committee.
“It’s good all-around for the teachers and the students,” said Hembree, R-Little River. “I’m glad we got it done.”
As teacher pay has risen in recent years, the number of teacher vacancies in the state has dropped, though it remains far above the number reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the state’s Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement. While pay is a major issue for teachers, hiring and keeping people in teaching jobs will require more than increasing minimum salaries, Kelly said.
In talking to teachers over the years, Kelly has heard three major complaints from teachers beyond compensation: more support, more planning time and more respect. Many districts have already implemented parts of the bill, but requiring it across the board will help teachers in districts without such policies, he said.
SC bill would require schools to excuse some extracurricular absences

A major piece of the bill is requiring school districts to include a teacher’s expected minimum salary in their contract. Because those contracts are due May 10, before legislators pass their final budget and school districts have decided how much to pay teachers, most educators sign on without knowing how much they’ll get paid.
“I can’t think of any other profession where signing a contract without knowing your salary would be acceptable,” Kelly said.
The bill would also not allow district officials to reassign a teacher to another school or subject during the school year with less than five school days of notice unless the superintendent can prove it’s for a good reason. That gives teachers peace of mind knowing they’ll be teaching the class for which they signed up, advocates have said.
Teachers would also get guaranteed planning time under the bill. Current law allows districts to give teachers up to two days of planning, but it’s not required, meaning many districts eat up that time with professional development meetings, advocates have said. The proposal would set aside two days free of meetings for teachers to plan.
That change may not seem like much, but it makes a world of difference for teachers preparing for a new year, Kelly said.
“That is critically important to making sure efficient instruction can happen on day one,” Kelly said.
When teachers do have to attend professional development trainings, the bill would allow them to count those hours toward the 120 continuing education credits they’re required to obtain every five years in order to renew their teaching certificates. Requiring both has created a process advocates have said is often redundant and time-consuming.
“To stop the merry-go-round of having to deal with your certification is a huge, huge step,” Erickson said.
The biggest change senators made to the bill would allow teachers to move to a different part of the state without breaking their contract.
Currently, teachers who move after signing their contract can lose their ability to teach for up to a year. That meant teachers who needed to move for personal reasons, such as a spouse taking a job in a different part of the state, had to choose between finding a way to stay or being unable to teach that school year, teachers’ advocates have said.
One part of the bill that stood out to Hembree would allow teachers to donate their unused sick days to other colleagues. When he was solicitor in Horry and Georgetown counties, his office used a similar program. When two of his employees were diagnosed with cancer, they found the extra sick days invaluable, he said.
“That’s not going to come up a lot, but boy, when it does, it can make a difference in someone’s life,” Hembree said.
Teachers’ advocates said the bill is a major step forward, but they want to see more in future years.
Changing policies means little without good leadership, Kelly said. He encouraged legislators to continue finding ways to recruit and train principals and superintendents who can support the teachers in their schools.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, said she’d like to see longer windows for teachers to break their contracts and move to a different district, since job openings are often not posted until after the signing deadline, she said.
“We like it,” East said of the bill. “It could’ve gone a little further, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/admin-ajax-2.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408
,DC,2025-04-17 20:54:31+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Supreme Court to hear case on Trump’s birthright citizenship order,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-hear-case-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court announced Thursday it will hear oral arguments next month over President Donald Trump’s efforts to restructure birthright citizenship, though the justices won’t decide on the merits of the case just yet. Instead, they will choose whether to leave in place nationwide injunctions from lower courts that so far have blocked the Trump administration from implementing the executive order.The oral arguments, scheduled for May 15, will likely provide the first indication of whether any of the nine justices are interested in revisiting the Court’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 following the Civil War.The amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”The Supreme Court ruled in 1898 in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that the 14th Amendment guarantees any child born in the United States is entitled to U.S. citizenship, even if their parents are not citizens.Trump disagrees with that ruling and signed an executive order on his first day in office seeking to change which babies born in the United States become citizens. If that order were implemented, babies whose parents were “unlawfully present in the United States” or whose parents’ presence “was lawful but temporary” would not be eligible for citizenship.Several organizations and Democratic attorneys general filed lawsuits seeking to block the executive order, leading to nationwide injunctions against its implementation.Last month, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the lower court’s nationwide injunctions, limiting them to the organizations and states that filed suit.The three cases are Trump v. State of Washington, Trump v. CASA, Inc. and Trump v. State of New Jersey.LegislationNationwide injunctions by lower court judges have become an issue for Republicans in Congress as well as the Trump administration.Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced a bill in Congress that would bar federal district court judges from being able to implement nationwide injunctions.“We all have to agree to give up the universal injunction as a weapon against policies we disagree with,” Grassley said during a hearing earlier this month. “The damage it causes to the judicial system and to our democracy is too great.”",,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408

The […],"Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Robert Spindell arrives at Milwaukee Central Count with Sen. Ron Johnson (Photo | Isiah Holmes)Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) Chair Ann Jacobs said at a meeting Thursday that the body is still investigating how the City of Madison lost nearly 200 ballots during the 2024 presidential election. 
The city of Madison announced in late December that 193 unprocessed absentee ballots had been found in the weeks following the election. The discovered ballots weren’t enough to sway the results of any contests, but WEC began an investigation into the error to determine what caused it and how similar mistakes can be prevented in future elections. 
On Thursday, Jacobs said that she and Republican commissioner Don Millis had already taken depositions of former Madison city clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl and members of her staff but that there was more work to be done and depositions to conduct with employees of Madison and Dane County. She added that those other interviews were delayed until after the April 1 election. 
Witzel-Behl, who had already been on administrative leave during the spring elections, resigned from her position as Madison city clerk earlier this week after nearly two decades in the role during which time she oversaw more than 60 elections. 
Jacobs said the investigation has already highlighted ways the state can improve its absentee ballot processes. 
“On a positive note, I do think the information we’re learning from the work we’ve done so far will help inform some best practices for tracking absentee ballots, making sure all absentee ballots are counted timely, and as we move to amend our manuals and update them … I really do think that what we’ve learned is going to help us do a better job there on some of that absentee ballot processing,” she said. 
After the update on the investigation, Republican commissioner Robert Spindell began remarks that devolved into a shouting match with Jacobs. 
Spindell began by noting how long Witzel-Behl had been the Madison clerk. 
“I think it’s fine that we’re doing this investigation of the city of Madison, or the misplacement of some [193] ballots and then not properly following through when they were found,” he said. “But I do want to commend the Madison clerk for her 20-plus years service.” 
Spindell then transitioned into what he said he believes is a “more serious problem” — some Milwaukee polling places running out of ballots during the April 1 election. On Election Day earlier this month, seven polling sites ran out of ballots, causing city officials to scramble to replenish supplies. The delay caused long lines to form at some polls. 
City election officials said they generally determine how many ballots to print and distribute to poll locations by assessing voter turnout in previous similar elections. But this year Wisconsin and Milwaukee broke turnout records for a spring election. 
A former member of the Milwaukee Elections Commission who previously sparked controversy when he celebrated and took credit for the low turnout among Black voters in the 2022 midterm elections, Spindell has often been extremely critical of the administration of Milwaukee’s elections. 
Republicans have often attacked Milwaukee’s election administration, resulting in frequent, baseless accusations that the city’s election results are fraudulent. 
Before Spindell could finish his statement, Jacobs banged her gavel, saying she was ruling his comment out of order, but Spindell just got louder and continued. 
Wisconsin open meetings law requires that if a government body such as the elections commission is going to discuss an issue at a meeting, it must have been properly listed on the meeting’s announced agenda. 
“I am not going to let you keep going,” Jacobs said. “I’m going to talk over you until you stop. You must stop. You are out of order, and I will eject you from this meeting. Do you understand the words I am saying? They are simple. You are out of order. The City of Milwaukee is not on this agenda. You do not get to hijack the agenda. You are not the chair. When you are chair you get to put things on the agenda, it’s not on the agenda.” 
Even though most of what he said was inaudible, Spindell ended by saying “I’ve said what I needed to say.” 
During the meeting, the commission also approved the design for a mailer that will be sent to voters who haven’t voted in four years to ask if they still live at the addresses listed in their voter registrations and informing them they risk having their registrations deactivated. The commissioners also  received an update on an audit to determine if any people currently serving felony sentences voted in recent elections and moved forward an administrative rule that would keep the home addresses of judicial candidates off public elections paperwork.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 ‘I can’t do anything for their brother’

The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky’s economy is the nation’s most reliant on global trade, according to a new study that looks at the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on housing prices.
The study found that imports into Kentucky equal 32.3% of the state’s gross domestic product, the highest of any state, while exports make up 16.3% of Kentucky GDP, behind only Louisiana and Texas. 
“With robust manufacturing logistics, the state has become a key player in facilitating the movement of goods across borders,” explains the report from the National Association of Realtors.  
Trump promises that his taxes on imports will move manufacturing jobs back to this country and raise revenue to pay for tax cuts. His approach has drawn the support of union president Shawn Fain of the United Auto Workers. Trump, who ran on a promise to impose tariffs, won 65% of Kentucky votes last year.
But both of Kentucky’s U.S. senators — Republicans Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul — have broken with the Republican president to oppose his new tariffs. The Kentucky Chamber of Commerce also is voicing opposition to Trump’s trade policy as the numbers suggest Kentucky could be a casualty in a brewing trade war. 
Predicting “unnecessary disruptions” to Kentucky’s  economy, the state Chamber says Trump’s plans could hurt auto manufacturers, distillers and farmers. China recently responded to Trump by increasing its tariff on U.S. soybeans from 60% to 115%. Soybeans are Kentucky’s third most valuable farm commodity, behind poultry and corn. China buys more than half of U.S. soybean exports.
Other states’ foreign trade accounts post bigger numbers, but trade is more significant to Kentucky because of its smaller economy.
Ranging from parts for manufacturing to consumer electronics, imports’ prominence in Kentucky “reflects the state’s deep integration into the global market — especially in pharmaceuticals and automotive industries. Its top import partners are Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan,” says the study by Nadia Evangelou, an economist with the Realtors trade group.
Exports are goods produced and sold to international buyers. “It might surprise some, but Kentucky exports a significant number of cars and aerospace parts. Major companies such as Toyota and GE Aviation operate there. The primary partners are Canada, the U.K., and France, with over $4.5 billion in exports to each country,” says the study 
States like Kentucky and Texas that rely on both imports and exports “are more likely to experience the ripple effects of global supply chain shifts, both positive and negative,” the study says. Indiana, Michigan, and South Carolina also rank high on both exports and imports. “A surge in global demand supports their growth, while disruptions, such as factory shutdowns overseas or sudden tariffs, can present challenges as well.” 
Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the state’s manufacturing base reflects both parts imports and product exports and that “strategic tariffs have a role to play as part of a broader industrial policy aimed at key industries, of which Kentucky has several including automobiles and aircraft.”
He also predicts bad outcomes from Trump’s approach. “These across-the-board and on-again, off-again tariffs throw the economy into chaos and uncertainty and cut off the opportunity for trade relationships that are mutually beneficial and that, with good policy, can create better jobs both here and abroad.”
Invoking an emergency law, Trump has imposed, and in some cases later modified, a variety of tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most imports, an extra 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 145% tariff on China. He also imposed — but then paused for 90 days — what he calls reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 trading partners. Trump has levied import fees on iron and steel and a 25% levy on imported car parts due to begin May 3. The Associated Press reports confusion over Trump administration exemptions from the new tariffs for some electronics. The uncertainty is roiling stock and bond values.
Over the last 30 years, the study says, economic growth has been less robust in states like Kentucky that are highly reliant on trade, both in terms of job creation and housing values, probably because of their dependence on manufacturing which has been in decline. 
The study says large states where exports are a small part of GDP like New York, Florida and California have economies driven more by services in finance, tourism and entertainment.
“The states that led in home price growth were often those with rapid job growth in tech and services, high levels of domestic migration, and limited housing supply or zoning constraints,” writes Evangelou.



Kentucky tied deeply to global supply chains

“Kentucky is an automotive manufacturing powerhouse, with four major assembly plants and hundreds of auto parts facilities driving $5 billion worth of auto-related exports annually,” says a story about the economic study on realtor.com.
“Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the state drives $3.8 billion worth of exports, while aerospace exports a total of $19 billion.
“Those industries tie Kentucky deeply into global supply chains and rely on imports of components and precursors, with annual imports to the state totaling $94 billion. 
“Kentucky’s most famous product, bourbon, is also responsible for $500 million in exports each year. The state’s top import partners are Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan, while its top export recipients are Canada, the U.K., and France.”

Dan McKee has submitted a budget amendment seeking to reduce bureaucratic hurdles hounding the Department of Housing's governance structure. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Under a budget amendment filed by Gov. Dan McKee on Wednesday, the Rhode Island Department of Housing would be renamed the Executive Office of Housing in a move designed to consolidate state housing governance.
Changes stem from a 141-page report that Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard submitted to state leaders at the end of 2024. The General Assembly as part of its fiscal year 2025 budget had asked the Department of Housing to review and recommend ways to streamline housing governance across Rhode Island as part of the state’s fiscal year 2025 budget.
“By introducing this budget amendment, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, we are taking a critical step toward creating a more efficient and unified housing governance structure,” McKee said in a statement. “This is about providing real, lasting solutions for Rhode Islanders, and I am committed to making them a reality.”
Under the plan, the state would merge the Housing Resources Commission and the Advisory Council to the 20-member Interagency Council on Homelessness into a single advisory body. 
The existing Housing Resources Commission consists of 18 members from the public and private sectors. The Interagency Council on Homelessness met for the first time in seven years last December with the intention to reform its advisory council once the budget amendment is approved, said Housing Department spokesperson Emily Marshall.
State law requires at least three members of the advisory council be involved with the homeless community.
McKee’s amendment would codify the Secretary of Housing as the permanent chair of the board of commissioners for RIHousing, the quasi-state agency that finances affordable home construction. 
New year, new potential name for R.I.’s housing department

The new Executive Office of Housing would also take over administration of the state’s Housing Production Fund. Created by the General Assembly in 2021, the fund is supported by real estate transfer tax revenue and has been managed by RIHousing.
Officials at RIHousing are still reviewing McKee’s budget amendment, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Christine Hunsinger told Rhode Island Current.
Such changes would help state agencies work better together to clear some of the regulatory redundancies stunting Rhode Island’s housing development, according to the announcement from the governor’s office.
“The state’s housing challenges require a unified and coordinated approach,” Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard said in a statement. “By implementing these structural changes, we can ensure that the state’s resources are being used effectively, and that we are making measurable progress in addressing the housing needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Housing officials want to have 15,000 total new homes permitted by 2030, but getting new homes built has been incremental at best.
The department’s latest integrated housing report released Tuesday found that between 2021 and 2024, Rhode Island added 4,365 new units — representing a 0.9% increase to its housing stock between those three years. The state permitted 2,655 new units for 2024, according to the report.
McKee’s office said the governor believes the department’s governance recommendations are what the state needs to produce long-term benefits for Rhode Island’s housing sector, along with reducing homelessness.
At least 2,442 unhoused people across Rhode Island were counted when volunteers from the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness conducted an annual survey in late January 2024 — up 35% from the 2023 count. ​The coalition conducted its annual Point-In-Time count for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Jan. 28, but results aren’t expected to be released until some time in the summer. 
Every three years starting around July 1, 2026, the department must create a statewide plan to address and end homelessness. 
But affordable housing advocates have concerns about the state’s ability to take on more responsibility — especially as uncertainty continues over federal funding toward housing projects. 
“Over 75% of the funding that we get for housing and homelessness programs comes from the federal government,” HousingWorks RI Director Brenda Clement, who serves on the Housing Resources Commission, said in an interview Thursday. “I don’t want to create something in state government that is not fundable.” 
Clement declined to comment on the state’s plan to create a single advisory body.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has not yet reviewed the governor’s amendment, chamber spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Thursday. The House Committee on Finance is expected to schedule a public hearing some time after lawmakers return from their April recess next week.
The State House this year is considering a dozen new proposals in a  package of bills aiming to encourage new home construction including legislation that would make it easier to subdivide oversized lots, allow vacant or unused state-owned land to be developed, and encourage municipalities to convert vacant commercial space into homes.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”

Federal regulator: Pharmacy middlemen appear to be raising prices, hurting patients

 

Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 The legal landscape

Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.

Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

 

This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.











This is not grassroots opposition to this bill. This is astroturf.


– Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, who supported HB 1150



“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.

 ‘Winners and losers’

Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”

GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Photo via Wells Police Facebook)After federal immigration authorities accepted Maine’s first police department into an official partnership earlier this month, some community members are now requesting police terminate the contract. 
The crux of the rift between the community and police: uncertainty and disagreement over how they expect the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program will operate in practice. 
Revived under President Donald Trump’s administration to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, those pushing back on Wells’ participation in the program argue it entangles their local police with a federal agency that has been accused of disregarding due process. 
Four community members asked the Wells Select Board on Tuesday night to direct the police department to dissolve the agreement, arguing the department should have first consulted the public and raising concern about the program’s history of abuse. Before Trump reinstated the program, it was discontinued in 2012 after the discovery of discriminatory practices, including racial profiling.
But Wells police leadership argue the agreement doesn’t mean their local agency will adopt ICE’s recent approach to arrests. Rather, Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam told Maine Morning Star she entered into the agreement to take advantage of a training opportunity and streamline work flow.
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

As first reported by Maine Morning Star, the Wells Police Department was the first — and so far only — agency in Maine to sign an agreement under the 287(g) program, which permits local officers to arrest people on immigration violations, an authority otherwise reserved for federal agents. 
Wells’ agreement is specifically for 287(g)’s “task force model,” which ICE describes as a “force multiplier” to allow law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties. 287(g)’s other two models are focused on investigating people who have already been arrested and booked in local jails. 
As of April 16, ICE had signed 456 Memorandums of Agreement for 287(g) programs covering 38 states, with task force agreements with 190 agencies in 23 states, including Wells. 
Putnam said ICE has informed her department that the training includes 40 hours of online courses, which the department had yet to begin as of this week. The department submitted to ICE a list of officers eligible to participate in the program, who must have two years of police experience and be a U.S. citizen, which Putnam said is the majority of the department.
Regarding when arrests for immigration violations could begin after that, “We don’t know,” Putnam said. “We haven’t been told when to start.” 
Residents raise concern about ‘larger’ enforcement picture
The memorandum of understanding ICE signed with Wells Police permits its officers once trained to interrogate any “person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States” and “arrest without warrant any alien entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view,” among other capabilities otherwise reserved for federal authorities. 
But Putnam said when Wells officers start enforcing immigration violations through the agreements, they will only act on existing federal warrants that have had judicial review. 
Normally, she said, when local police run a license and discover an existing federal warrant for an immigration offense, they have to wait for federal authorities to make an arrest. The agreement eliminates that redundancy, Putnam said.

“We’re not rounding up undocumented people,” said Wells Police Captain Kevin Chabot. “Wells Police does not do proactive immigration enforcement.” 
Putnam said regardless of what the partnership allows, “We’re doing what I’m telling you we’re going to do, and that’s it.”
Putnam has repeatedly told Maine Morning Star that she hopes Mainers have confidence in their local law enforcement officers who’ll be carrying out the work. But a lack of trust in local authorities is not why some are objecting to the ICE agreement. 
“It’s not a matter of not trusting the chief and her force,” Cheryl Dearman Mills, one of the people who spoke at the select board meeting, told Maine Morning Star. “As I read the [memorandum of understanding], it raises concerns about control and future entanglement with ICE.”
The memorandum also states that local police have the authority to serve and execute warrants of arrest for immigration violations, issue immigration detainers and prepare charging documents.
Others who called for the select board to terminate the ICE agreement similarly said their concern was with local police formalizing a relationship with an agency that appears, at times, to be acting outside of the law.
“Chief Putnam was looking at this contract primarily with a local focus, separate from the larger picture of ICE’s current tactics of enforcement and deportation,” Wells resident Mary Marra told the select board. “And I was seeing this agreement primarily from a broader focus and how ICE’s questionable and sometimes illegitimate enforcement reflects very poorly on our town.”
For example, Marra pointed to masked immigration officers detaining Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk for allegedly supporting Hamas by co-authoring an op-ed calling for the school to divest from companies with ties to Israel, as well as the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.
This week in Florida, a U.S.-born citizen was arrested for entering the state as an “unauthorized alien.” His mother and a community advocate showed his birth certificate during a hearing, but the judge said she had no authority to release him, as reported by Maine Morning Star’s sister outlet the Florida Phoenix. 
“This is Wells Police acting as ICE agents in certain situations and I am extremely uncomfortable with what ICE is doing,” said another Wells resident, Peg Duddy, who is calling for the termination of the ICE contract. 
Duddy and others have met on-on-one with Putnam, as well as attended meetings with the chief and her leadership team, including one hosted by the Wells Democratic Town Committee Wednesday night. 










They don’t want ICE in their town. This is one way of hopefully keeping them out of town.

“They don’t want ICE in their town,” Putnam said of attendees after the meeting. “This is one way of hopefully keeping them out of town.” 
Duddy and Dearman Mills told Maine Morning Star that the meeting did not change their opposition and that they will continue to push for the contract to be terminated. More immediately, they’re requesting at minimum a 90-day pause, which they said would afford time to clarify the work Wells Police will engage in through the agreement. 
“Also to evaluate where the national picture is in 90 days,” Duddy said, “because this is not in isolation from that.”
Chair of the Wells Select Board John MacLeod III did not respond to a request for comment about the community members’ requests.
Putnam said she’s having meetings with various groups — places of worship, the local Chamber of Commerce, businesses who employ immigrants on work visas — to answer questions about the ICE agreement but said she’s not reconsidering it in light of pushback from some community members. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, she said.
Immigration enforcement in Maine
Data posted on the ICE website listed the Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, with a pending application earlier this month but ICE has since removed the department from that list and also does not indicate an agreement has been signed. ICE, Monmouth Winthrop Police Chief Paul Ferland and Lieutenant Dana Wessling did not respond to requests for comment regarding whether the application was terminated and why. 
Such agreements could face legal hurdles as Democrats in the Maine Legislature proposed legislation to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The bill has yet to have a public hearing. 
Aside from 287(g) agreements, an uptick in immigration detentions have revealed increased federal operations in Maine. Cumberland County Jail in Portland had 122 people detained under ICE orders last month, according to data Maine Morning Star obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request. 
According to attorneys, while some of these people were arrested in the state, the majority appear to be transferred from other states and are quickly transferred out too, signaling that federal authorities are using Maine as a tool in its “mass deportation” goal.
“It’s crucial for Maine’s people to know how their public officials may be supporting federal immigration enforcement, which often violates people’s constitutional rights,” ACLU of Maine Staff Attorney Anahita Sotoohi said in a statement on Thursday, after the organization filed information requests seeking a more comprehensive picture of local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 
“Abuses of power and attacks on due process threaten all people, regardless of immigration status,” Sotoohi said. “When due process is undermined for some, all people are at risk as power is consolidated and our system of checks and balances is dismantled.”

(Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The South Carolina Supreme Court will not stop efforts to remove state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office.
“This matter is not yet ripe for the court’s consideration,” the justices wrote in a joint opinion Thursday, throwing out the treasurer’s lawsuit that sought to halt the so-called “removal on address” process.
That means senators can continue with proceedings as scheduled Monday, when they’ll weigh whether Loftis “willfully neglected his duties” for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error that went unreported for nearly a decade.
For more than a year, Loftis has maintained he did nothing wrong and compared the Senate-led investigation to a political “witch hunt.” Loftis said he’s prepared to make his case.
“We know this process will be more political theatrics than the formal trial one would expect to overturn a statewide election,” he said in a statement. “We stand ready to show the citizens of South Carolina that the State Treasurer’s Office has faithfully fulfilled our statutory duties to provide core financial management services to state government. I certainly hope that the senators will agree with us once all the information is shared.”
South Carolina’s accounting problems, which involved almost no actual money, stem from the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one.
During the process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go. The state’s financial officials never alerted the General Assembly to the issue.
A forensic accounting firm hired by the state ultimately found staff had made the entries in error and all but $200 million of the money was never real.
Facing his own “removal on address,” former Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom — the state’s chief accountant for 20 years — resigned in 2023 over a separate but related accounting blunder. And former State Auditor George Kennedy resigned in January.
But Loftis has refused to step down and re-affirmed to reporters that no matter what happens Monday, he will be running for re-election in 2026 even if he has to go deep into his own pockets to fund a campaign.
As an elected official, Loftis can’t be fired. But the Legislature can remove him using an obscure constitutional measure, which has a lower bar than impeachment and applies when an official commits willful neglect of duty rather than a serious crime.
Under the process, the governor must remove an executive officer from office if two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature vote to remove him.
While the Senate has invoked the procedure, it’s unclear what the House will do — if anything. Only Democrat Rep. Heather Bauer of Columbia has introduced legislation calling on the House to start impeachment proceedings.
“I don’t believe the Senate thinks they can actually get me out of office,” Loftis told the SC Daily Gazette. “They just want to make my life miserable so I leave.”
In his statement, Loftis also noted his court case “was not dismissed on the merits.” Rather, the justices, citing past case law, declined to declare the process unconstitutional because Loftis had yet to go through the removal proceedings.
The court dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning the treasurer could file again at a later date.

(Getty Images)Opponents are turning to legal challenges to try to block or delay major public transit expansions — even after voters approve them.
Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voted-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
No fare! Free bus rides raise questions of fairness, viability.

Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Following years of delays, federal and New Mexico officials say starting May 7 any adult wanting to catch a flight or enter certain federal buildings will need to show a driver’s license that meets stricter standards.
REAL IDs, marked with a gold star in the card’s top right corner, require proof of identity, age and residency to the state issuing the card. That often means using original documents such as a birth certificate, social security card and two proofs of address.

Passengers must present the actual physical card, or can use their digital REAL ID at some locations, including the Albuquerque Sunport and the Lea County Regional Airport.
The temporary paper ID issued from the state will not be accepted at the gates, J. Mark Heisey, the federal security director for the Transportation Security Administration, told Source NM Thursday.
If a driver’s license doesn’t meet the requirements, then people will need to use their passports, military-issued ID or other acceptable licenses to fly or enter federal buildings, he said.
The deadline for rolling out the requirements has been repeatedly pushed back since the federal law was first enacted in 2005 — but officials say this time, it’s real.
“The Secretary of Homeland Security is committed to enforcing this law that’s been in place since 2005,” Heisey said. “So, we’re finally at a tipping point.”
  Transportation Security Administration Federal Security Director J. Mark Heisey at the Albuquerque Sunport on April 17, 2025.
People who show up to the airport without a REAL ID driver’s license will face delays at TSA checkpoints, he said.
“Even if you don’t have plans to travel now, your plans can change, so prepare now, as far as what type of photo ID you’ll plan to bring to the airport,” Heisey said.
About 80% of the driver’s licenses issued in New Mexico are REAL IDs, said Stephanie Schardin Clarke, the Secretary of New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue, which oversees the state’s licensing. That means about 370,000 New Mexicans don’t have a REAL ID, and only have the standard driver’s license.
“Not all of them either want or are eligible or need a real ID,” Schardin Clarke said. “Some portion of those 20% might be planning to travel with a passport or other acceptable documentation; for example, some of them might not be eligible for reasons of documentation, and then some might just not plan to travel or enter a federal building.”
More about New Mexico Real IDs
Schardin Clarke said that New Mexico state offices and private Motor Vehicle Division offices are prepared for additional appointments for REAL IDs. All state offices now require an appointment, which can be made online or scheduled over the phone at 1-888-683-3466.
The state also has a frequently asked questions page for the documentation required to get a REAL ID for the first time.
Htet Wint, the director of the Motor Vehicle Division, said the state does require anyone with a name change — from marriage, divorce, adoption, etc. — to bring in additional documents.
“We need all the linking documents,” Wint said. “Like a marriage certificate, divorce decrees, court order, that ties them to that name.”
Physical cards take about two weeks to arrive in the mail. The mobile driver’s license downloaded to a digital wallet in a phone will take 24 hours to update.

Beau Ballard of Lincoln, center right, talks with Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler, Speaker John Arch of La Vista and State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Despite earlier statements that changes to annual school retirement contributions would not be used to balance Nebraska’s budget, lawmakers confirmed Thursday that the reductions will go toward that goal.
State senators gave 38-0 first-approval Thursday to Legislative Bill 645, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, to lower employer, employee and state contributions to the statewide school retirement plan based on its funding level compared to obligations to members. The plan is currently 99.91% funded.
The state retirement plan covers all eligible school employees, notably teachers, outside Omaha Public Schools, which has a separate retirement plan and is not as highly funded.
Currently, employees contribute to the group plan 9.78% of monthly payroll and school districts give 9.88% of the payroll paid to covered district employees. The state annually gives 2% of the statewide payroll for covered members. Payroll was about $2.5 billion in the past year.
‘Built-in protections’
Under Ballard’s bill, and an amendment adopted 41-0, contribution rates would change as follows:

Less than 96% funded — 9.75% employees, 9.85% employers, 2% state.
Between 96% funded and 98% funded — 8.75% employees, 8.84% employers, 0.7% state.
Between 98% and 100% funded — 8% employees, 8.08% employers, 0.7% state.
100% funded or more — 7.25% employees, 7.32% employers, 0% state.

“Importantly, these agreed-upon reductions in contributions have built-in protections to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fund,” said Ballard, chair of the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee.

The amended LB 645 could save the state at least $80 million in the next two fiscal years, which multiple senators celebrated as helping to close the state’s projected budget shortfall of $457 million for the next two years.
That is prior to ongoing work by the Appropriations Committee, which has whittled the deficit down to about $100 million with continued negotiations. The budget bills must be presented to the Legislature by the end of the month for debate.
Health of the retirement plan
Opponents of Ballard’s measure, chiefly State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, said “political games” should not be played with teacher retirements, especially with what she said is “incredible economic volatility and uncertainty” under President Donald Trump.
“Playing Russian roulette with their retirement is wrong,” Conrad said Thursday.
If annual contributions in any year are not enough to keep the plan adequately funded under state law, such as if investment returns come up short or stock market returns are too volatile, the state is on the hook for additional funding outside of annual contributions. That happened in the late 2000s, leading to the current funding contribution levels in 2013 negotiations.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Retirement Committee, described Ballard’s LB 645 as a “reasonable compromise.”
He said opponents blasting the bill as a “serious threat” to the plan is just “not true” and that employees would see no benefit reductions. Clements said it’s “the right thing to do at this time.”
“The plan is in good shape, and the state’s contribution would go back to a full amount if it’s below 96% [funded],” Clements said.

‘We’ve done something to ourselves’
State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Jana Hughes of Seward said the contribution rates should have been examined without regard to the state budget, even if there was a surplus.
“If this retirement fund is funded at 100%, we should all raise our hands and say, ‘Halleluja,’” Moser said. “Funding it beyond 100% just does not make sense.”
Throughout the 2025 session, LB 645 has faced significant changes since it was first introduced in January.
At that time, only the state government would have seen a lowered contribution rate. Then, prior to a March hearing on LB 645, Ballard offered an amendment to change employee contribution rates. Now, employers who opposed the bill would also see lowered contribution rates.
School advocates have said the freed-up funds could lead to possibly lower property taxes or increased teacher pay, and many school advocacy groups are now in favor of the bill.
Ballard shared data from the Nebraska State Education Association estimating that the average school teacher could receive $1,000 more in take-home pay when the retirement plan is more than 98% funded, under LB 645. If the plan is fully funded, the take-home pay could be $1,500 each year.
State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln, of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, and Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, on the Appropriations Committee, said the budget deficit is self-inflicted.
Dungan described it as an online meme where a young child puts a stick in the spike of his bicycle and flips over, asking, “Oh my God, who did this?”
“This kind of feels like we’ve done something to ourselves and now we are operating under this structure where we feel like our hands are tied and we have to do these things,” Dungan said.

A piece of the budget ‘puzzle’
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, a member of the Revenue and Retirement Committees, described the situation as paying a bill twice.
“You don’t overfund pensions. You don’t overpay bills,” Sorrentino said. But you do have to have the wherewithal to make up for that when and if it gets to a certain level of funding.”
Conrad blamed “unsustainable, inequitable, reckless tax cuts,” and Cavanaugh said the Appropriations Committee “not once” discussed using the freed-up state retirement contributions to invest in education, contrary to earlier statements from the governor’s staff that the funds would not be used toward balancing the budget.
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s policy research office, who made those commitments earlier this year, did not respond to a request for comment on what had changed. Ballard said he would like to balance the budget without raising taxes, such as by limiting spending.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a seven-year member of the Appropriations Committee, said that as of Wednesday the committee still had $100 million to find to balance the budget. 
He has often described the budget as a “giant puzzle,” stating Thursday that retirement contributions is one piece. If his colleagues chose not to adopt the retirement changes, Dorn said that would lead to cuts somewhere else.
“This is just one part of that puzzle,” Dorn said.

‘We shouldn’t rush’
The Retirement Committee will have a new hearing on an amendment to LB 645 next week that could expand retirement eligibility for employees hired after July 1, 2018. Currently, retirement eligibility is when age plus years of service meets or exceeds 85 years — “Rule of 85.” Workers hired before July 2018 can retire as early as age 55. Newer employees have to wait until at least age 60.
As a trade-off, the state would not provide any annual contributions to the retirement plan in the next two years, potentially saving nearly $20 million more, before contributions are set as now outlined in LB 645.
Tim Royers, president of the NSEA, said the organization was happy that LB 645 advanced, and is looking forward to next week’s hearing on correcting a “serious wrong.”
“We have a chance to make them whole, and that’s important,” he told the Nebraska Examiner.
Ballard said he’s unsure how the amendment would be received the Legislature before the hearing.
Conrad, the dean of the Legislature who competed against Ballard for chair of the Retirement Committee in January, losing 25-24 after a tied vote, said the amended LB 645 could very well be a “good deal” for school employees, but she urged caution.
“If indeed we can find a path forward, we shouldn’t rush,” Conrad said. “We shouldn’t rush with something this important.”

He […],"Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson speaks to reporters Thursday after being the lone Republican vote against a proposal to reinstate the abortion ban overturned by voters in November (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The top Republican in the Missouri House said Thursday that a proposed constitutional amendment to ban abortion approved by his GOP colleagues doesn’t go far enough to protect victims of sexual assault. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit was the lone Republican to vote against sending the bill to the Senate on Thursday. He didn’t express his concerns about the legislation while it was being debated for four hours on Tuesday or an hour on Thursday, instead saving his remarks for a press conference moments after the bill’s passage. 
The proposed amendment, if passed by the Senate and approved by voters, would repeal the reproductive rights amendment known as Amendment 3 but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
In pregnancy, a woman’s first missed period marks four weeks gestation. Patterson, a physician, noted people who are younger or lower income and people who are Black and Hispanic are statistically more likely to learn they are pregnant later into the first trimester. 
On top of that, once a survivor learns they’re pregnant, Patterson said, they are dealing with not only the trauma of that attack, but also the logistics of getting in to see a doctor.
“A debate that we should have — and I hope happens in the Senate — is 12 weeks long enough,” Patterson said during the press conference. “ … If you’re going to say it’s OK to (have an abortion) after you’ve been raped, now we’re talking time limits.” 
State Rep. Yolanda Young, a Democrat from Kansas City, said during House debate on Thursday that bringing forward such an amendment “desecrated the sanctity of the majority.” 
Democrats have accused their colleagues across the aisle of attempting to subvert the will of the people by bringing to a vote a new abortion ban less than six months after Missouri became the first state to overturn a ban by guaranteeing the procedure up until fetal viability.
Patterson, who before the November election suggested the legislature should respect the will of the voters, said Thursday that “taking something to the voters another time isn’t really subverting the will of the voters.” 
“It really is something that I think should be celebrated,” he said, “that we have this process to amend the constitution, going back to the people and letting them have their say.”
But House Democrats remain critical of Republicans’ approach, saying the ballot language — the summary of the amendment that appears on the ballot — is deceptive. 
No where does the language mention the amendment would ban elective abortions.
Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

If approved by the Senate, it will go to a statewide vote. House Majority Floor Leader Alex Riley, a Republican from Springfield, said in a press release Thursday that voters could see the amendment on their ballots in 2026. The statement did not mention the possibility of the governor calling a special election as soon as this year.
“This is not democracy in action,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City. “This is authoritarianism in action.” 
  Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, center, is surrounded by members the Democratic caucus Thursday at a news conference after the House passed a proposal to reinstate the abortion ban overturned by voters in November (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
As is already in place under Amendment 3, the legislation would protect women’s access to health care during miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and other medical emergencies. It would also outlaw gender-affirming care for minors, something that is already banned in Missouri.
House Democrats took to the floor for an hour Thursday to oppose the legislation, sharing stories of pregnancy and abortion. 
“What continues to stick out to me is how different and how nuanced each person’s story is because our bodies are complicated and the health care needed to address any number of the situations that we find ourselves in is complicated,” Aune said. “So why do you keep trying to legislate this vital health care out of existence with a one-size-fits-all policy?” 
Proposed abortion ban amendment gets initial approval of Missouri House

State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican who is carrying the legislation, said the amendment is necessary to protect women and children “by returning to safety standards.”
In addition to banning nearly all elective abortions, the amendment would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
“Voters in the past few years were given the choice between two extremes, choices with no middle ground,” Seitz said. “Zero abortions, or what we have now, a landscape that allows for unfettered access.”
Despite abortion becoming legal up to the fetal viability — generally considered to be near the end of the second trimester —  access remains precarious. Procedural abortions are currently only available in the first trimester at three Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri. 
Medication abortions remain inaccessible. 
While a number of House Republicans compromised by supporting the inclusion of exceptions for survivors, Democrats stood firmly opposed to any ban on the table.
“How many among us could have even an inkling of what it’s like to be trapped physically, financially, emotionally, in a body and a system that does not offer mercy, only mandates,” said state Rep. Kem Smith, a Democrat from Florissant, as she asked her colleagues to imagine themselves in the shoes of a woman in an underfunded, marginalized community who just turned over a positive pregnancy test. 
She was among several Black women in the House who spoke against the proposal, citing Black maternal mortality rates in Missouri. A 2023 report from the state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review found Black mothers were three times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than white mothers. 
“When we legislate health care decisions that only women can biologically face without guaranteeing the support systems that make parenting a viable option,” Smith said. “We’re not passing laws, we’re passing judgement.” 
The proposed amendment approved Thursday is similar to the Senate version approved by a committee earlier this year over objections from one Republican lawmaker who opposes any exception for rape or incest.

“But going forward right now, the circumstances, 80% of all the funds you’ve received, more than that, that you’ve dispensed, were used for political purposes, and I believe that will jeopardize your 501C3 status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator said.
Andrade’s warning came during a rancorous public comment portion of the meeting in which people on the chat broadcast Nazi symbols, racial slurs and  pornography. Unable to control the flow of images or sounds being shared, the foundation board agreed to recess. The board was scheduled to reconvene late Thursday.
The board posted a link on its website apologizing for the disruption and said the Department of Children and Families was “actively working with law enforcement on the incident.”
Following the abbreviated meeting, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried called on the Department of Justice to investigate. She also urged Jack Campbell, the state attorney for the Tallahassee area, who is a Democrat, to do the same.
“I do think that it’s appropriate for Jack Campbell to start looking into some of these actions,” Fried said in a virtual press conference with reporters, adding that she had not personally spoken to him about it.

I believe that will jeopardize your 501C3 status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


Hope Florida is an initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis to help steer people off public assistance programs using state agency staff. Hope Florida Foundation is a not-for-profit direct support organization for the Department of Children and Families, which helps to administer the Hope Florida program.
Hope Florida Foundation’s finances have come under scrutiny following a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times report that it paid $5 million apiece to two organizations that then contributed to Keep Florida Clean, a political committee that worked to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana.
The $10 million payment to the two groups mirrors the amount the Hope Florida Foundation received from health care giant Centene as part of a settlement regarding overpayment of Medicaid pharmacy benefits and services.

DeSantis: $10M payment to Hope Florida Foundation is a ‘cherry on top’

 
Gov. Ron DeSantis has cried foul, accusing the House of working with the liberal media to smear the first lady’s reputation as she potentially prepares for a gubernatorial run to replace her husband, who is being forced out of office due to term limits.
Leading the financial review in the House is Andrade, who has held two meetings over the last two weeks with high ranking Hope Florida officials and agency heads.
More Hope Florida resignations
Hope Florida Foundation president Joshua Hay kicked off Thursday’s meeting by announcing that Jake Farmer, a registered lobbyist for Walgreens Co., had resigned from the board of directors. 
Hay did not disclose when Farmer resigned and the Department of Children and Families didn’t immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for his resignation letter. Farmer did not return Florida Phoenix’s phone call asking about his resignation.
Hay announced that Wendy Nissan had been appointed to the board of directors.
The meeting was interrupted before the board could publicly discuss its IRS 990.
The form shows that two state-contracted Medicaid managed care plans that were vying for lucrative new contracts made contributions to the Hope Florida Foundation. The contracts are the largest of their kind for the state and, according to the House of Representatives, the managed care plans will be paid $143 billion over the next six years to provide health care to the state’s poor, elderly, and disabled who rely on Medicaid for their health care.
The tax form shows that the Hope Florida Foundation received contributions from Simply Healthcare Plans and Centene of $98,408 and $95,223, respectively.
The state Agency for Health Care Administration has announced plans to award new contracts in April and a second round of announcements in July. The decisions expanded statewide Simply Healthcare’s footprint in the Medicaid managed care marketplace. The new contracts contain a requirement for the plans to work with the Hope Florida program and report information about their members to Hope Florida.
The IRS 990 form doesn’t list the dates contributions were made, only the time frame.
Headline-grabbing week
The board meeting capped a week of headlines for the foundation, a direct service organization for the Department of Children and Families as well as the Hope Florida program.
Hope Florida executive director Erik Dellenback is stepping down from his post as well as his position as chair of the Florida Faith and Community Advisory Council. Dellenback’s resignation was submitted in March and takes effect in May.  
Dellenback, though, did not mention his resignation during a lengthy House budget committee meeting in which he testified along with Hay and Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch. The resignation was first reported following the meeting.
Hay was accompanied by his own attorney at the House meeting. During his sworn testimony, Hay acknowledged that the Hope Florida Foundation had made mistakes by not filing its required paperwork. He also testified that he’s been working with Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil on completing the paperwork.
Jazil, who frequently represents state agencies and advises Keep Florida Clean, was recommended to him by attorney Jeff Aaron, Hay told the House committee. Aaron is a Republican attorney who successfully defended the governor in the lawsuit filed by suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren.
“Jeff Aaron connected you with Mohammad Jazil, the attorney for Keep Florida Clean, to help Hope Florida’s foundation in complying with the paperwork, to retroactively justify this payment. Is that what I am hearing right now? Members, I am sorry, I am a little flabbergasted at this revelation,” Andrade said at the meeting.

Gretchen Whitmer signs an executive directive instructing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to analyze the ways federal cuts to Medicaid would impact Michigan. | Kyle DavidsonAs Republicans in Congress continue to eye cuts to critical programs like Medicaid in an effort to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, several Michigan Democrats joined Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Royal Oak Thursday, as she signed an executive directive instructing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to prepare a report detailing how Medicaid cuts would impact the state. 
Gathering at Corewell Health’s William Beaumont University Hospital, U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) warned that cutting funding to Medicaid could threaten access to care for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents, including children, seniors and people with disabilities. 
Dan Carey, the hospital’s president, noted that nearly 50% of all Michigan children and six out of 10 elderly adults rely on Medicaid for their health care. If these cuts pass, Carey questioned what would happen to those children, Michigan communities and the workers who care for those children. 
With the U.S. House’s budget resolution directing the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by at least $880 billion over 10 years, Dingell, who serves on the committee, said there is no way to meet that goal without drastic cuts to Medicaid. 
  At an April 17, 2025 press conference in Royal Oak, Mich., U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) warned that Republicans would not be able to move forward with proposed spending cuts without harming Medicaid. | Kyle Davidson
“Medicaid is already a lean program. With few options for how to fill the budget hole left by cuts to Medicaid funding, states will be forced to consider cuts to coverage and benefits, leaving more people uninsured and under insured,” Dingell said.
During a presentation to the Michigan Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Health and Human Services in March, DHHS officials noted Michigan Medicaid makes up 34% of the state’s total budget, with 70% of funding for the state’s Medicaid program coming from the federal government.
“Any cut will place an enormous financial burden on parents, older adults, people with disabilities and their families, and especially those who have already spent down their assets and resources to qualify for Medicaid,” Dingell said. “Americans would have to forgo much needed care entirely, or their family members would be forced to choose between covering their children’s expenses, saving for their own retirement, or even being able to help their loved one.”

However, there is some hope Dingell said, noting that several Republicans have publicly opposed cuts to Medicaid. 
Stevens reflected on Whitmer’s efforts serving as the state Senate minority leader, working to craft the Healthy Michigan program, a bipartisan expansion to Medicaid signed into law by then Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican. 
As Michigan hosts some of the lowest rates of uninsured individuals in the nation, it’s strange and upsetting that hosting the press conference was even necessary, Stevens said, noting that these concerns come five years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I think that we can recognize the seriousness of what this moment represents, that people deserve better, that they deserve stability and consistency and access to medical benefits,” Stevens said.

Tlaib emphasized that these cuts are not just numbers, and that every percentage cut was the life of a Michigan neighbor. 

She also pointed to the ongoing crisis in Black maternal health, with the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women being nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women. She further noted that more than 40% of births in the U.S. are paid for by Medicaid.

“Seventy-two million people across every corner of our country rely on Medicaid. I don’t think one congressional district in our nation is not impacted. For families and seniors and people with disabilities, Medicaid is the difference between survival and suffering,” Tlaib said.
Prior to signing her directive, Whitmer said Medicaid has allowed breast cancer survivors to receive their annual mammogram and ensured more families can receive regular dental care, visit a primary care physician, and ensure their child receives emergency care rather than keeping them home due to concerns about the hospital bill.
“In short, Medicaid saves lives, it lowers costs and ensures that we have a health system that can meet all of our needs, no matter where we get our health care from,” she said.

Cuts to Medicaid would also hit small towns and rural communities hard, Whitmer said, with 37% of Michiganders in these areas receiving Medicaid coverage. 
The harm would also extend beyond individuals receiving Medicaid coverage Whitmer said, with Michigan hospitals set to lose out on half a billion in Medicaid funding annually.
“The equation is simple, fewer jobs equal weaker economies and a less healthy Michigan. Hospitals in local and rural communities across Michigan will close, which threatens care for everyone, raises prices for everyone. It forces people to drive further for health care, even in emergency situations,” Whitmer said.
“Everyone agrees that there’s always more that can be found in terms of rooting out waste or fraud. But this is not about that. This is massive, devastating slashes to core government service. This won’t make government more efficient, it’ll just raise your costs, eliminate local jobs and put lives in danger,” Whitmer said. 
By examining the impact of Medicaid cuts on the state, Michiganders can see the cost of what Republicans are hoping to accomplish in Washington, Whitmer said. 
“We’re going to send a clear message to anyone trying to trade your health and someone else’s tax cut. Medicaid is not for sale. I’ll keep fighting over the cost of health care and support access to our critical programs like Medicaid, because if you’re sick in Michigan, it shouldn’t mean going broke,” Whitmer said before signing the directive.
“Let’s all double down on our efforts to make sure that Congress and our Republican legislators in particular hear us loud and clear. This is an important moment. We can’t not fight for the people of Michigan and that’s what this is all about,” Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0752-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The seats are installed, the naming rights awarded and the first match to be hosted in Pawtucket’s new riverfront soccer stadium is less than one month away.
But the financial future of the newly christened Centreville Bank Stadium rests on more than a fan following; accompanying residential and commercial development is considered crucial to ensuring taxpayers get a return on government-issued bonds helping pay for the sports venue.
On Thursday, Fortuitous Partners unveiled the first details of the necessary and long-awaited housing and commercial development that will flank the stadium on either side of the Pawtucket River.
The plans, via partnerships with two “prominent” real estate developers, will bring more than 600 new housing units to the area along with commercial space, creating a kind of mini city encircling the new home for the Rhode Island FC team. 
“We are incredibly proud to see this vision for the riverfront and Tidewater Landing continue to come to life,” Dan Kroeber, managing partner at Fortuitous Partners, said in a statement. “This next phase of the development will not only support the new Centreville Bank Stadium, but also create a vibrant, connected community where residents, visitors, and fans can live, work, and enjoy everything Pawtucket’s riverfront has to offer.”
Revitalizing the vacant land mixed-use development was the original vision of private developers and state and city officials when they awarded a competitive bid to Fortuitous in 2019. What is now being proposed represents a substantial departure from the original timeline and cost.

At what price?
The price tag of the residential and commercial development was not available, with Fortuitous spokesperson Lala Ismailova citing “commercially sensitive financial information” in response to questions Thursday.
“We can confirm that we’re working closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure the project is financially sound, responsibly managed, and positioned to deliver long-term value,” Ismailova said in an email. wrote  This next phase represents a major investment in Rhode Island’s future, bringing much-needed housing, improved public amenities, and supporting the broader vision for a vibrant riverfront district.
The 10,500-seat stadium has already come in substantially over budget and past the deadline, with blame placed on inflation and supply chain disruptions. 
Rhode Island Commerce’s board of directors reluctantly agreed to shift all of the state bonds meant to fund public parking and infrastructure improvements to the stadium itself, with Gov. Dan McKee casting the tiebreaking vote in July 2022. 
“We really got suckered,” Mike McNally, a former Commerce board member who voted against the reallocation of state bonds for the project, said in an interview Thursday. “It’s like buying land and building the swimming pool but not the house.”
Borrowing costs subsequently soared. The $132 million borrowing issued in February 2024 is more than double the $59 estimate two years prior, with $89 million in interest accounting for the bulk of the costs over the 30-year repayment period. The cost features just $36 million in public tax-increment financing bonds, which assume revenue generated from the project to pay off the debt.
Revenue from the stadium alone is unlikely to generate the money needed. A 2023 financial analysis from a Commerce consultant, based on lower total borrowing costs, identified a $52 million shortfall in revenue generated from the stadium over the life of the bonds. It noted the need for additional commercial and residential development to help the city and state break even on borrowing costs.
No additional analysis based on final borrowing costs is in the works, Matt Touchette, a Commerce spokesperson, said in an interview Thursday. The state and city will start making payments on the debt service in fiscal 2027.
The city of Pawtucket has also chipped in $10 million from its unspent pandemic aid for the project, while the state awarded $10 million in tax credits, all for the stadium.

Asking for more
Despite his misgivings over how public money was used in the project, McNally welcomed the news that the stadium developer was following through on its commitment to build housing.
“That’s really what we wanted all along,” McNally said. “As long as they don’t ask for more public investment, I will be happy with that.”
As of Thursday, Fortuitous has not approached House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi seeking more financial help from the state for the housing and commercial components, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, confirmed via email.
Pawtucket city leaders have also not discussed financing details for the housing components with Fortuitous.
“Too early in the development process,” Christopher Hunter, a city spokesperson, said in an email. 
McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday.
But Kroeber told the Providence Journal that the company is hoping for public investment on the forthcoming infrastructure upgrades, which include a riverfront connecting both banks of the river, and pedestrian walkways. He did not specify a dollar figure. 
The next phase of development begins with construction of 300 market-rate housing units on the east side of the river, directly across from the new stadium. On the west side, fronting a new stadium plaza and riverfront, will be another 250 housing units and commercial space.
Boston-based real estate development and construction company Wood Partners will lead creation of both buildings. 
Farther north, on the east side of the river, a third set of 72 mixed-income housing units will be built by a separate developer, Philadelphia-based Pennrose. Federal and state tax credits offered for low-income housing will help to pay for this component of the project, which is under review by Rhode Island Housing. The city-owned land on School Street sits directly across from the Pawtucket Portuguese Social Club. Specific income limits for the affordable and workforce housing units have not been determined.
The housing and commercial development plans are now in the design and permitting phase, Ismailova said. She did not answer when asked for an expected completion date.   
Rhode Island FC will play its first match on home turf at 4 p.m. May 3, squaring off against San Antonio FC in an already sold-out game at Centreville Bank Stadium.

She had signaled she was considering a campaign for the seat left open by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s announcement that she would retire at the end of her term. Goodlander told the TV station she was “proud to support” Chris Pappas, the fourth-term 1st District representative, in the race. Pappas made his run official earlier this month.
“I feel humbled and grateful to so many people across our state who have encouraged me to take a look at the United States Senate,” Goodlander told WMUR, “and after a lot of thought and conversations with people I love and people I respect, and people who I had never met before, who I work for in this role right now, I’ve decided that I’m running for re-election in the House of Representatives.”
Granite Staters won’t pick Shaheen’s replacement until November 2026, leaving months for the field to take shape. Chris Sununu, the former Republican governor who left office earlier this year, ended speculation over his candidacy recently when he told the Pulse of New Hampshire he would not run for the seat.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature rejected a bill this week that would bring back limits on syringe services, following the recommendation of state public health experts and medical professionals.
LD 219, introduced by Rep. Anne-Marie Mastraccio (D-Sanford), would have limited the number of clean syringes that certified needle exchange programs can hand out, reverting to a one-for-one ratio that Maine required until 2022, when it adopted rules that allow participants to bring in just one used syringe to receive 100 clean ones. 
The bill sparked lengthy debate in both chambers, particularly in the light of an HIV outbreak in Penobscot County that has primarily impacted the unhoused community that uses injectable drugs. 
Several lawmakers highlighted the issue of syringe litter on roads, parks and on private property, which they blamed on the higher number of syringes people can access. 
But ultimately, the majority of legislators supported the Health and Human Services Committee’s recommendation to reject the bill, citing best practices supported by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and other public health and harm reduction organizations.
The Senate voted 22-21 against the bill Thursday following a 76-69 House vote earlier this week.
Republican Sen. Marianne Moore, who represents Washington County and sits on the Health Committee, expressed concern about the outbreak spreading to other counties, including her district. 
Needle exchanges face municipal pushback despite state, public health backing

“Limiting access to sterile syringes now will only make it harder to prevent, protect and control spread of disease in a county already under resourced and overburdened,” she said.
“We all want cleaner streets, safer communities and less syringe litter,” she said, but if we are serious about addressing syringe waste, she encouraged her peers to increase funding for disposal kiosks and biohazard containers. “Let’s stay the course of evidence-based policy,” Moore added.
Other Republican senators disagreed. Sen. Matt Harrington of York County and Sen. Scott Cyrway of Kennebec County raised concerns about drug overdoses and “decriminalizing drug culture.” 
“This idea that these centers are somehow reducing harm to me, is ridiculous,” Harrington said, referring to certified Syringe Service Programs. “This continuous nature of enabling this behavior… is just proven to be exacerbating this issue.”
Earlier this week, several Republican representatives also criticized the bill, saying they supported the limits the bill aimed to reimpose. 
“All Mainers and their pets are at risk of a dirty needle stick,” said Rep. Ann Fredericks of Sanford.
Sanford became one of the few municipalities to bring back limits in an emergency municipal ordinance last year, which bill sponsor Mastraccio said during her testimony helped reduce syringe litter.
But according to the Maine CDC’s syringe service report from 2023, released last May, most users bring in roughly the same amount of syringes they receive. Syringe services handed out 1.16 syringes for each one they collected last year, which means that despite some concern about the state’s 100 to 1 ratio, meaning the additional needles from these programs are not driving street litter. 
Syringe service programs also provide sharps disposal containers and help reduce discarded waste in communities, according to Dr. Kinna Thakarar, a physician at Maine Medical Center and an associate professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine. 
Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) said a rigid one-toone model doesn’t match the reality of substance use and doesn’t work.
“We have seen it in rural cities and towns alike. Public health policy must be grounded in science and best practices and lived realities of our communities,” she said. “This bill is out of step with all three.”

Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) speaks on the Senate floor in support of the ""Momnibus"" package of bills on April 17, 2025. | ScreenshotA 10-bill package to reduce racial inequities in maternal mortality in Michigan passed through the Michigan Senate Thursday, with supporters hoping that the second time will be the charm to getting the so-called “momnibus” signed into law.
The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, had received a similar reception when it was originally introduced in April 2024, but then failed to make it across the finish line after Republican lawmakers boycotted the lame duck session in December in protest to minimum and tipped wage reforms not being placed for a vote.
The main sponsor of the package is Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), who said the legislation incorporates a variety of approaches to improve prenatal and perinatal health outcomes in Michigan.
“By dismantling systemic barriers that disproportionately impact Black and brown birthing people, the Michigan Momnibus brings us one step closer to achieving equity and justice and reproductive and obstetric care,” Geiss told her colleagues prior to the vote. “It is a multifaceted bill package that works to improve integrity and accountability in Michigan’s maternal health care system, ensuring that every family has an equitable opportunity to have a healthy, joyful pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum experience that truly centers their needs.”



The Momnibus legislative package includes;
Senate Bill 29 mandates the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to compile annual data on racial and ethnic disparities in health care, as well as review statewide maternal deaths in order to complete a report to the legislature starting in 2026 and then continuing every three years. The department would also have to come up with a statewide plan to reduce such ethnic and racial disparities in health care.
Senate Bill 30 would enact the “Biased and Unjust Care Reporting Act” which requires the state health department to take and analyze reports of unfair treatment by pregnant or postpartum individuals who say they received improper medical care that was not culturally informed or treatment that caused them harm. The department would have to create a reporting tool to accept such complaints while also maintaining the patients’ privacy.
Senate Bill 31 bars hospital leadership from discriminating against a patient on the basis of their pregnancy or lactating status and would require a health facility to stabilize a patient or resident going through labor before ceasing care for the patient upon the patient’s refusal or denial of care. The facility would have to author a policy on patient rights and adhere to the policy.
Senate Bill 32 requires insurance companies offering medical malpractice insurance policies to provide the Department of Insurance and Financial Services with a review of the policies related to perinatal care on an annual basis.
Senate Bill 33 clarifies that a patient’s pregnancy would not preclude a designated patient advocate from making life-sustaining treatment decisions for the patient.
Senate Bill 34 clarifies Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, including pregnancy and lactation status. 
Senate Bill 36 amends the public health code to include eligible midwives who attended midwifery programs to participate in the state health department’s Michigan Essential Health Provider Repayment program.
Senate Bill 37 requires insurance companies that cover gynecological and pregnancy services to cover such services whether they be in a hospital or a patient’s home, by a qualified physician or nurse midwife or midwife.
Senate Bill 38 and Senate Bill 39 amends the Social Welfare Act to require the Healthy Michigan Plan to cover ultrasound procedures and fetal nonstress tests in offsite locations and permit Medicaid eligible individuals to be able to receive perinatal and gynecologic care under the Healthy Michigan Plan under certain circumstances.
 



Statistics have long corroborated disparities in maternal outcomes for women of color, with maternal mortality rates for Black women in the U.S. nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, the CDC says the rate of preterm birth among Black women is 12.34%, or about 1.5 times higher than the rate of preterm birth among white or Hispanic women, which stands at 7.64% and 8.72% respectively.
A lack of access to quality health care and educational resources are some of the reasons for the inequity, and are among the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. Known as the social determinants of health, the CDC says those factors include the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, worship, and age.
“Social determinants of health prevent many people from racial and ethnic minority groups from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional health,” said the CDC.
Geiss noted that the passage of the bills through the Senate came on the final day of Black Maternal Health Week.
“This has been a long road for the Michigan Momnibus, but by keeping the Momnibus moving, we can affirm a commitment to ensuring that healthy pregnancies and equitable care must transcend partisan racial, class, and economic divides, as every family deserves access to the care they need to thrive,” said Geiss.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)A bill moving through the state Legislature to establish tax breaks for energy-hogging data centers could pose serious risks to Colorado’s climate goals, utility rates and state budget, environmental groups say.
Senate Bill 25-280 was given initial approval by the Senate Transportation and Energy Committee on a 6-3 vote, after a lengthy hearing on Wednesday. Democrats, who hold commanding majorities at the statehouse, were split on the bill, with three joining the committee’s Republicans in favor, and three opposed.
Sponsored by state Sens. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, and Paul Lundeen, a Colorado Springs Republican, the measure would create a “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Program” in the state’s economic development office. Beginning in 2026, it would offer sales and income tax credits to incentivize investments in data centers and upgrades to electric transmission infrastructure. A nonpartisan fiscal analysis estimates the tax breaks would initially cost the state about $17 million a year.

Hinrichsen pitched data centers — sprawling server farms that power artificial intelligence models, cloud computing services and other technology — as an economic lifeline for communities like Pueblo, which faces a looming drop-off in tax revenue because of the early closure of Xcel Energy’s coal-fired Comanche Generating Station. To help the state meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets, Comanche’s final remaining 750-megawatt generating unit is now scheduled to be closed 40 years ahead of schedule in 2031, with a local tax revenue loss estimated at $25 million a year.
“We’re heading towards this cliff, and we have some significant challenges, but with data centers, we have a really, really unique opportunity,” Hinrichsen said. “We have a prime geographic location. We have the energy capacity and development capabilities to support a data center.”
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

But a nationwide boom in data center construction, largely driven by investment in AI, has stoked concerns about the electricity- and water-intensive facilities’ impact on the environment, and what the surging demand for energy could do to utility rates paid by consumers. Data centers made up about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity demand in 2023, and that figure could rise to 12% by 2028, the Department of Energy estimated last year. In addition to large amounts of electricity, operators use millions of gallons of water a year to cool their equipment.
Megan Kemp, a policy advocate with environmental group EarthJustice, called SB-280 “rushed legislation” that doesn’t balance generous incentives for data center operators with protections for Colorado communities.
“(The bill) fails to provide critical safeguards for utility customers, neglects to consider impacts on communities and undermines our progress toward meeting critical climate goals,” Kemp told lawmakers.
Budget and climate impacts
The bill’s sponsors and its critics disagreed sharply during Wednesday’s hearing on the outlook for the data center industry in Colorado in the absence of new incentives.
Hinrichsen said that while he was reluctant to pass legislation that would reduce state tax revenues in the face of a serious budget crunch, he had been convinced by “hundreds of conversations over the summer and fall” that Colorado isn’t competing effectively with other states for data center investments.
“What I have heard talking to folks in my economic development community, folks at the chamber of commerce, and those in the data center development world, is, ‘It’s not going to happen in our current framework,’” he said. “This is an opportunity that we’re uniquely poised to capitalize on, that we will not capitalize on, and 100% of nothing is precisely nothing.”
But Justin Brant, utility program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a Boulder-based environmental group, pointed to requests for over two gigawatts of new electricity load received by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility.
“Data centers are coming to our state no matter what,” Brant said.
Climate advocates are especially concerned that surging data center demand could lead electricity providers to prolong the use of fossil-fuel-powered generating assets, a trend already seen in the southeastern U.S., where utilities are expanding natural gas infrastructure to meet the anticipated demand increase.
Sara Axelrod, head of public affairs at Denver-based Crusoe Energy, told lawmakers of the “cocktail of energy solutions needed to power campuses like this.” Crusoe began in 2018 as a bitcoin mining operation powered by the waste methane from oil and gas extraction — excess natural gas that’s typically vented or flared by drillers — and now uses the same power source to power AI infrastructure.
“There is no perfect, one-size-fits-all energy solution when it comes to powering these data centers, particularly as we talk about AI and the increasing scale of these data centers,” Axelrod said.
Committee members adopted five amendments to the bill on Wednesday, including a major rewrite known as “strike below” amendment, which Hinrichsen said was intended to address concerns from labor groups.
But Brant said that while the amendment did “address some of our concerns, it raises a whole host of additional ones,” including questions about geographic preferences for data center sites and the applicability of the state’s renewable energy standard.
“This bill was written by the data centers with little or no stakeholder involvement,” he said. “We’d be happy to work with them and the sponsors in the interim to get something right, but this one doesn’t do it.”
“There’s so many big things that still need to be ironed out, that I’m really concerned,” said state Sen. Lisa Cutter, an Evergreen Democrat who voted against the bill. “I think you’re trying to address some of these things. But it just seems like there’s still a lot to be discussed.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislation to study the absorption of secessionist Illinois counties heads to Gov. Mike Braun after a successful concurrence vote Thursday, along with measures to examine “noncompliant” prosecutors and expand local funding options for transportation infrastructure.
“I think it’s been a great opportunity to talk about all the great things going on in Indiana, and to say … we’d love to have that conversation,” Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, told reporters.
  Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston answers reporter questions on Thursday, April 17, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
His House Enrolled Act 1008 would create an Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission tasked with exploring the absorption of Prairie State counties that have already voted to secede. Since 2020, 33 counties have passed such “advisory referenda,” with seven of those votes occurring in the most recent general election.
Originally, Illinois would’ve had to appoint members for the commission to convene. Now, it must meet by September — with or without Prairie State representation.
“That’s their choice whether they want to participate or not,” Huston said, shortly after the 64-23 concurrence vote.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne criticized the measure as a “publicity ploy,” and argued the secessionist counties would sink Indiana finances instead of contributing revenue.
Local prosecutors, roads
A proposal punishing public prosecutors who “categorically refuse to prosecute” criminal laws also crossed the finish line Thursday, on a 60-20 concurrence vote in the House.
House Enrolled Act 1006 initially would’ve also boosted the number of qualified special prosecutors available for appointment and offered partial reimbursement for prosecutors, defenders and more.

But those came with price tags, so the Senate stripped them out.
Now, it mainly creates a prosecutor review board that will scrutinize prosecutors and issue reports to the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council on those labeled “noncompliant.” But it no longer requires that funding be withheld.
And a complex transportation funding measure avoided negotiations — contrary to Senate expectations — when it earned a 69-19 concurrence vote in the House.
House Bill 1461 would change up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program, raise the speed limit on Interstate 465, let communities tap into excess township funds and ease barriers to tolling, among numerous other provisions.
Opponents largely cited the tolling provisions as problematic, complaining about the impact to residents and local streets.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  The Iowa Senate amended an open meetings and records bill Thursday to list security camera footage from the Iowa Capitol building as “confidential records.”
House File 706 is this year’s attempt to implement higher penalties and training requirements for Iowa’s open meetings and records laws. Fines for violating open meetings laws would increase to between $500 and $2,500 from the current range of between $100 and $500.
Knowing violations of these laws would rise to between $5,000 and $12,500; the current fine is between $1,000 and $2,500. The bill also would require that a member of a government body be removed from office if they engaged in a prior violation of open meetings laws. Additionally, newly elected and appointed public officials would have to complete a training on open records laws when they take office.
The bill passed the House unanimously in March. The measure is largely a response to alleged violations of open records laws by the city of Davenport following a six-story apartment building collapse in 2023 and alleged open meetings law violations regarding the city of Davenport reaching settlement agreements with three city employees without the city council’s approval in a public meeting.
Lawmakers also approved similar legislation in 2024, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds over language added as a Senate amendment introduced by Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, that changed the definition of a “meeting” of a government body.
Though this language is not present in the 2025 bill, Webster introduced an amendment Thursday that would add two types of information to the list of approved confidential records in Iowa Code — information obtained from security cameras operated by the legislative branch on property owned or leased by the state, and information “obtained from state employee identification card access systems” for buildings and rooms owned or leased by the state — specifically referring to the Iowa State Capitol.
Webster said this language, approved as an amendment in a 32-15 vote, would prevent people from using open records requests to find “blind spots” in Capitol security and prevent stalking or harassment of elected officials and government employees.
“If people wanted to cause this harm to the Capital building — to the people’s building — wanted to find out and go through all the camera footage to figure out where the blind spots might be in this Capitol, they could do it through an open records (request),” Webster said. “We’re eliminating that availability right now, which makes everybody in this building safer.”
Legislative staff said they are not aware of security camera footage being used to stalk or harass any lawmakers at the Statehouse.
Webster said an agreement was reached with groups like the Freedom of Information Council, the Iowa Newspaper Association and House lawmakers removing restrictions on the Iowa Department of Public Safety footage in an earlier version of the amendment, to ensure access to body camera footage would not be impacted.
But Democrats said the measure would prevent Iowans from accessing public information. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said that Iowans, as taxpayers, are paying for lawmakers’ and public workers’ time at the Iowa State Capitol, and should be able to access footage as requested.
“They’re paying the bill to run the camera,” Petersen said. “They’re paying the bill for this beautiful building. Why would we take public access away from them — in an open meetings bill no less? You want to take away public access and say it’s because of security — no it’s not.”
Webster said security camera footage could still be accessed through subpoenas — court orders to provide information or records — in cases where a person commits a crime in the Capitol building.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said the potential use of subpoenas to access these records was an “excuse” to obscure the limit being put on public access to what happens at the Capitol.
“The average citizen doesn’t have access to getting a subpoena, and shouldn’t need that access in that manner,” Quirmbach said. “The bill, as it has been amended, restricts the public access. It is not something that this Legislature should endorse.”

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Federal education dollars are now at risk thanks to President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education, which could significantly hurt Minnesota public school districts — the majority of which receive at least 10% of their budgets from the feds, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
Tribal nations within Minnesota’s borders would be even more impacted, as a larger share of their budgets comes from the feds. The Red Lake Public School District received nearly 40% of its revenue from federal funding in fiscal year 2022, according to EPI.
The Trump administration promised that closing the department won’t result in cutting federal funds, but the people who are responsible for determining whether schools qualify for a grant could soon be let go, risking the reliability of the funds.
Republicans in Congress are also desperate to find cuts to pay for more border defense, Pentagon spending and tax cuts and proposed significant cuts to federal education spending as recently as 2023. 
School districts receive the majority of their funding from the state and local governments, but the federal government plays a large role in assisting K-12 schools in low-income communities through Title 1 funding. The EPI study found that in most cases, federal funds make up less than 20% of a district’s budget. But, many districts rely far more heavily on the federal government, particularly in southern states, where some districts receive 70% of their revenue from the feds.

Many northern Minnesota school districts in and around tribal nations receive significant federal funds, as they are low-income areas. Cass Lake-Bena Public Schools, Mahnomen Public School District and Waubun-Ogema-White Earth Schools received about 30% of their district revenue from the feds in fiscal year 2022, according to the EPI analysis.
St. Paul Public School District received $176 million from the federal government in the same year, which accounts for 21% of its total revenue. Minneapolis Public Schools received $145 million, about 19% of its total revenue.
School districts across Minnesota and in the Twin Cities metro are facing severe budget shortfalls and have drawn down reserves to fill the gaps. The end of one-time pandemic aid, inflation and declining enrollment are major contributors to school districts’ tight budgets.
A cut to federal funding, even those schools that receive about 10% of federal funds, would require districts to lay off teachers and staff and make other difficult budget decisions. Or, they will go to voters in their districts and ask them to approve a property tax hike.
In addition to Title 1, the feds provide money for the IDEA program for special education students.
The Trump administration has threatened to withhold billions of these federal dollars to states that don’t capitulate to its demand that they end the use of diversity programs in public schools. 
Title 1 funds have been withheld from school districts at least once in recent history — to incentivize districts to desegregate.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-05-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 16:12:10.677330

Stothert, seeking a modern-record fourth term, spent most of the Omaha Press Club and League of Women Voters debate touting the city’s performance in her nearly dozen years as mayor. The debate was moderated by WOWT anchor Brian Mastre.
Parks and urban core
She said the city, with help from private donors and developers, is purposefully rebuilding the urban core’s parks and public spaces to make the city more interesting and appealing.

“We need steady leadership,” she said. “We need initiative. We need commitment to continue this great momentum. We have to build a stronger city for tomorrow.”
Both candidates agreed that Omaha has grown as a destination for young professionals but disagreed over whether City Hall has been a help or a hindrance in that progress.
Ewing said the local private donors and developers he speaks with say they are working around a lack of trust with the city to build and maintain new parks and event facilities.
“We have that new park for a reason, and that is because the city neglected the former Gene Leahy Mall and did not take care of that facility properly,” Ewing said.
Stothert disagreed, saying no donors would invest millions of dollars in downtown Omaha without trusting the leadership of the city. She said business leaders like the track the city is on.
“What my opponent just said is absolutely false,” Stothert said. “It’s not a lack of trust that the private sector and the philanthropists would put in $400 million for a park.”
Public safety and streetcar
Ewing, a former deputy chief at the Omaha Police Department, said his former co-workers were performing well despite being short more than 100 people. He said he would help them recruit.
“I have the skill set to help them be able to recruit police officers and get to full staffing so that they can really focus on community policing and building relationships,” he said.

Stothert said Ewing and critics of the pace of police hiring don’t understand the negative impact that protests after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis had on interest in police careers.
She dismissed Ewing’s criticism of the city’s public safety approach, pointing to crime stats she said show improvement. She credited police for working with community leaders.
“We will always be 5% higher [in pay] than any law enforcement agency in the state of Nebraska, and I feel like that will stop this cycle of everybody trying to catch up,” she said.
The two candidates largely agreed on the best path forward for the streetcar, saying they would like to eventually see plans that expand the route north and south to more of the city.
Ewing took a jab at Stothert for not letting the people vote on the project but has said the project is too far along to stop. He said Omaha needed to maximize development along the route.
“We have to ensure that it’s going to be the best possible use of our resources in this community as possible,” he said.
Stothert defended not going to a vote because the project did not raise taxes on Omaha residents and instead relies on a state-created incentive known as tax-increment financing.
She said it would spur more than $4 billion in private investment along the route from midtown Omaha’s University of Nebraska Medical Center to Mutual of Omaha’s downtown campus.
“It is a catalyst for economic development,” she said.
Traffic cameras, immigration and DEI
Both candidates also agreed on the positive impact of diversity and immigration on Omaha. Stothert and Ewing defended the city having a diversity, equity and inclusion officer.

One brief but interesting disagreement: traffic cameras. Ewing said he supported them for traffic infraction enforcement, while Stothert questioned their reliability and effectiveness.
Stothert won the five-way April primary with 27,245 votes. Ewing finished second with 24,605. The remaining candidates, including former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, earned 23,358 votes.
She said she would continue to focus her message on the priorities she said the people have prioritized: public safety, lower taxes and economic development.
“We work really, really hard, and we don’t take anything for granted,” she said, adding that she earned a higher percentage of the primary vote than she had in her first race.
Ewing said he saw something different in the numbers from April: voter fatigue with the mayor. Repeating his stump speech, he said the people of Omaha are ready for a change.
“What I learned from the primary is that 65% of the voters wanted a new mayor,” Ewing said. He later added: “The most important thing an elected leader can do is be responsive.”
Said Stothert: “Cities never stand still. They are either moving forward and growing or they are declining and falling behind. I want to keep Omaha moving forward.”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1 year old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

Josh Shapiro’s official residence early Sunday morning. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to open a full investigation into the firebombing of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence and whether it constitutes a federal hate crime.
Shapiro, his family and guests were awakened and evacuated safely from the Harrisburg residence early Sunday morning after a fire broke out in a public part of the building. Hours earlier, Shapiro, who is Jewish, hosted Passover Seder in the state dining room, which was heavily damaged in the attack.
“Given the deeply troubling allegations that the suspect targeted Governor Shapiro based in part on his religious identity, the April 13 incident warrants immediate and serious federal scrutiny,” Schumer said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
At an event in Harrisburg thanking firefighters Thursday, Shapiro reiterated that he would not weigh in on what the charges should be.
“Let me be very clear, I have total and complete confidence in (Dauphin County) District Attorney Fran Chardo to charge this case as he sees fit, to analyze the evidence, to apply the law and to see the case through,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro said he placed his trust in Chardo’s judgment and that he would respect the Department of Justice’s decision whether to bring federal charges.
“As to Senator Schumer or anybody else, I don’t think it’s helpful for people on the outside who haven’t seen the evidence, who don’t know what occurred, who are applying their own viewpoints to the situation to weigh in, in that manner,” he said.
Authorities quickly concluded the fire was intentionally set. A Harrisburg man who turned himself in to state police later in the day confessed to using Molotov cocktails to start the blaze. He also said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer he carried if he encountered the governor  inside the residence.

Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. He was held without bail in Dauphin County Jail after a hearing Monday.
In an interview with investigators, Balmer said that he felt hatred toward Shapiro. Search warrants for Balmer’s electronic devices and writings released Wednesday revealed he made references to Shapiro and Palestine in a 911 call shortly after the fire when he also made a confession.
“The suspect told 911 operators that Governor Shapiro needs to know the suspect ‘will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people’ and referenced ‘our people’ being harmed by ‘that monster,’ Schumer’s letter says.
“These statements — in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro’s visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country — raise serious concerns about antisemitic motivation,” the letter says.

Shapiro said Bondi was among dozens of officials, former governors and others who offered support and prayers on Sunday. Bondi said in a press briefing Wednesday that she and FBI director Kash Patel spoke with Shapiro after the attack.
She said Wednesday that she firmly believed the attack was intended to kill Shapiro and pledged to work with state authorities to do “anything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars as long as possible.”
Pennsylvania law provides prosecutors the option of adding an “ethnic intimidation” charge when a person commits an underlying offense such as assault, harassment, stalking and other crimes motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of a person or group.
The charge enhances the severity of the offense, which can lead to tougher penalties. If an offense such as assault is graded as a second-degree felony, the ethnic intimidation charge becomes a first-degree felony with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
The Justice Department enforces a number of laws covering crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These include damage to religious property and violent interference with federal protected activities.
The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act covers attempted homicide and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Americans are watching as the new presidential administration dangerously hacks away at institutions of our federal government at the expense of the people, with a slew of executive orders that violate the Constitution and aim to strip Americans of cherished civil liberties they have known for generations.
We can no longer rely on Congress as a backstop. The Trump administration has ordered the Department of Justice to cease all involvement in civil rights cases, including enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which has protected Americans’ right to vote since the civil rights era.
Congress has refused to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and is responsible for continuing to renew the VRA, and federal courts have been slowly eroding federal voting rights protections for years. The Supreme Court has notoriously ruled against landmark provisions of the VRA, like the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision and the 2021 Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee decision.
Yet, in this time of uncertainty and national instability, Colorado can act on its own to strengthen the right to vote for Coloradans.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Bill 25-1, the Colorado Voting Rights Act, will protect the access to the ballot Colorado voters currently have while protecting the state from the dismantling of the federal Voting Rights Act, any federal or state administration changes, and future attempts to undermine fair and accessible elections, regardless of who controls Congress or the White House.
And it’s not just democracy advocates who support this move — two-thirds of Coloradans agree. A new poll from the State Innovation Exchange found that voters support a Colorado Voting Rights Act by a wide margin of 61%, with 46% supporting it strongly, more than all of those who oppose it combined.
Coloradans from all walks of life support the Colorado Voting Rights Act and see it as a policy that protects all communities, not just some, garnering an additional stamp of approval from 64% of centrist voters, and 62% of independent voters.
Despite all the strides Colorado has made in breaking down barriers to voter participation, we still have one of the widest racial turnout gaps in the nation. The COVRA addresses this while codifying anti-discrimination protections into state law.
Specifically, the COVRA will help build a more equitable democracy by setting clear and fair standards to ensure election administrators employ practices that do not create systemic disparities in participation between communities. The COVRA also prohibits election methods that dilute the vote of communities of color, targeting classic cases of gerrymandering that result in communities being underrepresented.
All local jurisdictions in Colorado are already subject to anti-discrimination standards under the federal VRA. Unlike the federal VRA, the COVRA is designed to help resolve disagreements over election rules outside of court whenever possible. Local governments would remain free to continue running their elections independently and according to their own rules and practices; the new bill simply sets standards in state law to prevent and address discriminatory practices.
Additionally, the bill creates explicit protections for LGBTQ+ voters, voters with disabilities, and eligible voters who are confined in jail during an election so that every Coloradan with the right to vote is protected under state law.
Colorado must take decisive action to protect our civil rights and liberties before it is too late. Our attorney general currently lacks the authority to enforce the VRA, and we need to equip our state to defend voting rights if federal protections fall.
Democracy includes everyone — no matter their race, background, ZIP code, or income — and every single eligible Coloradan deserves to fairly cast a ballot.
The Colorado Voting Rights Act will ensure that every voter’s voice is protected in future elections, no matter who is in charge.

“Let me be very clear, I have total and complete confidence in (Dauphin County) District Attorney Fran Chardo to charge this case as he sees fit, to analyze the evidence, to apply the law and to see the case through,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro said he placed his trust in Chardo’s judgment and that he would respect the Department of Justice’s decision whether to bring federal charges.
“As to Senator Schumer or anybody else, I don’t think it’s helpful for people on the outside who haven’t seen the evidence, who don’t know what occurred, who are applying their own viewpoints to the situation to weigh in, in that manner,” he said.
Authorities quickly concluded the fire was intentionally set. A Harrisburg man who turned himself in to state police later in the day confessed to using Molotov cocktails to start the blaze. He also said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer he carried if he encountered the governor  inside the residence.

Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. He was held without bail in Dauphin County Jail after a hearing Monday.
In an interview with investigators, Balmer said that he felt hatred toward Shapiro. Search warrants for Balmer’s electronic devices and writings released Wednesday revealed he made references to Shapiro and Palestine in a 911 call shortly after the fire when he also made a confession.
“The suspect told 911 operators that Governor Shapiro needs to know the suspect ‘will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people’ and referenced ‘our people’ being harmed by ‘that monster,’ Schumer’s letter says.
“These statements — in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro’s visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country — raise serious concerns about antisemitic motivation,” the letter says.

Shapiro said Bondi was among dozens of officials, former governors and others who offered support and prayers on Sunday. Bondi said in a press briefing Wednesday that she and FBI director Kash Patel spoke with Shapiro after the attack.
She said Wednesday that she firmly believed the attack was intended to kill Shapiro and pledged to work with state authorities to do “anything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars as long as possible.” 
Pennsylvania law provides prosecutors the option of adding an “ethnic intimidation” charge when a person commits an underlying offense such as assault, harassment, stalking and other crimes motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of a person or group. 
The charge enhances the severity of the offense, which can lead to tougher penalties. If an offense such as assault is graded as a second-degree felony, the ethnic intimidation charge becomes a first-degree felony with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
The Justice Department enforces a number of laws covering crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These include damage to religious property and violent interference with federal protected activities. 
The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act covers attempted homicide and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Free.,Federal appeals court temporarily freezes multibillion-dollar Biden climate fund,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-temporarily-freezes-multibillion-dollar-biden-climate-fund,,"WASHINGTON — The legal battle over a Biden-era climate program ramped up late Wednesday when an appeals court halted a federal judge’s ruling requiring the disbursement of those funds.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will keep funds frozen in Citibank accounts while a federal suit over the program is ongoing.The appeals court order reversed a preliminary injunction that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia issued Tuesday that temporarily barred the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from “unlawfully suspending or terminating” grant awards.The appeals panel said it had not had access to Chutkan’s opinion explaining her order granting an injunction — which came a day after the order itself — and the trial judge had therefore not met the high bar needed to issue a preliminary injunction. The panel’s order “should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,” the judges said.“The purpose of this order is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the district court’s forthcoming opinion in support of its order granting a preliminary injunction together with” the government’s appeal, the judges wrote.Chutkan issued her opinion the day after granting the preliminary injunction, pointing out that “for weeks, despite repeated inquiries to Citibank and EPA, Plaintiffs received little to no communication from EPA or Citibank regarding their inability to access their funds.”“Overnight, billions of dollars appropriated by Congress were frozen. As a result, nationwide projects were halted, workplans were disrupted, and millions of dollars in approved transactions with committed partners could not be disbursed,” she wrote.Fight over fundingClimate United Fund and other organizations sued President Donald Trump’s administration and Citibank in March over money frozen in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.The $27 billion initiative, which provides funding to organizations building for energy-efficient projects and other measures to tackle climate change, was authorized by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed along party lines and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022.Chutkan’s order blocked the administration from “directly or indirectly impeding” Citibank or causing the bank to “deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise limit access to funds in accounts established in connection with” the organizations’ grants.The Trump administration quickly challenged that ruling Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.The higher court temporarily blocked Chutkan’s decision “pending further order.”The appeals court’s ruling halts Chutkan’s preliminary injunction to the extent that it “enables or requires Citibank to release, disburse, transfer, otherwise move, or allow access to funds.”The higher court also prevented the Trump administration from having to file a status report with the district court within 24 hours of the preliminary injunction’s entry that confirmed their compliance, as outlined in Chutkan’s ruling.The appeals court also ordered that “no party take any action, directly or indirectly, with regard to the disputed contracts, grants, awards or funds.”The EPA said in March it would be terminating $20 billion in grants under the program, and the agency’s administrator Lee Zeldin described the climate initiative as a “gold bar” scheme.Climate United Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, and the EPA declined to comment.",,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

(Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries)This story was originally published by The Appeal.
As U.S. homelessness rates reach record highs, President Donald Trump has pledged to ban street camping, relocate unhoused people to privately-managed “tent cities,” and arrest anyone caught violating the new laws.
But while Trump’s threats certainly sound draconian, they’re not exactly novel. In recent years, several states have organized increasingly harsh homeless sweeps — perhaps most typified by Louisiana, where the governor recently oversaw a possible model for the sort of mass relocation that Trump has promised.
Federal officials seem to be taking note. According to a local official who spoke to The Appeal, in early February, Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem quietly visited a warehouse where Gov. Jeff Landry had relocated nearly 200 homeless people, sometimes under threat of arrest. And in March, Trump appointed Madison Sheahan, a state official whose agency enforced Landry’s crackdown, to become deputy director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheahan, who is 28, was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) by Landry in 2023, though she had no background in conservation or ecology. She previously worked on Noem’s campaign for South Dakota governor and was executive director of the Republican Party there, where she worked on banning trans athletes from college sports. Otherwise, her qualifications are questionable: besides issuing rules for sawfish harvesting and letting military veterans hunt bears, Sheahan’s most relevant experience over the last year seems to be lending her officers to Landry to round up homeless residents.

 
Attorneys for the unhoused have now filed a class action suit against the state — including Sheahan’s LDWF — to block Landry’s crackdown. As the case unfolds in New Orleans’ civil district court, Louisiana’s situation could serve as a bellwether for how Trump 2.0 will address unsheltered homelessness—and even the detention of migrants.
Jesse Rabinowitz, communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center, called Sheahan’s promotion “really concerning.” He added that what’s happening in New Orleans is “a real-life example of what could happen on a larger scale.”
The sweeps by Louisiana state agencies are part of “how conservative electives can punish people living in more progressive parts of the state,” warned Rabinowitz. “They did it with migrants, and they’ve said they’re going to do it with homeless folks. And we have to believe them.”

Louisiana’s crackdown began during singer Taylor Swift’s October tour dates in New Orleans. In the days leading up to the concerts, Landry directed Louisiana State Police (LSP) and LDWF officers to “sweep” downtown encampments of hundreds of unhoused people, pushing them all into one designated area a few blocks away. The sweeps drew national attention.
City council members and Mayor LaToya Cantrell condemned Landry’s actions. One council member’s chief of staff later said in an affidavit that, when she visited the government-run encampment, “one gentleman asked me where he could get a tent,” because state officers had thrown his away.
As a result, she said, “he got bitten by rats the night before because he did not have a tent to go inside.”
Lawyers representing unhoused people swiftly sued. But the ensuing court battle took a worrying turn in January, when the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that cities cannot abridge the state’s police power. LSP can now conduct sweeps without following city ordinances, meaning they don’t have to provide sufficient warning beforehand. That ruling could signal to other red states that courts will let them send state agencies into blue cities, such as Austin or Nashville, and ignore any municipal-level protections in place.
A week after that ruling, LSP and DWF officers again descended on downtown New Orleans’ encampments. This time, they sent more than 100 people to a warehouse seven miles away called the “Transition Center.” Attorneys for the unhoused demanded another restraining order, but courts denied the request.
“Governor Landry’s interest in moving the encampments was to provide warm shelter and a place for the unhoused to be secure from potential harm during the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras,” a judge wrote.


The Transition Center sat in a former packaging warehouse alongside New Orleans’ industrial canal. While the press was not allowed in, photos shared from within the Center show rows of cots separated by black cloths, and some couches facing a television, in a warehouse with no eye-level windows. Residents reportedly received three meals daily and could leave freely, though neither a bus stop nor sidewalk sits near the site. Access was restricted to those with authorization.
Several service organizations worked in the warehouse. After initial difficulties, some employees say the remaining residents were satisfied with conditions. A medical worker told The Appeal he appreciated seeing patients consistently, and “we were able to get people healthier than when they arrived.”
Now that those events have finished, the warehouse has closed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the initial October sweeps, a judge ordered LSP and LDWF to “not destroy or dispose of the property of unhoused people without judicial process” and to provide notice of sweeps as set out in New Orleans’ municipal ordinances.
But the New Year’s Day truck attack that killed 14 people in New Orleans, including a sleeping unhoused person, seems to have changed the calculus. Within hours, Landry issued an executive ordergiving him emergency powers to “direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population, from any stricken or threatened area.” The following week, the Louisiana Supreme Court dissolved the preliminary injunction. One justice wrote that, in the wake of the Jan. 1 attack, the sweeps were “about public safety.”
Court affidavits show how the case has already emboldened police to criminalize people experiencing homelessness.
According to the lawsuit, 12 LDWF officers and “five or six” LSP troopers approached 32-year-old plaintiff Raymond Scott when the major sweeps began in January. Scott is unhoused and has already lost valuables during sweeps. Last summer, a city worker reached into his tent and took a treasured owl figurine Scott inherited from his great-grandmother, then disposed of it even as Scott “begged them not to take it,” according to a court affidavit he later filed.
“You have two choices,” a trooper said. “Come willingly, or we cuff you, detain you, and bring you to the Transition Center.”
Scott said he didn’t want to go.
“You know you can be arrested for being homeless now?” a trooper allegedly replied. Scott then said he wanted to call his lawyer.
Scott’s attorneys argue that the US Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson does not permit Landry’s sweeps, since Grants Pass concerned whether arresting people for sleeping outside violates the 8th Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishments. In this case, the attorneys allege Louisiana violated unhoused residents’ 4th and 14th Amendment rights.
Another resident, Michael Garner, asserts in the suit that seven or eight LSP troopers approached his camp and told him to pack up. When he asked if he could leave, a trooper said he was being detained.
“The troopers told me that I would not be free to leave until I was brought to the Transition Center,” Garner wrote. He says he packed everything he owned into a box and got on the bus. When he later tried to fetch his belongings — including his social security card, birth certificate, and a bicycle —“officials told me that they could not find the box.”
Last week, attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the suit voluntarily. The legal team declined to comment on that request, as the motion is pending.
Sheahan, who’s set to begin her role at ICE in the coming weeks, ran the LDWF when its officers conducted the sweeps. In a March 11 Fraternal Order of Police statement celebrating her promotion, Patrick Yoes, National President of the FOP, celebrated that she’d “established a Special Operations Group within the enforcement division” for events like the Super Bowl. According to a November Facebook post, state police officers trained LDWF’s new special-ops team. Sheahan also joined Landry and DHS Secretary Noem for a briefing on Super Bowl security measures when Noem visited in February.
LDWF agents typically enforce hunting, fishing, and boating regulations. An LDWF spokesperson did not answer questions about why the agency took part in homeless sweeps.

 
Advocates have decried the sweeps and “transition center” as both cruel and ineffective. But at the state level, officials have celebrated their success.
“We think this is absolutely going to be looked at as a success, because we were able to get people out of harm’s way just weeks after a terror attack in that same area,” a spokesperson for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) told The Appeal. The state closed the Transition Center on March 21.


The spokesperson said that, from a peak of 183 people, 108, or about 60 percent, received permanent housing by the time the center closed.
An additional 59 people left on their own, while 15 others moved into a different shelter downtown. The center’s final costs could exceed $17.5 million.
But some housing advocates say the sweeps undermined the city-level housing efforts that have been ongoing since 2023. Those programs have housed more than 822 people at a much lower cost per person. Critics also say the warehouse sweeps disrupted contact between unhoused people and their case workers and service providers. The National Homelessness Law Center’s Rabinowitz stressed that the only real fix is affordable housing.
“There’s consensus that housing solves homelessness, and throwing people in jail and forcing homeless people into camps is not the solution,” he said. “But the people that are put in charge don’t seem to be motivated by helping people. They seem to be motivated by this desire to police and punish people for struggling in a country where a lot of people are struggling to make ends meet.”

A philosopher with more than two decades in academic leadership roles is the next provost and vice president of academic affairs for Rhode Island College (RIC)
Manyul Im will leave his current position as provost and vice president at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut for his new role starting July 1. He will be RIC’s first permanent provost in roughly three years.
Im will replace Sheila Flemming, who has served as RIC’s interim provost since September 2024. Flemming, who did not apply for the permanent position, came on board after the departure of Carolynn Masters, who served since 2022 as interim provost. Masters was appointed after the departure of Helen Tate, who was named provost in 2020. 
In higher education, provosts typically typically serve as chief academic officers and oversee the entirety of a school’s academic affairs, faculty, curriculum development and approval, and academic support for students.
The Council on Postsecondary Education, which oversees public higher ed in Rhode Island, approved Im’s appointment Wednesday night. RIC announced the appointment in an email to the campus community Thursday.
“I entered academia because of the opportunity it gave me as a first-generation college student to go beyond the dreams of professional, economic success that my immigrant parents had for me,” Im said in a statement. “I wanted to discover the foundations for a meaningful life and try to contribute something to the lives of others.” 
“I have sought out institutions of higher education where there were strong commitments to academic quality and mission-driven efforts to provide diversity and inclusivity support, professional curricular content, as well as an intellectual life of the mind in a global context,” Im continued.
Im has a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley. His master’s and doctorate degrees in philosophy come from the University of Michigan. Im’s research focus lies in the wide and storied range of Chinese philosophy, plus the ancient Greeks, the history of western philosophy and ethics. Since 2009, Im co-publishes a blog called Warp Weft and Way, which looks at Chinese philosophy in a comparative light. 
Im graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s professional development program in 2016, according to his LinkedIn.
Im has worked in different roles at Bridgeport since 2014, including dean of arts and sciences and associate provost. During his tenure, Im led academic efforts to bolster the schools’ health sciences, human services, and nursing offerings, and he helped launch a professional development initiative for faculty, the Universal Design for Learning. Additionally, he helped tailor a recruitment strategy for international students, and oversaw the creation of the Heckman Center for student support and career development. 
Prior to Bridgeport, Im worked in leadership and as faculty at Fairfield University, California State University, Los Angeles, and the University of Oklahoma. As a professor at these schools, Im taught a range of courses from intro-level philosophy to Confucianism, Daosim, and seminars on broader topics like ethics, free will and human destiny.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-income-tax-hikes-on-rich/,"Boosting the two highest marginal rates on the CT income tax would affect couples earning more than $500,000 and singles over $250,000.","The state Senate’s leaders unveiled a new proposal Thursday to boost taxes on Connecticut’s high earners, seeking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to mitigate anticipated deep cuts in federal aid to health care, education and other core programs here.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, in a joint statement with Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, recommended boosting the two highest marginal rates on the state income tax, which would generate revenue from single filers earning more than $250,000 per year and couples topping $500,000. 
The state income tax has seven different rates, taxing various portions of household income between 2% to 6.99%. Most middle-class income is taxed between 4.5% and 6%.
Looney and Duff’s plan would boost the tax rate from:

6.9% to 7.5% for all earnings between $250,000 and $500,000 by single filers, and between $500,000 and $1 million by married couples.
6.99% to 7.99% for all earnings greater than $500,000 by single filers and above $1 million by married couples.

Though the state Senate Democratic leadership office hadn’t completed projections on the full revenue impact early Thursday afternoon, it estimated boosting the 6.99% rate to 7.99% would generate more than $420 million per year.
The Democratic leaders say these higher rates would be offered if the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald J. Trump follow through on plans to extend 2017 federal income tax cuts set to expire after this year, a move that would chiefly benefit households making more than $320,000 annually. 
To pay for that tax relief, Congress is eyeing $880 billion in federal budget cuts, a move that likely would cost state and municipal government here more than $1 billion in federal aid for Medicaid, special education, food stamps, higher education research grants, and other programs.
“In. the wake of yet another federal tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans, Connecticut cannot afford to fail to take action at a time of crisis,” Looney said. “If Washington insists on handing billionaires another tax break, we will ensure some of that windfall comes back to the people of Connecticut to help deal with the massive federal cuts we anticipate.”
Duff added “this is a proactive, conditional measure that protects core services, invests in education and infrastructure, and maintains a level playing field.”
Looney and Duff’s comments come a few days after dozens of progressives in the General Assembly appealed for state tax hikes on the wealthy to help offset likely deeper cuts in federal aid to Connecticut.
But despite those sentiments, it remained unclear Thursday whether Connecticut would break from a recent trend and consider any tax hikes aimed solely at high-earners.
Gov. Ned Lamont has consistently blocked any effort to raise taxes on the wealthy since he took office in 2019, backed by other fiscally moderate Democrats and minority Republicans in the state House and Senate.
And Lamont, who says boosting state taxes on the rich would prompt them to flee Connecticut, has said it’s premature to discuss raising levies on them now before the federal budget picture has been resolved.
This marks the fifth consecutive year that Looney has introduced bills to boost income tax rates on the capital gains earnings of rich households, and to create a so-called “mansion tax” — a statewide property levy on high-value homes. But legislative leaders have never included these proposals once in the final budget package negotiated with Lamont.
“Despite the unpredictability coming out of Washington, the [Lamont] administration is having ongoing discussions with legislative leadership about a path forward, after we see a final federal budget and know its impact on Connecticut,” Chris Collibee, the governor’s budget spokesman, said Thursday. “Especially in light of recent economic concerns, his preference is increasing the number of taxpayers in our state, rather than increasing taxes.”
Republicans in the General Assembly also are pressing Lamont to avoid raising state taxes. The first step toward responding to any cuts from Washington, they say, is to look for options to trim spending at the state level.
“Democrats worship at the altar of government spending,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who said neither Democratic legislators nor Lamont have responded seriously to recent instances of inefficiency or malfeasance.
Candelora noted that public colleges and universities here entered the fiscal year holding more than $1 billion in reserves, even as they appealed to legislators for more state funding. The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges and regional state universities, held more than $610 million of those stockpiled funds.
The GOP leader also cited a recent report from the state auditors showing state officials mismanaged audits for Connecticut’s school construction program in recent years and failed to enforce price caps that are meant to hold down costs for local school building projects.
“Not only do they [Democrats] not care about the stockpiling and hoarding of money, they also don’t care about the criminal misuse of money,” Candelora added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-6.25.58-PM.png,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

The Milford Museum will continue its American History Series on Saturday, May 10, with a deep dive into one of the region’s most important agricultural legacies: the canning industry.
The presentation, led by agricultural historian and former Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Ed Kee, will take place at 1:00 p.m. at the Milford Public Library.
For more than a century, the Delmarva Peninsula and Baltimore were at the heart of the nation’s canned food industry. From the 1840s through the 1940s, canneries dotted the landscape, transforming the area into a major hub of food processing.

By the end of the 19th century, Maryland boasted more than 387 canneries, while Delaware had 49—growing to 111 by 1919. At its peak, Delaware’s canning industry employed over 1,800 workers.
Locally, Milford was home to as many as eight canneries operating well into the 1960s.
Other towns like Frederica, Harrington, Bridgeville, Lincoln City, and Milton also played a role, with most canneries specializing in tomatoes. Nearly every town in Kent and Sussex Counties hosted a facility.
However, as competition from states like California increased, the industry began to decline.
Today, four vegetable processing firms still operate in the region—two in Delaware, one in New Jersey, and one in Maryland—processing crops like peas, lima beans, and sweet corn. Of the four, three are now freezing operations, and just one continues canning.
Ed Kee
Ed Kee brings a wealth of experience and scholarship to the discussion.
With a career that includes three decades at the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension and two terms as Delaware’s Secretary of Agriculture, Kee has authored more than 30 scholarly articles and five books on agricultural history.
He was instrumental in founding LEAD Delaware and helped create the Delaware Young Farmers Program, which offers 0% interest loans to beginning farmers.
The event is free and open to the public. It is part of a monthly series sponsored by the Milford Museum and funded by the Delaware Heritage Commission. Each program focuses on topics in local, state, or national history and is held on the second Saturday of the month at the Milford Public Library, located at 11 S.E.

In naming Driskell Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear said she has “made a real impact on the commonwealth’s rich literary community through her poetry and passion for teaching.” 
Driskell, the author of multiple books of poetry, has been honored with  the Appalachian Review’s Denny C. Plattner Award in Creative Nonfiction. She has received grants from the Kentucky Arts Council and the Kentucky Foundation for Women among other honors. 
Her published books include “Goat-Footed Gods,” “Blue Etiquette: Poems,” “Next Door to the Dead” and “Seed Across Snow.” 
She also serves as the chair of Spalding University’s Naslund-Mann Graduate School of Writing in Louisville. Driskell will serve as the poet laureate from 2025-2026.

“All genres of art are important, but there’s something particularly humane about the work writers bring us,” Driskell said in the Capitol rotunda Thursday. 
“Language and creativity at the end are largely qualities that make us human. And so it’s not surprising that for so many of us, when we find our writing lives, we find our authentic lives,” she said. “We deepen our own ability to practice compassion, and we make lasting connections with our loved ones, our communities, and we carry our history forward.” 
House, who was appointed in 2023 and was the state’s first openly gay poet laureate, held writing workshops throughout the state and created an oral history project, among other initiatives during his tenure. 
“It has been such an honor to serve as poet laureate for the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the past two years,” House said. “In that time, this work has made my love for the state only deepen.

House, who was a rural mail carrier in his native Eastern Kentucky, is author of many articles and novels, including “Clay’s Quilt,” “A Parchment of Leaves,” “Eli the Good” and “Lark Ascending.”
“My number one goal has always been to make more people aware how rich our literature is here in Kentucky, and to make writing instruction more accessible,” House said.  
Driskell will be inducted into House’s current role on April 24 in the rotunda. Both she and House will hold readings during that event.

House Bil 432 directs the Revenue Law Study Committee to study options to enhance such programs and to consider other tax reforms to reduce property tax burdens for low-income elderly and disabled residents and disabled veterans.

“This is a study bill and the reason we need this study bill is because other states have done things to protect their homeowners that I think we can follow,” said Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus), a bill cosponsor. “We have some states that have 100% property tax exclusions for veterans. They have better exclusions for the elderly and disabled.”
Big concerns, Echevarria said, are rising taxes and property tax revaluations, which are making it difficult for residents on fixed incomes to remain in their homes. Cabarrus County has been “decimated” by property revaluations and tax increases, he said.
“I’m sure that I’m not the only one who has received phone calls from the elderly, from the disabled, those on fixed incomes who simply don’t know how they’re going to keep up with increasing property taxes,” Echevarria said.
Several Democrats spoke in support of HB 432, including Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) who said he 100% backs the tax relief study.
“I’ve been worried about older people in my communities … [who] might eventually lose their homes because the property taxes are going up and up and up and their income is fixed,” Jones said. “I’m sure there’s nobody in here doesn’t know anybody like that.”
  Rep. Carla Cunningham (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) noted that several bills have been introduced to provide tax relief for veterans and elderly and disabled North Carolinians. More must be done to keep veterans in the state and to encourage those from the state to return home after separating from the military, she said.
“I do know that we want to move forward to assist the veterans in the State of North Carolina not to leave North Carolina but to come home to North Carolina after they have served and that we should be assisting in any way that we can for them to come back home,” Cunningham said.
She noted that in South Carolina, veterans who are totally or permanently disabled from wartime may receive a property tax exemption on their home.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said the bill is vastly improved compared to previous versions but reminded colleagues that property taxes pay for essential services such as public schools.

“They [property taxes] are not a regressive tax like a sales tax and I don’t want to see a study go into a shift of tax consequences that are more regressive on the poor that they are on the rich,” Morey said.
She asked if bill sponsors had sought input from the NC Association of County Commissioners and the NC League of Municipalities and whether the groups support the bill.
Echevarria said he hadn’t received input from either organization.
North Carolina currently offers three property tax relief programs for qualified homeowners that are administered by counties:

The Elderly/Disabled Homestead Exemption is for residents 65 years or older or those who are totally and permanently disabled. The program excludes from taxes the greater of $25,000 or 50% of the assessed value of the owner’s permanent residence.
The Circuit Breaker limits the amount of annual property taxes the owner pays on their permanent residence. Eligibility is limited to homeowners who are 65 and older or who are totally and permanently disabled. The tax bill is limited to a fixed percentage of income, and any taxes owed above that limit is deferred until a “disqualifying event” such as the owner’s death. This program requires a new application to be filed every year.
The Disabled Veteran Exclusion program excludes up to the first $45,000 of the appraised value of the permanent residence of a disabled veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability or who received benefits for specially adapted housing. There is no age or income limitation for this program.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/development-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards. The lab, near Pittsburgh[...]","An aerial shot of the NIOSH campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County Pennsylvania. (Photo from the CDC)Most Americans learned what an N95 mask was during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Pennsylvania. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”
Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency, virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June. 
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
  ‘Someone will have to own the travesty’ 

Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.
“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.
For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: Escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1.
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June.
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return.
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

Mike Dunleavy vetoed an education funding bill on Thursday, citing a lack of policy changes he supported.
House Bill 69 would have increased the base student allocation — the core of the state’s per-student funding — by $1,000 in the funding formula. The BSA has not been substantially increased for more than a decade, and public school advocates testified that inflation-driven cost increases have resulted in cuts to programs, school closures, and larger class sizes. 
The governor’s veto is subject to a vote of the Alaska Legislature. Under the Alaska Constitution, a vote to confirm or override the vote must be held “immediately,” but multiple lawmakers have said that the bill lacks enough support for a veto override. Votes from 40 of 60 state legislators, meeting in joint session, are needed for an override. 
Last year, the education funding bill included a $680 per-student increase. That bill had broad bipartisan support, with only three Republican legislators voting against it. But after Dunleavy vetoed it, 20 Republicans voted to uphold the veto. This year, all 25 members of the two Republican minority caucuses voted against the bill, as did the three co-chairs of the Senate Finance Committee.

A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.
The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas.
The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.
Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”
NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
Harm to HIV, Vaccine Studies
The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.
Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.
For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”
Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.
“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.
“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
A Hit to Rural Health
Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.
Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”
Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
The NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
Researchers Can’t ‘Just Do It Again Later’
The NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported over 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.
After pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers. “We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
Other researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”
 Methodology

KFF Health News analyzed National Institutes of Health grant data to determine the states and organizations most affected by the Trump administration’s cuts.
We tallied the number of terminated NIH grants using two sources: a Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants published April 4; and a crowdsourced list maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as of April 8. We focused on the first month of terminations: from Feb. 28 to March 28. We found that 780 awards were terminated in total, with 770 of them going to recipients based in U.S. states and two to recipients in Puerto Rico.
The analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements, which we know happened in at least one instance.
Additional information on the recipients, such as location and business type, came from the USAspending.gov Award Data Archive.
There were 222 U.S. recipients in total. At least 94 of them were public higher education institutions. Forty-one percent of organizations that had NIH grants cut in the first month were in states that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election.
Some recipients, including the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are medical facilities associated with higher education institutions. We classified these as hospitals/medical centers.
We also wanted to see whether the grant cuts affected states across the political spectrum. We generally classified states as blue if Democrats control the state government or Democratic candidates won them in the last three presidential elections, and red if they followed this pattern but for Republicans. Purple states are generally presidential battleground states or those where voters regularly split their support between the two parties: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was also blue.
We found that, of affected U.S. institutions, 96 were in red or purple states and 124 were in blue states.

(Courtesy photo)The state’s biggest electrical utility said it shut off power to about 2,300 customers in Las Vegas Thursday in a pre-emptive move to prevent wildfires. 
PNM says it initiated the “public safety power shutoff” at 11:30 a.m. in the Northern New Mexico town. The outage could last up to 48 hours depending on conditions, officials said.
The area is experiencing extreme fire conditions, thanks to prolonged drought, large buildup of fuel, high temperatures, low humidity and increased winds, according to PNM. A National Weather Service high wind warning says gusts could reach 65 mph. 
“The decision to shut off power will be made only as a last resort to protect lives and property from the threat of wildfire,” PNM officials said in a news release earlier Thursday.
All of New Mexico is under either a high wind or Red Flag warning imposed by the National Weather Service, which indicates high wildfire risk. The high wind warning is in effect through most of northwestern New Mexico, including Las Vegas, and the Red Flag warning is in effect everywhere else. 
PNM has warned repeatedly this year that it could impose  pre-emptive power shutoffs, including in East Mountains of Albuquerque, Las Vegas and elsewhere, though it had not yet done so until Thursday. 
The utility has never done a pre-emptive shutoff before, officials said at a recent news conference, but said it is increasingly necessary due to extreme wildfire conditions.
The utility has also been sued for wildfires in recent years, including the McBride Fire in Ruidoso. A law firm accused it of negligence for allowing a tree to be blown onto a powerline it controls, but the utility has denied any liability.

Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, sits at her desk on the Senate floor. Carter has filed a bill for three consecutive years on school accreditation and accountability (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate sent a bill to the House Thursday that would overhaul the state’s accreditation and accountability system in order to give local school districts more control.
State Sen. Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, has filed the bill for three consecutive years and garnered approval for public-school advocates in committee. But each year it has been passed over for other priorities when it reached the full Senate.
Skepticism from state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, slowed the bill’s passage this year and inspired a lengthy debate about accountability earlier this month. 
But Monday, he applauded Carter for “helping work through the concerns that I had.”
Carter tweaked the legislation Monday to clarify sections and add an expiration date to a provision limiting the State Board of Education’s authority to classify districts.
It was approved by the Senate Thursday on a 32 to one vote, with Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman as the only opponent. 
If the bill passes the House, school districts will be able to seek accreditation from national accreditation agencies in addition to the State Board of Education. The board can classify districts without outside accreditation as provisionally accredited or unaccredited only for the purpose of determining whether a charter school can open within a district’s boundaries. State law allows charters to open the area of unaccredited districts and those that have been provisionally accredited for at least three years.
Carter’s legislation also requires schools to post performance data on their websites. Previous versions of the bill specified the data would be sent to “media outlets serving the district.”
It also changes a requirement for “interim assessments” at the beginning and end of the school year to “local assessments” without specified times.
Carter believes the legislation would give school boards and parents more power over curriculum and personalize learning to a district’s needs.
“I think this is a first step in trying to mitigate a lot of the concerns that we’ve had and educators have had in our public schools,” she said Monday.
There is just under a month remaining in the current legislative session. If Carter’s bill doesn’t pass the House in coming weeks, she will have to start over in the process next year.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate has sent a bill to Gov. Kim Reynolds’s desk that would bar penalization from accreditors to universities for following state law, despite concerns from some lawmakers that it would not prevent universities from potentially losing accreditation.
House File 295 would bar higher education accrediting bodies from taking negative action against state universities that follow or refuse to be noncompliant with state law, like legislation passed in the state prohibiting universities from funding or maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices.
The bill also removes mention of the Higher Learning Commission and replaces it with “any federally recognized accreditor of postsecondary educational institutions,” a move Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said could lead to universities choosing lower-quality accreditors and “call into question” students’ degrees.
“I think that we are heading down a path that is creating political cover for laws that are being passed that conflict with gold standards of higher education,” Winckler said.

Sens. Janice Weiner of Iowa City and Herman Quirmbach of Ames agreed with Winckler, saying if Iowa universities stop using the “gold standard” Higher Learning Commission, students may choose to take their tuition dollars somewhere else and education in Iowa could deteriorate as a result.
Weiner reiterated that legislation to create a center for intellectual freedom at the University of Iowa could endanger the university’s accreditation, and said the introduction of House File 295 told her “the majority party knowingly is putting the university’s accreditation at risk.”
“We could be voting, and we could be focusing on helping UIHC find a cure for the cancer plague in this state. Instead, we’re dealing with a bill that knowingly risks the school’s accreditation,” Weiner said. “It’s like we’ve stepped through the looking glass.”
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, said there was “a little bit of exaggeration” in the comments from his colleagues about the dangers of Iowa universities losing accreditation or using lower-quality accreditors. He doesn’t expect any problems to arise with current or proposed legislation, including the bill to establish the UI intellectual freedom center.
The bill passed with a 32-15 vote.
“You know, these past couple weeks, we have heard a lot of concern about intellectual freedom, diversity, allowing both sides to speak,” Gruenhagen said. “Instituting this in a college should have been an easy ‘yes’ vote for both sides of this chamber, according to floor arguments that I’ve been hearing. Unfortunately, we did not hear those. We did not receive a yes. Here’s another chance to say ‘yes’ to provide opportunities.”

The 314-page VDH report, based on a […]","Richmond resident Kyle Levesque takes water samples from Wayside Spring in the Forest Hill neighborhood to be tested during a citywide water outage in Richmond, Jan. 9, 2025. (Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) on Wednesday issued a blistering final report on the January water crisis that left Richmond residents and businesses without clean drinking water for days — and delivered a second formal notice of violation against the city, demanding a full corrective action plan.
The 314-page VDH report, based on a 60-day independent investigation by the engineering firm Short Elliott Hendrickson (SEH), found a long chain of preventable failures at the city’s 100-year-old Water Treatment Plant. 
These included neglected maintenance, faulty backup systems, poor emergency planning, and risky decisions that left the plant vulnerable during a winter storm. A single power outage on the morning of Jan. 6 led to catastrophic flooding of underground equipment rooms, halting water production and triggering a system-wide drop in pressure that forced boil water advisories across the city and surrounding counties for nearly a week.
“This crisis could have been prevented with better operational decisions,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton, who described the findings in stark terms. “Our goal now is to ensure corrective actions are taken swiftly and effectively, so Richmond-area families can trust their water supply.”
The report revealed that city officials were operating the plant in “winter mode,” relying solely on overhead power lines despite known flood risks and vulnerabilities. When those lines failed, the backup systems didn’t work — largely because of neglected maintenance. Critical batteries weren’t tested. Key valves didn’t shut, and manual procedures meant to kick in during emergencies proved ineffective.
In her letter to Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Richmond Mayor Danny Avula, Shelton didn’t mince words. As reported by The Richmonder this week, she contrasted VDH’s investigation with the city’s own internal review, asserting that “the water crisis was completely avoidable and should not have happened.”
Youngkin echoed that sentiment in a statement Wednesday, calling the disruption of a safe and reliable water supply “unacceptable.” He said, “It should never happen again, and I’ve directed the Department of Health to ensure Richmond takes all corrective actions necessary to achieve that objective.” 
The governor praised Richmond-area residents for their resilience, saying they “persevered through this preventable crisis,” and now city leaders must “step up for their citizens.”
The report outlines a cascade of failures triggered by a relatively minor snow and ice event. 
Around 5:45 a.m. on Jan. 6, the Water Treatment Plant lost power. A bus tie switch designed to transfer power from a backup source failed, and for over an hour, the facility operated in the dark. Water continued to flow through the plant by gravity — into a subsurface clearwell — but without power, key valves stayed open. 
Water inundated the underground equipment rooms, flooding critical pumps and electrical systems. Backup batteries, which were supposed to shut valves and prevent flooding, had not been maintained and failed.
By the time the city issued a Boil Water Advisory that afternoon, it was already too late. Pressure had dropped below safe levels, and the city struggled for days to restore full water service. Water production was partially restored on Jan. 8, and fully restored the next day. The boil order wasn’t lifted until Jan. 11.
The VDH and SEH review paints a broader picture of systemic dysfunction at the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). Investigators described a “culture of complacency,” where staff had normalized working around broken or substandard systems instead of fixing them. Manual operation was routine. Training was limited. And serious risks — like flooding from the clearwell — were well known but never resolved.
Despite this, officials say there are signs of progress. 
Mayor Danny Avula said he was “incredibly proud” of the work DPU Director Scott Morris and his team have done since the crisis, noting that much of the VDH’s report aligns with an independent investigation the city commissioned from the firm HNTB. 
“We’ll of course review it and think through the best ways to integrate its recommendations into our work moving forward,” Avula said in a statement.
The city has already spent $5 million on emergency repairs and is proposing more than $60 million in upgrades as part of its five-year capital improvement plan. The plan includes electrical upgrades, automation improvements, and a redesigned overflow system for the clearwell to prevent future flooding. 
Still, the city will now be required to implement a formal Corrective Action Plan under the second notice of violation issued by VDH this week.
Janet Kelly, Virginia’s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, said the water crisis exposed both long-standing infrastructure problems and serious day-of operational failures. 
“An entire region including businesses, restaurants, schools, and the most vulnerable citizens in Richmond lost a basic human need,” she said. “We hope that the city of Richmond continues to address both the long-term and immediate components of this crisis.”
The SEH report also includes a sweeping “needs assessment” of Richmond’s water infrastructure, identifying over $63 million in additional improvements needed across the treatment plant and distribution system. These include relocating vulnerable electrical equipment, installing automated transfer switches, and updating decades-old design elements that are still allowed under legacy exemptions to state water regulations.
In all, the SEH team spent nearly 1,500 hours combing through records, touring facilities, interviewing staff, and analyzing system data. They concluded that while DPU staff showed commitment and technical know-how, the broader system failed to prioritize its most important goal: delivering safe, reliable water to the people of Richmond.
To help local businesses and nonprofits recover from the storm’s economic toll, Youngkin also announced Wednesday that the U.S. Small Business Administration has made Economic Injury Disaster Loans available. These loans aim to help organizations hurt by January’s power and water outages to cover ongoing operational costs.
Looking ahead, the state says it will work closely with city officials to ensure every recommendation is taken seriously. 
“We can’t afford another crisis like this,” said Shelton. “And we won’t accept another excuse.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos / NJ Monitor)The New Mexico Court of Appeals this week rejected a challenge to state law prohibiting people convicted of felonies in the past decade from possessing firearms.
A jury convicted Jeremy Romero, of Las Vegas, of unlawfully possessing a firearm and evading Albuquerque police in August 2022, and a judge sentenced him to eight years in prison.
A few days later, he challenged the felon-in-posession statute’s constitutionality, arguing that it violates his Second Amendment right to possess a gun.
In a unanimous opinion published on Wednesday, a three-judge panel at the New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled that the law stands because there’s a long history of Congress and state legislatures disarming people who are a danger to others, so the law itself is constitutional.
In court briefings and at oral arguments in February, Romero’s attorney argued that his prior convictions were for nonviolent offenses, so it was unconstitutional to apply the felon-in-possession statute against him.
Mary Barket, Romero’s public defender, also argued that the country’s historical prohibitions on gun possession weren’t similar enough to New Mexico’s law because they targeted groups during times of war and conflict “that posed an existential threat to the ruling government.”
“I do not think that that is similar to why we’re trying to justify disarming felons, both violent and nonviolent,” Barket told the judges.
The judges weren’t convinced, and ruled that Romero did not challenge the trial court’s findings that he is dangerous based on his criminal history of possessing and selling drugs and escape from house arrest, so the law is also constitutional as it was applied to him.
While the ruling does not create any new rule about what’s needed to prove that someone is dangerous, it does require that for the government to constitutionally apply the felon-in-possession statute to someone, prosecutors “must demonstrate that the defendant presents a threat to others,” the judges wrote.
Romero based his challenge on the legal standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 for analyzing the constitutionality of firearms regulations, in a case called Bruen.
Nonprofit news organization The Trace reviewed more than 2,000 court cases that cited Bruen and found that people whose felony records bar them from possessing guns used the decision more often than any other group.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin sued the messaging app Discord Thursday under the state Consumer Fraud Act, saying the tech giant has failed to protect underage users from sexual predators, harassment, and violent content.
Platkin, who also has sued TikTok and Meta, alleges Discord misleads parents and users about the efficacy of its “porous security features that Discord knows do not work as promised.” The decade-old platform, which caters to teens and gamers, has 200 million users.
“Too often, parents feel helpless as rich and powerful corporations find new ways to put harmful content literally directly into our kids’ hands, callously placing their own profits ahead of the safety and well-being of our children,” Platkin said at a news conference in Newark. 
Platkin pointed to violent incidents involving white supremacists who used the platform to plan or publicize their crimes, including a deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a 2022 mass shooting at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 dead.
Platkin said his office launched its investigation after the Buffalo massacre and found that Discord, even as it publicly promotes its safety measures, fails to enforce them, making it “alarmingly easy for predators and other malicious actors to target children on the app.”
“There’s very little to prevent kids from connecting with and receiving messages from complete strangers on their platform. This includes strangers who are adults pretending to be kids, something that should be a red flag for every parent,” Platkin said.
Discord prohibits children under 13 on its platform, he added, “but it barely enforces its own rule.”
“All a child has to do to access the app is just say they’re 13. Discord will take any 8-year-old’s word for it,” he said.
He added: “There are very few roadblocks between a child under the age of 10 accessing Discord and being groomed in a private chat or coerced to engage in self-harm. It’s horrifying, sickening, and it’s especially horrifying and sickening given that Discord users in New Jersey exchange billions of direct messages on the app every year.”

Officials from Discord, which is based in San Francisco, did not respond to a request for comment.

A proposal that would prohibit local governments from suspending the sale of guns and ammunition during a declared state of emergency was approved in the Florida House on Wednesday.
The measure (HB 6025) sponsored by Brevard County Republicans Monique Miller and Debbie Mayfield, repeals current state law that prohibits the sale of firearms and ammunition during a local state of emergency. The bill would also repeal the prohibition banning anyone intentionally possessing a firearm in a public place during a local emergency.
South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said that he had voted for the bill in an earlier committee meeting, but that upon reading the actual state statute that it would repeal (section 870.044) was now opposing it.
“What we’re saying is that if there’s a riot or public disturbance we’re just going to let everybody sort of willy-nilly, without the controls that we have in place, get their firearms, and that’s adding fuel to that riot,” he said. “That’s adding fuel to that fire.”
Gottlieb added that he believed it had “wide-ranging implications that could endanger us in society.”
But Republicans said it was more than an appropriate change.
“When our communities are ripped by unrest or emergency, when the lights go out and the sirens grow louder and the sense of order is fading, that is precisely the moment when Floridians deserve the freedom to defend themselves, their children, their homes and their livelihoods,” said Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“When I came up here I promised my constituents that one of the most important things that I would do is I would fine laws that violate their constitutional rights, and I would get rid of them,” said Miller. “This is one of the most egregious that I found.”
The measure passed 86-28, mostly along party lines.
The Senate version (SB 952) sponsored by Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia has passed all of its committees and is awaiting a floor vote in that chamber.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gun-2048x1490-1-1024x745.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 13:14:17.555699

(Photo via Getty Images)A University of Iowa student who feels his online security and that of all UI students who use Zoom to access classes has been compromised has brought a lawsuit against the university, alleging negligence and seeking relief and an order for the university to secure its online instruction.
Marc Muklewicz, a 46-year-old criminology student close to finishing his degree, said an unauthorized video taken of him in an online class and posted online led to his learning that anyone with the link to a Zoom course at UI could access it without needing to log in with university credentials or any other form of verification.
The UI has refused to remedy the situation and ensure his and other students’ data is private, Muklewicz said, and he is currently refusing to attend classes until he knows that when he logs into a course, he is safe in doing so.
“I can’t share anything academically, honestly, freely, in any sense of the word, if I can’t assure that my information is being private,” Muklewicz said.

Muklewicz first learned of the video taken of him smoking an e-cigarette during an online course through his wife, who started receiving messages from friends and acquaintances about a post made by an affiliate of Barstool on Instagram featuring the video.
How the video was cut, leaving out the e-cigarette and only showing Muklewicz blowing out smoke, implied to some that he was using drugs during class, Muklewicz said. After realizing the video was taken during class, Muklewicz said he emailed his professor, who reached out to the Office of Student Accountability and reiterated to students that taking recordings like this one is unacceptable.
UI Public Relations Manager Steve Schmadeke said in an email the university employs “standard security protocols” for online courses, including restricting access to “authenticated students who must sign in using their unique UI credentials.”
“Students are expected to follow course policies and the code of student life. That code would apply if an individual were identified secretly recording a classmate using a personal device,” Schmadeke said in his email. “The university also offers support services for any student who may experience a privacy violation.”
Muklewicz said what he heard from the Office of Student Accountability was that identifying whoever took the video would be “difficult,” and the office suggested reaching out to university police and changing his name on Zoom to better protect his privacy.

Using his experience from working for Microsoft and GoDaddy in the past, Muklewicz said he found out about the Zoom security issues while trying to work out for himself who could have taken the video.
“I was like, ‘This is so easy, I’ll identify it in five minutes and throw it back at them,’ but then what I came to quickly find out is, wait a minute, I accidentally was able to log in with no credentials,” Muklewicz said.
According to the UI’s posted information on Zoom security, all meetings have a passcode attached for access, but all invitation links automatically include it so no one needs to enter it themselves.
If Zoom classes are accessible to anyone with the link, Muklewicz said information like students’ names, email addresses, images and other information are vulnerable. Those with more “nefarious” intentions and the know-how could use the data they get from a Zoom class to trace a student’s IP address to their location, if they’re using university wi-fi.
While his professors have understood his concerns and the decision to stop attending classes, Muklewicz said the UI administration’s response is what led him to both file a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, complaint and a lawsuit. FERPA serves to protect student education records in all levels of learning, from elementary to post-secondary.
“If we take this serious, great. We can mitigate anything, any harm that’s been done,” Muklewicz said. “And literally, I think all they have to do is take the default permissions off of Zoom and take that and leave it to admin control.”
He was told by Mike Mueller, associate director of the Office of Student Accountability, that after review of the incident by legal counsel, this incident does not qualify as a FERPA violation as the UI does not maintain Zoom videos.
Counts listed against the university in the lawsuit include negligence, breach of contract, public disclosure of private facts and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and Muklewicz is seeking damages and a requirement that the UI secure its Zoom classes.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee’s legislature recently overwhelmingly passed the Success Sequence Act, requiring public schools to teach about the positive outcomes of a life path that goes, in order: graduation from high school, moving on to jobs or further education, marriage and then having children.  It’s not bad advice, but one wonders about the merits of our state legislature offering it.  After all, we do not have required don’t-run-with-scissors instructional modules, or charity-is-a-good-thing week, and we are still waiting for success to come from decades of harangue-kids-about-drugs modules.
So, what’s really going on here? On one level it’s as simple as our legislators effectively yelling, “Hey, you kids are having sex way too casually and way too early!” One wonders if they ever thought about how the message would have been received decades ago by their teenage selves. Further, it is likely to be as ineffective as abstinence-only sex education. A November 2024 research article in the Journal of School Health put it succinctly, “Multiple studies indicate comprehensive sexuality programs are more effective than abstinence-only programs at reducing risky sexual behavior, and improving knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to sexual activity,” the researchers wrote.
On another level, however, this holds true to a political reality described in the books “Moral Politics” and “Don’t Think of an Elephant!,” both by George Lakoff. Self-described conservatives, and they dominate our state legislature, think of successful and wealthy people as having obtained this status because of moral clarity and good life choices. The impoverished are in that position by laziness, promiscuity, and bad choices. Liberals look more to social conditions; wealth often comes from inheritance, and poverty from things like low wages and poor health care.
‘Success sequence’ bill passes House, heads to governor’s desk for signature

Our legislature’s Success Sequence Act is virtue signaling to voters and not virtue referencing to students. It’s cut-and-paste legislation from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, already adopted by Utah and under consideration in Mississippi, Kentucky, Texas, and Ohio.
Tennessee’s sponsor, Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood, thinks such posturing in favor of nuclear families is the best remedy to poverty. Not exactly, at least not from him. He is in a public policy position so he should approach this from a public policy perspective — increasing the minimum wage, making even more opportunities available for post-secondary education, restricting child labor. Sadly, Bulso — and other lawmakers — are woefully deficient on these policy angles.
Members of the Tennessee legislature also might not be the best ones for giving such success in life advice. Former Sen. Brian Kelsey reported to prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, only to be pardoned by President Trump. A jury found former Sen. Katrina Robinson guilty of wire fraud  Sen. Ken Yager faces Driving Under the Influence charges in Georgia. In January 2021, former House Speaker Glen Casada and several other Tennessee legislators had their homes and offices raided in a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into laundered campaign money. 
Casada and his former chief of staff were indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with theft, bribery, and kickbacks, and the pair will go on trial April 22. Even if all those charged are not convicted, “life success” could be a stretch for their expertise. It’s fine that our legislature wants to pontificate on success in life, as long as they remember they are not the pontiff. We can seek our moral clarity from our pastors, parents, successful relatives, and other positive forces in young lives. As for our legislators, some legislation opening doors for young people would be a better use of their time.

Tillis to help stop Medicaid cuts",Christine Zhu,,,,,https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/advocates-health-providers-urge-sen-tillis-to-help-stop-medicaid-cuts/,"Republicans in Congress are considering up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a program that gives access to health care for about 650,000 North Carolinians.","Dr. Beverly Edwards speaks at a Raleigh press conference at which health providers and advocates called on U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to help stop planned cuts to Medicaid on April 17, 2025 (Photo: Progress NC Action YouTube video)A coalition of progressive advocacy groups joined with local health care providers at a Raleigh press conference Thursday to encourage Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to protect Medicaid amid proposed federal cuts.
The event, which was organized by the Coalition Against Right-Wing Extremism (CARE), was intended to draw attention to a plan developed by congressional Republicans to squeeze $880 billion in cuts from Medicaid, a program that provides access to health care for about 3.1 million North Carolinians. Of that number, about 20% (650,000 people) are covered by Medicaid as a result of the program expansion state lawmakers enacted in 2023, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Beverly Edwards lives in Ahoskie in northeastern North Carolina. A pediatrician serving families in rural areas of the state, she said she sees every day how essential Medicaid is to keeping children and families safe.
“In rural areas, access to health care is already hard to come by,” Edwards said. “There are fewer jobs that offer employee-sponsored health care than in some other areas. That means if people lose their health care through Medicaid, they don’t have any alternatives.”
In Edwards’ community, hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid payments in order to keep their doors open. If there are cuts, the effects would be felt across the area.
“Everyone in our community would be forced to travel even further for emergency care, prenatal care, or surgery, if they can get the care at all,” she said.
Alexandra Sirota, executive director of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, has been at her organization for 15 years.
During that time, she’s documented the way budget and tax policy choices impact opportunity for the state.
“North Carolinians want an economy that works for us all,” Sirota said. “Our elected leaders, through their policy choices, have the power to do just that.”
She called out Tillis for prioritizing wealthy and profitable corporations over North Carolinians and their families.
“We know that Senator Tillis has the power to stop these cuts now, before they ripple through our state and our daily lives, affecting whether North Carolinians can receive medical care, whether the nearest hospital can serve all our families, whether people in our community can afford healthy meals, and whether we can keep our jobs,” she said.
Research released recently by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute found that imposing work requirements on Medicaid enrollees — a cost-cutting idea under consideration in Congress and recently endorsed by North Carolina Republican legislators — would result in as many as 30% of the state’s Medicaid expansion population losing coverage.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dr.-Beverly-Edwards.png,,,2025-04-17 13:14:17.555699

Bettison and police chiefs from Dearborn, Taylor, Livonia and other municipalities came to the Michigan House Government Operations Committee to offer support for a $115 million Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund being considered by lawmakers with the goal of distributing funds to local law enforcement to curb violent crime.
Community violence intervention, or CVI, programs such as ShotStoppers, Detroit Friends & Family and FORCE Detroit were able to reduce violent crime by up to 70%  in some service areas between November 2023 and January 2024, a report from the city found. The three programs in the report engage trusted community members in Detroit neighbors to implement tailored approaches to reduce gun violence in the city.

And though the fund will help to save lives in cities with higher crime rates like Detroit and Flint, Bettison said, many municipalities in Michigan will dramatically benefit from being able to form or strengthen their own CVI programs to curb violence.
Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) went through a list off estimated distributions for communities the members on the committee represent: $176,000 for Owosso, $1.9 million for Flint, $261,000 for Waterford Township, $50,000 for Ludington, nearly $500,000 for Muskegon, $3.2 million for Grand Rapids and $1.1 million for Warren.
In Dearborn, one of Michigan’s most populous cities and neighbor to Detroit, City Police Chief Issa Shahin said in addition to investing in CVIs, his department plans on using funds to hire more staff and officers to respond faster to calls and engage more proactively with neighborhoods before crime can occur.
“This is more than just funding. It’s a commitment to public safety and smart, targeted and responsive to needs on the ground. I’ll just be honest, policing is expensive. Communities want well-staffed, well-trained and well-resourced departments and that costs money,” Shahin said. “This investment allows us to do that on behalf of our officers, our city and our residents.”
The Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund, which was proposed for $75 million last legislative session with bipartisan support has since been increased to $115 million in order to dedicate $40 million to county sheriffs. 
The fund still has bipartisan support in the Republican-majority state House, but GOP leadership has raised concern that the Democratic-led state Senate won’t take up the fund without trying to add other measures to it.

The Government Operations Committee, which has three Republicans and two Democrats, passed the bills that create the fund, HB 4260 and 4261, out of committee unanimously Thursday, urging their colleagues in both chambers of the Legislature to work towards the common goal of safer communities.
Funding public safety “isn’t about politics,” Harris said, “it’s about people.” 
“It’s about real families. It’s about real neighborhoods, and it’s about real law enforcement officers who need backup, and not just in the field, but here in Lansing from us.”

“The children of Delaware have the right to a happy and safe childhood, and it’s our responsibility as adults and organizations to stand up to protect that right,” said Georganne Buccine, YMCA of Delaware Vice President of Youth Development. “By joining in the Five Days of Action campaign, we hope to inspire other organizations and members of our community to create safe spaces that protect children from sexual abuse.”
Pledge and Pinwheels
Throughout the week, YMCA members are encouraged to sign a pledge committing to protect children from abuse. Those who participate will receive a blue pinwheel, the official symbol of child abuse prevention, as a visual show of support. Pinwheels and pledge forms will be available at the front desks of all YMCA of Delaware locations.
Know. See. Respond.
This year’s campaign brings back the “Know. See. Respond.” initiative, supported by child protection organizations including Praesidium, Saprea, and Lauren’s Kids.
The goal is to educate parents, caregivers, and community members on how to recognize warning signs of abuse and take action.
– Know: Learn what questions to ask when enrolling children in camps or activities to ensure abuse prevention policies are in place.
– See: Understand the subtle warning signs of grooming behavior and how to spot them.
– Respond: Use tools like the Trusted Triangle and the Safety NETwork to support children in speaking up and staying safe.
Resources and educational materials can be accessed through the YMCA’s partners and directly on their websites.

Whenever I travel outside the state, I don’t need a sign on the border to know I am home, because as soon as I hit that first pothole, I know I am home. Roads are critical for economic development and growth, and because of this, we understand that not only should they remain well-kept, but also publicly provided. This is a given, but it should not be done in a way that risks doing harm to public programs that millions of Michiganders rely on, such as schools, access to health care and putting food on our table.
Policymakers in Lansing all seem to agree that our roads are a priority. Both in her “Road Ahead Address” and her State of the State Address, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vowed to see her “fix the damn roads” promise to its end. Last month, the Michigan House of Representatives passed a road funding package to fund the fiscal cliff the state is facing, totaling more than $3 billion. The road funding package received bipartisan support, but will likely face revisions in this divided government, all a part of tense budget negotiations that will define the year ahead. 
The problem with this road funding package is not its end goal, but its method. It is full of uncertainty and tepid promises that “critical” programs will not face cuts or funding risks. Apart from a proposed tax increase on motor fuel, offsetting a reduction in the sales tax and a tax hike to pressure corporations to forgo subsidies under a former tax plan, proponents claim no new money is needed to fix the roads. Instead, existing state general fund dollars are shifted to roads and to fill the hole in the school aid fund and in community revenue sharing. Ultimately, the proposal passed by the House last month is estimated to reduce overall general fund revenues from 2026-2031 to the tune of about $17 billion.

However, this is like saying no new money is needed for a brand new car because I can just dip into our child’s college savings account. We have the money, but where we take it from matters a great deal. In fact, this is a worse scenario because, without a corresponding budget, we don’t know what existing programs could be impacted by this road proposal. Risking key programs to fund the roads will only result in a road that goes nowhere. If investments in libraries, child care centers, food banks or local schools are cut to make room for road funding, we’re neglecting what communities need most. Roads are meant to connect us to opportunities and resources, not come at their expense.
Underlying all of this, too, is an assumption that Michigan’s method in determining road funding is accurate. A recent report from the Citizens Research Council of Michigan shows that the way Michigan goes about fixing its roads is deeply flawed and antiquated, warranting investigation into policies that improve efficiency and quality of our road systems as well as how we allocate the dollars. Additionally, our existing formula and budget continue to underfund our public transit system, leading to limited service access all across the state. Michigan lawmakers should reassess how funds are allocated, putting dollars where they matter most. 
Roads connect people and allow Michiganders to take their kids to child care or school, get to the doctor’s office, go grocery shopping and enjoy all of the beauty that Michigan’s parks, lakes and forests provide. We need to know not only where this money is going, but where it is going to be taken from.

Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Desde los primeros días del segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump, los líderes educativos de Connecticut han observado cómo la administración presidencial implementaba una serie de órdenes ejecutivas, recortes de fondos y cambios en la política federal, muchos de los cuales representan cambios drásticos para los estudiantes, las escuelas y los distritos que supervisan.
Los legisladores de Connecticut han expresado abiertamente su temor al peor escenario posible: una reducción o eliminación total de los 550 millones de dólares en fondos federales de los que depende el estado para apoyar la educación pública K-12.
Por ahora, los fondos se mantienen prácticamente intactos. Sin embargo, varias de las acciones de Trump hasta la fecha — en temas como la DEI (diversidad, equidad e inclusión), estudiantes transgénero y protestas en campus — amenazan con recortes en los fondos federales si las escuelas y universidades no cumplen.
Esto es lo que sabemos hasta ahora.
Diversidad, equidad e inclusión
Durante la primera semana del mandato del presidente Trump, emitió una orden que prohíbe la DEI en todas las agencias federales. La semana siguiente, el presidente emitió una orden ejecutiva para eliminar el trato discriminatorio y el adoctrinamiento, incluyendo los basados ​​en la ideología de género y la ideología discriminatoria de equidad, en las escuelas primarias y secundarias, solicitando reducciones en la financiación federal para las escuelas que no cumplan.
A principios de este mes, el problema se agravó cuando el Departamento de Educación envió una carta instando a los funcionarios educativos estatales de todo el país, a que certificaran su cumplimiento de sus obligaciones antidiscriminatorias para continuar recibiendo asistencia financiera federal. 
Esta semana, Connecticut anunció que no cumplirá con las demandas de terminar con las prácticas de diversidad, equidad e inclusión en sus escuelas K-12, una decisión que probablemente pondrá al estado en un enfrentamiento con la administración Trump.
El Departamento de Defensa también ha suspendido las admisiones con enfoque racial en las academias militares, incluyendo la Academia de la Guardia Costera en New London. En febrero, el Departamento de Educación emitió una carta amenazando con retener la financiación a las instituciones educativas que consideran la raza en sus admisiones y programas. A mediados de marzo, la Universidad de Yale se encontraba entre las docenas de universidades incluidas en un comunicado del Departamento de Educación, que alegaba prácticas excluyentes en las admisiones de posgrado.
Desmantelamiento del Departamento
A principios de marzo, el Departamento de Educación anunció que reduciría su plantilla aproximadamente a la mitad. El Fiscal General de Connecticut, William Tong, se unió a un grupo de estados para demandar a la administración por los recortes de personal, y el caso está pendiente.
El 20 de marzo, el presidente Trump firmó una orden ejecutiva que exigía el desmantelamiento del Departamento de Educación. Los sindicatos de docentes presentaron rápidamente una demanda para bloquear la orden, y los miembros de la delegación del Congreso de Connecticut se han comprometido a tomar medidas. Trump ha declarado que la administración de los préstamos estudiantiles se transferiría a la Administración de Pequeñas Empresas (SBA) y que los programas de necesidades especiales se transferirían al Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos (HHS).
Financiación en la era del COVID-19
El año pasado, los distritos escolares de todo el país solicitaron prórrogas para gastar los últimos dólares restantes de la ayuda federal para el COVID-19 antes de marzo de 2026, en lugar de la fecha límite original de enero de 2025. Sin embargo, a finales de marzo, la administración Trump congeló dicha financiación.
Los últimos 14 millones de dólares de Connecticut se destinaron principalmente a programas del Departamento de Educación Estatal, y poco más de 6 millones de dólares de los fondos ya se habían otorgado a aproximadamente dos docenas de distritos escolares de primaria y secundaria. Se esperaba que New London y Waterbury recibieran la mayor parte de esos fondos.
El gobierno también ha declarado su intención de recortar la financiación de las escuelas y universidades que exigen la vacunación contra el COVID-19.
Estudiantes transgénero
Durante su primera semana en el cargo, el presidente Trump emitió una orden que ponía fin a las protecciones del Título IX para estudiantes transgénero. La semana siguiente, el Departamento de Educación acató la orden, derogando las normas establecidas durante el gobierno de Biden. Posteriormente, el gobierno de Trump emitió una orden ejecutiva que prohíbe a las mujeres y niñas transgénero competir en deportes femeninos. Las instituciones que no cumplan con la prohibición podrían ver recortada su financiación, según ha declarado el gobierno.
A finales de marzo, el departamento envió una carta a los estados amenazando con retener la financiación federal si no se permitía a los padres revisar los expedientes estudiantiles, en particular los relacionados con la identidad de género del estudiante. En Connecticut, defensores de la educación buscan mayor protección para los estudiantes transgénero tras las medidas de la administración Trump.
Control migratorio
En enero, el presidente anunció que los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) y la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) podrían realizar arrestos en escuelas, iglesias y hospitales, lugares que durante mucho tiempo se habían considerado “sitios sensibles” y a los que se les había prohibido el acceso a las autoridades migratorias.
Las autoridades educativas de Connecticut publicaron una guía para las escuelas públicas, desde Preescolar hasta el último año del Secundario, sobre cómo los líderes de los distritos locales deben responder a las “actividades migratorias”, incluyendo los casos en que los funcionarios federales de inmigración soliciten información estudiantil o ingresen a las instalaciones escolares.
Comidas escolares
Se cancelaron millones de dólares en fondos previstos que las escuelas y los bancos de alimentos de Connecticut planeaban utilizar para comprar alimentos frescos a agricultores locales. El Departamento de Agricultura de EE.UU. informó a las agencias estatales que dejaría de operar los dos programas que gastan mil millones de dólares anuales a nivel nacional: el Programa de Acuerdo Cooperativo de Asistencia para la Compra de Alimentos Locales y el programa de Alimentos Locales para las Escuelas.
Protestas en los campus universitarios
A finales de enero, el presidente se comprometió a cancelar las visas de estudiante de “todos los simpatizantes de Hamas en los campus universitarios”. Semanas después, el Departamento de Educación advirtió a 60 universidades que podrían enfrentar repercusiones si no “protegen a los estudiantes judíos en sus campus”. La Universidad de Yale se encontraba entre las instituciones mencionadas en el anuncio del Departamento. Varios estudiantes internacionales que participaron en las protestas han sido detenidos.

TUSCALOOSA — When Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum visited two Warrior Met coal mines in central Alabama last week, he said he was emphasizing the administration’s commitment to “clean, beautiful coal” and its plans to roll back regulation.
The department’s press office swiftly posted on social media after the trip his ultimate goal: “Mine, Baby, Mine!”
What Burgum didn’t mention on Friday was Warrior Met Coal’s checkered safety and environmental record, which includes thousands of federal safety violations issued under both Republican and Democratic administrations. He also didn’t mention the death of Aaron Haley, a 34-year-old miner killed on the job in 2023 because, according to an investigative report by federal safety officials, Warrior Met did not keep equipment in safe operating condition.

Missing, too, from Burgum’s comments was any recognition that the coal produced by Warrior Met, metallurgical coal, is not used to power American homes or businesses. Instead, it is shipped abroad through the Port of Mobile, largely to countries in South America and Asia for steelmaking.
“Through these tours, Secretary Burgum is displaying the importance of President Trump’s executive orders which are Unleashing American Energy and putting hardworking Americans first,” a press release from Burgum’s office said after the trip. “Friday’s visit highlights the Department of the Interior’s continued focus on bolstering domestic coal production to create more jobs, lower the cost of living for Americans, and unlock more of our nation’s critical resources.”
Neither Inside Climate News nor other local news outlets contacted by ICN were notified of Burgum’s visit ahead of time. A national reporter for Fox Business was on site for the trip with access to the cabinet secretary.
The Department of the Interior has not responded to questions about the trip or why local reporters were not included. It did not address Warrior Met’s safety or environmental record. Warrior Met has not responded to questions about Burgum’s visit or its own environmental and safety record.
  Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum visited two Alabama mines in April. (Department of the Interior)
According to the department, Burgum’s first stop was Warrior Met Mine No. 4. The mine utilizes the longwall method of extraction where coal is sheared by large high-powered machinery, leaving behind vast open expanses underground that can lead to the permanent sinking of the land above. The method is faster and can be riskier than other forms of mining and has been blamed for methane leaks.
In March 2024, an Alabama grandfather was killed by an explosion in his home above Oak Grove mine, a longwall operation in nearby Jefferson County, after methane gas likely leaked into the home,
This month, just days before President Donald Trump boasted from the White House about “unleashing…clean, beautiful coal,” a West Virginia woman was severely injured from a blast at her home above a longwall mine.
On April 5, she lit a cigarette, setting off an explosion that first responders suspect was caused by a methane leak from the mine, owned by Core Natural Resources, a Pennsylvania company created by the merger in January of CONSOL Energy and Arch Resources. An investigation is continuing by state inspectors who have ordered the company to submit a revised permit for monitoring methane emissions.
Coal helped turn the United States into a global economic and military power, but coal-fired power plants emit toxic air pollution and heat-trapping gases that are changing the world’s climate in dangerous ways. Moreover, the methane that coal mining releases is a super-pollutant 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at warming the planet over a 20-year period. Inside mines, methane also presents deadly explosion risks to miners if safety measures are not followed.
Contrary to Trump and Burgum’s clean coal assertions, coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels.
Warrior Met’s No. 4 mine has had a history of safety violations, according to records maintained by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the federal regulator charged with ensuring miner wellbeing.
Since 2019, the mine has been cited by federal regulators nearly 3,000 times with safety violations. About 25 percent—731 of those violations—were labelled by MSHA as “significant and substantial,” meaning the violations were “reasonably likely to result in a serious injury or illness.” More than 100 citations have been issued since Trump took office.
﻿
Records show that the No. 4 Mine is currently undergoing two spot inspections and a “regular safety and health inspection,” investigations that have resulted so far in 25 citations. The mine’s previous complete safety and health inspection, conducted in January, February and March, resulted in 78 citations, according to regulatory records.
Less than two years ago, Aaron Haley, a West Virginia native and father of three, was killed while working inside the No. 4 Mine. An MSHA investigation into the incident faulted the mine for his death and injuries suffered by two other miners.
“On August 30, 2023, at approximately 6:50 a.m., Aaron Haley, a 34-year-old belt foreman with over 13 years of mining experience, died when a longwall belt conveyor take-up unit (take-up) component, the bridle, broke and struck him,” the report said. “The accident occurred because the mine operator did not maintain components of the take-up in safe operating condition.”
Haley’s obituary offers a more expansive sense of what was lost that day: “Aaron was kind, loving, generous, funny and would give the shirt off his back to anyone. He loved teaching [his son] baseball, football, fishing, and just ‘guy’ stuff. His two baby girls…had him wrapped around their fingers. He loved playing kitchen, restaurant and pushing them on their swings. Aaron loved his wife…dearly and took the best care of her. He was the absolute best husband, father, son, and an all-around wonderful man.”
MSHA cited Warrior Met with a violation of 30 CFR 75.1725(a), a regulation requiring that equipment “be maintained in safe operating condition.” If machinery is deemed unsafe, the regulation requires it be removed from service immediately. Since Haley’s death, the No. 4 Mine has been cited nearly 39 times for violating the same safety requirement.
Burgum’s visit to the No. 4 mine was followed, according to his department’s press release, by a “windshield tour” of Warrior Met’s planned Blue Creek facility, which is slated to be one of the largest coal mining expansions in the state’s history.

If approved by state and federal regulators, the project is expected to increase Warrior Met’s coal production by up to 60 percent. Taxpayer-funded support for the facility may top $400 million.
Warrior Met’s planned expansion at Blue Creek may also include the extraction of publicly-owned coal managed by the Bureau of Land Management, according to federal documents.
In Alabama, as in many other states, so-called “mineral rights”—including the right to mine for coal under property—have been separated from surface ownership over time. One person or entity can own a surface property under Alabama law while another person or entity can own the rights to all of the resources below that same piece of land, a situation known as a “split estate.” In significant areas of Alabama, the federal government retains mineral rights despite private land ownership on the surface.
The federal Bureau of Land Management announced in April that it would conduct an environmental assessment related to Warrior Met’s Blue Creek project and, specifically, its proposal to mine 14,040 acres of federal minerals underlying privately owned land in Tuscaloosa County. Warrior Met’s applications to lease the coal rights propose the extraction of approximately 57.5 million tons of recoverable public coal reserves.
Taxpayers will help to pay for some critical needs related to the expansion of the Blue Creek project, according to state and county officials who touted the expansion as leading to job creation. In March 2024, Gov. Kay Ivey announced that, with the support of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, the Appalachian Regional Commission would provide $500,000 in taxpayer funding to install public water service to the Blue Creek mine site. “Access to dependable local water service is essential to attract and grow new business and jobs,” Ivey said.

Warrior Met also secured a $26.5 million tax abatement from the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority. A breakdown of the tax incentive deal in 2020 estimated that Warrior Met would receive $18 million in tax breaks during the project’s construction and $8.5 million over the next decade.
“This project represents a significant investment in our community by Warrior Met Coal,” said Mark Crews, chairman of the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority, “but also represents valuable job opportunities for our citizens for several decades to come.”
Exports from Warrior Met and other Alabama coal producers are also a driving force behind continued expansion at the Port of Mobile, including the publicly-funded dredging of Mobile Bay, which is slated to cost taxpayers more than $350 million.
Warrior Met has been the target of litigation over its environmental record. In September 2024, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, an environmental group founded to protect and restore the Black Warrior River and its tributaries, settled a lawsuit with the company over a leaking coal slurry impoundment at Warrior Met’s No. 7 Mine in Brookwood. Black Warrior Riverkeeper had documented nearly two dozen leaks from the coal waste pond in the year before the suit was filed, the organization said in a court filing earlier this year.
The settlement, approved by a federal judge in September of last year, requires Warrior Met to limit and monitor leaks from the site, pay $250,000 to the Freshwater Land Trust for a conservation project and reimburse the nonprofit for its legal fees.
Burgum said last week that metallurgical coal like that extracted by Warrior Met is “essential for us for steelmaking,” though the company itself has acknowledged its coal is not used for steelmaking in the United States. “Substantially all of our steelmaking coal sales are exported,” the company wrote in its 2024 annual report to shareholders.
In the same report, Warrior Met outlined various risks and uncertainties that could impact their bottom line. Among them: “Challenges associated with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations” and “climate change concerns and our operations’ impact on the environment.”

(Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Wyandotte County District Court judge pointed to flaws in Kansas’ capital punishment law in an opinion that didn’t lead to findings relative to a constitutional challenge because the death penalty was taken off the table in both cases creating legal standing for the case.
Judge Bill Klapper’s opinion delved into economic, fairness and psychological elements of capital punishment and examined claims the death penalty statute was biased against defendants of color, fostered trauma among families of victims who dealt with years of proceedings and promoted expenditure of millions of dollars by prosecutors pursuing a sentence the state hadn’t enforced in 60 years.
The constitutional challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations came to an end once their clients accused of capital crimes no longer faced the ultimate punishment.
“The impossibility of either defendant being subjected to the death penalty causes them to lose their legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Kansas death penalty as applied to them,” Klapper’s order said.
The ACLU, ACLU of Kansas, the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, Democracy Forward and lawyers from Washington, D.C., law firms filed motions challenging the death penalty on behalf of Antoine Fielder, who was accused of shooting to death Wyandotte County Deputies Theresa King and Patrick Rohrer in June 2018 while being escorted to a court hearing. In exchange for prosecutors withdrawing a request for the death penalty, Fielder entered in December a plea of guilty to two counts of capital murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
The second participant in the constitutional challenge was Hugo Villaneuva-Morales, who was accused of killing four people in October 2019 at a bar in Kansas City, Kansas. In February, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against Villaneuva-Morales in exchange for his waiver of the right to a jury trial. He was found guilty of murder on Wednesday.
Because both men no longer faced the potential of execution, the district court judge didn’t rule on broad constitutional claims relative to the case. With addition of Fielder and Villaneuva-Morales, the ACLU has represented four clients in legal challenges to the state’s death penalty.
“The evidentiary hearings have consistently exposed uncomfortable truths to state prosecutors, the courts and the public about the deep flaws and injustices embedded in the death penalty system,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the ACLU’s Capital Punishment Project.
On Thursday, Stubbs said judicial issues brought to light in the series of legal challenges should be recognized by lawmakers in Kansas.
“We remain committed to challenging the death penalty on behalf of people facing capital charges in Kansas with the hope that state legislators will end the death penalty and make future legal challenges unnecessary,” she said.
 
The evidence
In Wyandotte County District Court, testimony portrayed capital punishment as unconstitutional in terms of the right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of equal protection rights associated with race and gender. The legal coalition challenging Kansas’ death penalty law additionally asserted jury selection in capital cases, in which all jurors must be willing to impose a death sentence, was unconstitutional.
Witnesses called on behalf of Fielder and Villaneuva-Morales argued the automatic striking of prospective jurors who didn’t believe execution to be a valid form of punishment was discriminatory against Black people, women and individuals with firmly held religious beliefs.
Klapper’s 15-page opinion summarized evidence offered by half the 13 expert witnesses called by attorneys for the two men accused of murder. The state cross-examined most of those witnesses, but didn’t present testimony. The judge said evidence presented on behalf of the two defendants “was decidedly persuasive and well-reasoned.”
He portrayed race and gender as key elements in how prosecutors decided to pursue the death penalty and how those cases were handled by juries. In Kansas, none of 15 men sentenced to death killed a Black person despite Black males making up more than 30% of homicide victims. White females comprised 20% of homicide victims in Kansas, but cases with white female victims were most likely to lead to a death sentence.
“The factors which distinguish death sentence cases from non-death sentence cases are the race and gender of the victim, and the race and gender of the defendant,” the judge’s opinion said.
Klapper drew from an expert witness for the two men who argued the legal framework for selecting jurors was “so flawed that it does not protect racial biases in jury selection and must be reformed, a fact known to Kansans for years.”
The judge wrote that testimony indicated the “scientific community has found no reliable evidence of the death penalty being a deterrent to homicides.”
 
‘Painful wounds’
Hearings in the case, which began in October, showed Kansas prosecutors had filed 129 capital murder cases in response to more than 4,000 homicides committed in the state since the state restored the death penalty in 1994. Prosecutors took the next step to provide formal notice the death penalty would be sought in 76 of those cases.
Of 15 men sentenced to death in Kansas, nine remained under sentences of death. Four of them were resentenced to long prison terms, while two died in prison.
“Much more difficult to measure, but most concerning is the impact continual court hearings have on the victims’ families,” Klapper wrote. “The verdict in a capital case resulting in a death sentence is not the end but only the beginning of the appellate process. Most of the Kansas death penalty cases have been pending for more than 15 years and no (inmate) has exhausted their appellate rights.
“How will families of the victims ever begin to heal and attempt the process of recovery, if that is even possible, when the legal system continues to reopen those painful wounds with each new motion?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9082-scaled-e1730240913469-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917
,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-04-17 15:48:20+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Federal cuts threaten to close Pennsylvania lab that certifies N95s and other respirators in June,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/federal-cuts-threaten-to-close-pennsylvania-lab-that-certifies-n95s-and-other-respirators-in-june/,The lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June. That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.,"Aerial shot of the NIOSH campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County. (Photo from the CDC)Most Americans learned what an N95 mask was during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Allegheny County. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”

Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June. 
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
‘Someone will have to own the travesty’
Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.










One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. It’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public. 


“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.

For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1. 
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June. 
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return. 
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

Jaydun was the second of five brothers and had a baby sister. He was very close to his siblings, those who knew him said, and a close friend to many kids in foster care.
“He was always building us up, like helping us all,” said Jacie, a friend of Jaydun’s who lived with him for months in the Albuquerque office building of the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, where case workers have often housed kids who don’t have foster homes available to them.

“Hearing that he’s gone, it just like broke us, and it took a piece out of us,” she said. Jaydun and Jacie both belonged to a tight-knit group of foster youth — teens who had spent much of their lives in foster care and had spent years held in group facilities. Jaydun loved to draw and was an athletic kid who loved basketball, especially the Los Angeles Lakers — a person whom friends would seek out when they needed someone to talk to.
For this story, Searchlight spoke to six people with direct knowledge of the circumstances of Jaydun’s death. Most of them asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media, or because of sensitivities related to the case.

“He was always building us up, like helping us all,” said Jacie, a friend of Jaydun’s. “Hearing that he’s gone, it just like broke us, and it took a piece out of us.”

In an email, CYFD communications director Andrew Skobinsky wrote that the department could not comment because of confidentiality laws. “We are only authorized to release information when it is determined that abuse or neglect caused a child’s death,” he wrote. “Accordingly, no further information can be provided.”
Jaydun’s death comes after years of promises by CYFD to stop housing its foster youth in group settings and to provide them adequate mental health care — promises that were made as part of the 2020 settlement of a class action lawsuit that claimed the state’s child welfare system was “locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental and behavioral health.”
Now, half a decade later, CYFD has failed year after year to meet its commitments to those promises, according to independent monitors.
Instead, it has housed children with serious mental and behavioral health needs in youth homeless shelters and its office buildings, where they have been sexually assaulted, injured by armed guards and exposed to fentanyl and other drugs.
“When I go visit a client who is living in these settings, I see their mental health declining sharply,” said Sara Crecca, an Albuquerque-based youth attorney who was co-counsel for the plaintiffs of the class action suit.
Amid mounting criticism from attorneys, legislators and advocates, CYFD in June 2024 began moving youth from its office complex to a new building: a former Albuquerque halfway house built for girls transitioning out of juvenile detention.
It was in that building that Jaydun died last weekend, discovered in the bathroom by his roommate, another teenage boy.
The death in itself is beyond tragic, friends and attorneys say — a loss made all the more painful by the fact that CYFD had continued to house Jaydun and other youth in congregate care despite barrages of warnings that such housing was a “clear and urgent safety risk for children,” particularly those who were suffering mental crises, with staffing shortages sometimes leaving kids with nowhere to turn.
“They’re supposed to be the one people that we trust, the ones that we go to when we have problems,” Jacie said of CYFD. In the wake of Jaydun’s death, nobody from the department had reached out to Jacie to offer therapy or counseling, she said.
“If they really cared, they would be on top of getting us therapy. They would be on top of us having a home — a forever home, an actual home with parents’ love — not removing us, not putting us in shelters, not putting us in the office. We’re not getting that.”
Still, the events of last weekend felt unexpected to those close to Jaydun.
“CYFD had promised him a lot of support” during the last year, a close acquaintance of his told Searchlight, asking that they not be named because of the sensitive nature of the case. “He seemed to be optimistic about his future.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYFD2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told a crowd gathered in a Denver high school auditorium Wednesday night that opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration are fighting “to keep America, America.”
Weiser welcomed three of his counterparts from other states — Attorneys General Nick Brown of Washington, Anne Lopez of Hawaii and Aaron Ford of Nevada — for the latest in a series of “community impact hearings” on Trump’s agenda at George Washington High School.
The four are among the 23 elected Democratic attorneys general nationwide who have led the fight against the second Trump administration’s agenda in the courts. Weiser has sued Trump at least a dozen times so far, including challenges to the administration’s attempt to end the 14th Amendment’s protections for birthright citizenship; its sweeping freeze of many federal grant and aid programs; its mass layoffs of federal employees; and its defunding of medical research through the National Institutes of Health.
Weiser said the legal challenges have borne some fruit in the form of preliminary injunctions and other procedural victories, but acknowledged growing alarm over whether “this democratic republic (will) hold.”
“These court victories are important, but more important is everyone’s voice,” Weiser said, encouraging the crowd to join protests like the one that drew 8,000 people to the Colorado Capitol on April 5. “We need to use our voice.”
Wednesday’s event came amid an outcry this week over the fates of more than 200 immigrants deported by the Trump administration to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and promises by Trump to send American citizens there next. At least one of the deportees, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members of many others say that they were falsely identified as members of a transnational gang because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
The administration has also moved to target hundreds of lawful permanent residents and student visa holders for deportation, including Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations at Columbia University, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student who was detained after writing an op-ed in her student newspaper. Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado woman without legal status who was detained by federal authorities last month, have also alleged in court that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra for her immigration advocacy work.
“We won’t tolerate people being picked up without any process and shipped to some other country with no recourse,” Weiser told the crowd to applause. “The First Amendment matters, because when you speak, and you speak your truth, you cannot be — in this country — retaliated against for speaking your truth.”
Weiser, serving his second term as attorney general after winning reelection in 2022, is running for Colorado governor in 2026. He faces a tough primary contest against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who entered the race last week.
 Constitutional crisis?

Weiser and his fellow attorneys general heard stories from Coloradans personally impacted by the Trump administration’s actions, including federal workers, homelessness service providers and refugee support organizations.
Marya Washburn, a U.S. Forest Service employee, was part of a firefighting team that responded to the Alexander Mountain Fire in Colorado last summer. In February, she was among the 3,400 probationary employees at the agency to receive termination notices from the Trump administration, and although she was reinstated thanks to a court order, that order is set to end on Saturday.
“I’m shaking,” Washburn said as she read from her notes, citing concerns about cuts to firefighting personnel ahead of the 2025 fire season. “I’m angry.”
Trump’s mass layoffs, funding freezes and attempted shutdowns of congressionally-established agencies amount to an unprecedented expansion of executive power that runs contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution. Fears that his administration will defy adverse court rulings have also reached new heights in recent days, especially following its apparent inaction in the face of a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling last week stating the administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.
Brown, elected as Washington attorney general last year, said that the outcomes of some legal challenges to the administration — like the restoration of grant funding that Trump had attempted to freeze — had “for the most part” given him “confidence in our system.” But that confidence is now being tested.
“This is the first time — this week, in the days past — where I think we’re really getting to the precipice of a constitutional crisis,” he said. “And I don’t say that lightly.”
“I don’t have all the answers. I do not know what it means for a president to blatantly disregard what a court says. I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” Brown continued. “But we might be there tomorrow, or next week.”

On a positive note, North Carolina recently expanded Medicaid to provide health insurance coverage to over 600,000 working people within our state. These individuals would otherwise fall short of the income threshold for “regular” Medicaid but surpass the affordability of private health insurance.
However, the situation is dire as Congress has placed the health care of these families and numerous others in North Carolina at risk of being cut. The U.S. House of Representatives has set a target of reducing $880 billion from Medicaid, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for the healthcare system and jeopardizing the well-being of patients and communities in North Carolina.
As obstetricians and gynecologists, we are deeply concerned about the potentially devastating impact these cuts would have on our patients. Many of them rely on Medicaid for their healthcare needs. These are the individuals and families who have only recently gained access to health insurance through North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion. For many, it marks their first time having health insurance in years.
Medicaid provides more than just appointments; it covers essential medications, vaccinations, prenatal ultrasounds, hospital stays, and surgeries. Without Medicaid, these patients would be unable to receive the necessary care to maintain their health, work, and care for their families.
It is undeniable that losing health insurance does not guarantee immunity from illness. It simply means that individuals without coverage cannot access the assistance they require when they are unwell. For individuals with diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, high blood pressure, or other health conditions, delaying care often results in more severe health complications. This can lead to emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and more costly medical treatments.











No one should have to fear losing their job, home, or even a loved one due to a single illness, all because they lack health insurance.



The patients we encounter who are covered under Medicaid expansion are working diligently to maintain their health, care for their children, and advance their lives. However, they cannot achieve these goals without access to health insurance. Therefore, Medicaid expansion holds immense significance.
No one should have to fear losing their job, home, or even a loved one due to a single illness, all because they lack health insurance. Regrettably, this scenario would unfold if we reverse our progress in Medicaid expansion at the state level.
Cutting Medicaid would have a particularly severe impact on women of childbearing age, many of whom rely on Medicaid coverage to meet their health needs. In fact, nearly half of all births in our state are now covered by Medicaid. North Carolina’s recent Medicaid expansion legislation provided healthcare for many women of childbearing age before they became pregnant. Healthy mothers give birth to healthy babies, so eliminating or reducing Medicaid coverage for these women before they conceive will result in an increase in high-risk births, babies with serious health complications, and subsequently higher medical costs.
Instead of resorting to emergency rooms, we want our patients to have consistent access to healthcare. Removing this coverage from the thousands of women will lead to a perilous rise in preventable health complications and deaths not only in North Carolina but also across the nation.
While Congress deliberates on these cuts, one thing is certain: if Medicaid is cut, not only will women and their families bear the brunt of the consequences, but so will North Carolina. It is not too late for us to collectively raise our voices in support of Medicaid and oppose these steep cuts. We urge our elected officials to push back against these proposed cuts. The lives of our fellow North Carolinians, including many mothers and babies, depend on it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pregnant-with-IV-Getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

It now goes to the House, where GOP leaders are expected to craft a largely separate budget and come to a compromise later.
The plan outlines $32.6 billion in spending for fiscal year 2025-26 and $33.3 billion for 2026-27. It gives modest pay raises to state workers, educators and law enforcement; cuts hundreds of vacant state jobs and some filled ones; and sets aside hundreds of millions for future hurricane relief.
Conservatives in the chamber have praised the spending plan as a safe but confident step in continuing North Carolina’s growth.
“It’s not probably the budget everybody wanted, but it is a good, sound, fiscally responsible budget,” Sen. Brent Jackson (R-Sampson) said Thursday.
Democrats have criticized the budget for lacking extensive investment in key areas, arguing that it fails to put the state and its residents on safe economic ground. And they continued to express frustration about a largely opaque budget process.

“Perhaps invite us to the table next time, and we could talk to you about some of the amendments we have,” Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) told reporters Wednesday evening. “Because you don’t have the corner on the market to good ideas, especially when it comes to North Carolina.”
Batch said Democrats were open to working with any House Republicans who welcomed their input.
The final vote in the Senate on Thursday was 30-15. Sen. Bobby Hanig (R-Currituck), who had an amendment shot down by his Republican colleagues Wednesday, joined Democrats in opposition. Four Democrats, including former Senate Democratic Leader Dan Blue (D-Wake) voted yes.
House budget writers are expected to craft their own plan that differs significantly from the Senate’s. Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Wednesday evening he had only had discussions with Speaker Destin Hall about top-level spending.

CHICAGO — Red-light camera entrepreneur Omar Maani made a point of not saying much during an April 2019 meeting with state Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, letting his co-founder and lobbyists for his company SafeSpeed do most of the talking.

But as they dined at a suburban steakhouse two months later, Maani told Jones that he didn’t say “a f------ word the whole time” at their previous meeting because he preferred to discuss business “one-on-one or with an intimate group.”

He then proceeded to talk so much, Jones left the dinner feeling like he’d spent his evening with “a used-car salesman,” the senator told a jury Wednesday as he testified in his own defense at his federal corruption trial.

“He just — he talked a lot,” Jones said after his attorney, Vic Henderson, asked what the senator meant. “He repeated himself over and over again and ... I don’t know, just like I said, he reminded me of a used-car salesman.”

But instead of a clunker, Maani was trying to sell Jones on the idea of changing legislation he’d introduced in Springfield that called for a statewide study on red-light camera systems. The senator had sponsored a few similar bills in the past, and though they hadn’t gotten close to becoming law, Maani was worried that a study would eventually lead to a ban on the technology, threatening his business.

A few months after that June 2019 dinner, Jones told FBI agents he’d felt uncomfortable as Maani and his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, hinted at benefits Sandoval received from Maani.

As it turned out, Sandoval received approximately $75,000 in cash from Maani — but only because Maani was cooperating with the FBI, which provided him with the money. As the trio ate their meals, Maani had the latest installment sitting in his jacket pocket.

But Jones didn’t know that yet. When Sandoval turned to Jones during their dinner and told him that Maani “wants to be your friend,” though, he started getting the picture.

“So what did you think he meant by, ‘He wants you to be his friend?’” FBI Special Agent Nijika Rustagi asked Jones as she and her partner interviewed him in his home on Sept. 24, 2019.

“Well, two things,” the senator answered. “One, you know, he wants to donate to my campaign, or two, he wants to, you know, give me cash.”

‘That’s why I never called him back’

Jones didn’t make any specific promises at the dinner, but did repeat what he’d said when he visited SafeSpeed’s offices in April: he’d been hearing fewer complaints about red-light cameras from his constituents lately, and believed that Chicago’s red-light camera program was more of a problem than systems in the suburbs, where SafeSpeed operated.

The senator was willing to limit his legislation to only study red-light cameras in Chicago, but he still wanted a statewide look at the systems. And though he was wary of both Maani and Sandoval, Jones said he believed he had to work with them to get his bill passed by negotiating something they all could live with, he testified Wednesday.

When Jones and Maani met for another dinner the following month, Maani cut to the chase.

“So let me ask you this: In an ideal world, how much would you want me to come up with or raise or what have you for it?” Maani asked of Jones’ upcoming fundraiser.  “You tell me a number.”

“I don’t give folks numbers,” Jones said after a beat. “Just whatever you can raise for me, that’d be nice. I’m not greedy.”

But Maani pressed him, telling the senator he wanted to “meet expectations.” Eventually, between bites of wagyu steak, Jones acquiesced.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Prosecutors pinpointed this moment in Maani’s secretly recorded footage of his and Jones’ July 17, 2019, dinner as the instant Jones named his price for a bribe to change his legislation — the basis for two of the charges the senator is fighting in court.

The third count alleges Jones lied to the FBI about the purported bribes on another secret recording played for the jury Tuesday. When the agents arrived at Jones’ home on Chicago’s far South Side on that September morning, they told him they were investigating Sandoval, which was true; a host of other federal agents would execute search warrants on the senator’s offices and home later that day.

(Capitol News Illinois file photo)[/caption]

But they didn’t tell Jones that he was also under investigation.

During the interview, FBI Special Agent Timothy O’Brien asked Jones whether Maani directly propositioned him for a bribe.

“Did Omar say like, ‘Hey, you know, what’s it gonna take?’” O’Brien asked. “Did you guys come up with an amount that he was going to donate for a fundraiser or anything like that?”

“No, no, no,” Jones answered. “He just asked, ‘How much do you want me to raise?’ I said, “Whatever you want to raise. Whatever you can do, you know?’”

From the witness stand Wednesday — more than 5 ½ years later — the senator explained why he told the agents that he and Maani hadn’t come up with a number.

“Because we didn’t,” Jones said. “When I said to him, ‘You can raise me five grand,’ that’s anywhere between zero and five thousand.”

After Jones denied settling on a number with Maani, the agents told him they knew he suggested $5,000 to Maani and they knew “about those conversations you had with Sandoval about how much.” Jones’ former colleague began cooperating with the government and pleaded guilty to bribery and tax fraud but can’t be called for testimony in Jones’ trial because he died in late 2020.

While the money never materialized and Jones never ended up amending his legislation according to Maani’s wishes, prosecutors say that doesn’t matter. The senator’s former intern, then-23-year-old Christopher Katz, did end up getting paid by Maani for a six-week period before the FBI’s red-light camera probe went public with their raids the same day O’Brien and Rustagi showed up to Jones’ house.

Jones acknowledged to the agents that he knew Maani was suggesting something illegal when he repeatedly told the senator that he’d like to come up with a “creative” way to contribute the $5,000 but emphasized that he was never going to accept money from Maani.

“That’s why I never called him back,” the senator told the agents.

“But yet he hired your intern, which could be construed that he’s helping you out,” O’Brien said.

“Could it?” Jones asked. “I mean, I do that all the time. You know, recommend people who are asking for jobs.”

On Wednesday, the senator explained that he’d answered O’Brien’s question with another question “because I didn’t look at it that way — as him (Maani) hiring my intern as a benefit to me.”

‘My only concern was getting him a job’

A little later in the FBI interview, Jones acknowledged that Maani told him the previous month that he’d put Katz on his payroll even though he didn’t have any work for him to do. He thought Maani had essentially hired Katz “as his personal assistant.”

“Because you asked him to,” Rustagi said.

“Yeah, but not in exchange for — ” Jones replied before Rustagi cut him off, telling the senator that she knew what he and Maani talked about at their July dinner at Steak 48, Jones’ favorite Chicago steakhouse.

On Wednesday, Jones tried to explain that moment in hindsight.

“It seemed like she was trying to accuse me of hiring my intern in exchange for changing legislation,” Jones said, adding that the notion was “definitely untrue.”

“Me asking for employment (for Katz) had nothing to do with the legislation,” he said.

The senator explained that as he was making his way to the dinner with Maani, Katz’s mother “called me crying.”

“She really, really needed him to have a job — is there anything I can do to help facilitate him getting a job?” Jones recalled.

Katz had previously worked two different stints in the senator’s district office, but in the summer of 2019, Jones said he didn’t have room in his budget to hire another intern.

But he remembered that on his April visit to SafeSpeed’s headquarters, he learned the company hired dozens of college students to review red-light camera footage to determine whether a violation occurred and should be sent to the local police chief of the camera’s host municipality for final approval and ticketing.

Jones believed it would be a ""good fit” for Katz, and at first Maani agreed. But during another dinner in August 2019, Maani told him that he had reservations about recommending SafeSpeed hire someone connected with Jones.

In testimony last week, Maani told the jury he believed it would have looked “really goofy and concerning that we’re now hiring his intern with someone who’s sponsoring negative legislation against us.”

Instead, Maani told Jones at their second Steak 48 dinner that he’d hire Katz to “work directly for me.”

On Wednesday, Jones said it was “none of my business” that Maani wanted to keep Katz’s job a secret from his colleagues.

“My only concern was getting him a job,” Jones said.

Prosecutors last week showed the jury a series of text messages between Jones and Katz in the summer of 2019, which included Katz requesting spending money from Jones and late-night messages from the much-older senator.

“I want to see u after,” Jones texted Katz at 2:17 a.m. after Katz told Jones he was still at a now-defunct strip club in south suburban Harvey, though the two never met up that night.

“And these text messages — tell us about your relationship with Chris,” Henderson directed his client Wednesday. “Put it out there.”

“We’re friends,” Jones said of Katz, though he said they don’t talk all the time. He confirmed that they’d been introduced by Katz’s mother, Linda Redd, who testified the same on Tuesday and lives with her son.

“Me and Chris share a passion for cooking,” Jones said. “I get invited over to their house every once in a while.”

Jones’ testimony differed slightly from Katz, who said on the witness stand last week he didn’t consider Jones a friend. And it differed a bit from testimony given by Redd, who said she’d only seen Jones in person “maybe four” times — mostly at parties where they’d dance together to house music, an electronic dance genre born in 1980s Chicago.

On the night of the extended text exchange with Katz, Jones said he and his former intern had run into each other at the Chosen Few Picnic, an annual all-day house music festival on Chicago’s South Side.

“You can dance?” Henderson asked his client.

“I can do a little something,” Jones replied, garnering a smattering of laughter from the courtroom.

The senator will continue his testimony for a third day on Thursday, likely followed by what prosecutors estimate will be at least a few hours of cross-examination.

A little later in the FBI interview, Jones acknowledged that Maani told him the previous month that he’d put Katz on his payroll even though he didn’t have any work for him to do. He thought Maani had essentially hired Katz “as his personal assistant.”

“Because you asked him to,” Rustagi said.

“Yeah, but not in exchange for — ” Jones replied before Rustagi cut him off, telling the senator that she knew what he and Maani talked about at their July dinner at Steak 48, Jones’ favorite Chicago steakhouse.

On Wednesday, Jones tried to explain that moment in hindsight.

“It seemed like she was trying to accuse me of hiring my intern in exchange for changing legislation,” Jones said, adding that the notion was “definitely untrue.”

“Me asking for employment (for Katz) had nothing to do with the legislation,” he said.

The senator explained that as he was making his way to the dinner with Maani, Katz’s mother “called me crying.”

“She really, really needed him to have a job — is there anything I can do to help facilitate him getting a job?” Jones recalled.

Katz had previously worked two different stints in the senator’s district office, but in the summer of 2019, Jones said he didn’t have room in his budget to hire another intern.

But he remembered that on his April visit to SafeSpeed’s headquarters, he learned the company hired dozens of college students to review red-light camera footage to determine whether a violation occurred and should be sent to the local police chief of the camera’s host municipality for final approval and ticketing.

Jones believed it would be a ""good fit” for Katz, and at first Maani agreed. But during another dinner in August 2019, Maani told him that he had reservations about recommending SafeSpeed hire someone connected with Jones.

In testimony last week, Maani told the jury he believed it would have looked “really goofy and concerning that we’re now hiring his intern with someone who’s sponsoring negative legislation against us.”

Instead, Maani told Jones at their second Steak 48 dinner that he’d hire Katz to “work directly for me.”

On Wednesday, Jones said it was “none of my business” that Maani wanted to keep Katz’s job a secret from his colleagues.

“My only concern was getting him a job,” Jones said.

Prosecutors last week showed the jury a series of text messages between Jones and Katz in the summer of 2019, which included Katz requesting spending money from Jones and late-night messages from the much-older senator.

“I want to see u after,” Jones texted Katz at 2:17 a.m. after Katz told Jones he was still at a now-defunct strip club in south suburban Harvey, though the two never met up that night.

“And these text messages — tell us about your relationship with Chris,” Henderson directed his client Wednesday. “Put it out there.”

“We’re friends,” Jones said of Katz, though he said they don’t talk all the time. He confirmed that they’d been introduced by Katz’s mother, Linda Redd, who testified the same on Tuesday and lives with her son.

“Me and Chris share a passion for cooking,” Jones said. “I get invited over to their house every once in a while.”

Jones’ testimony differed slightly from Katz, who said on the witness stand last week he didn’t consider Jones a friend. And it differed a bit from testimony given by Redd, who said she’d only seen Jones in person “maybe four” times — mostly at parties where they’d dance together to house music, an electronic dance genre born in 1980s Chicago.

On the night of the extended text exchange with Katz, Jones said he and his former intern had run into each other at the Chosen Few Picnic, an annual all-day house music festival on Chicago’s South Side.

“You can dance?” Henderson asked his client.

“I can do a little something,” Jones replied, garnering a smattering of laughter from the courtroom.

The senator will continue his testimony for a third day on Thursday, likely followed by what prosecutors estimate will be at least a few hours of cross-examination.

(Screenshot from Fort Benning livestream)Fort Benning’s name has officially been restored after a two-year stint as Fort Moore that was part of a national move away from Confederate namesakes.
But the Pentagon says the Army post near the Alabama border is now named for a different Benning – World War I veteran Fred Benning of Nebraska, an Army corporal who enlisted when he was 17 and served in the First Infantry Division.
Originally, Confederate Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, who fought to preserve slavery, was the Benning being honored.
New signage was unveiled Wednesday during a renaming ceremony at the base, which is one of the country’s largest installations. Fred Benning’s granddaughter was there, sharing memories of her grandfather.
Pentagon moves to restore Fort Bragg name to North Carolina’s Fort Liberty

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memo renaming the base last month, saying at the time in a short video statement that “now Fort Benning is back too.”
The move followed the return of Fort Bragg’s name in North Carolina, in that case going with Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran, as the new namesake instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg. It had been renamed Fort Liberty.
The updated names had been the work of a commission on renaming bases honoring Confederates created by Congress, and that commission was part of a defense authorization bill that had enough support in 2020 to override President Donald Trump’s veto during his first term.
Georgia’s Fort Gordon near Augusta was also renamed as part of that push to Fort Eisenhower in 2023 after World War II Army general and 34th President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The original name had honored John B. Gordon, a major general in the Confederate army who went on to serve as Georgia governor and U.S. senator.
In 2023, Fort Benning had been renamed Fort Moore in honor of Lt. Gen. Hal and Julia Moore. During the Vietnam War, while Hal Moore was deployed, Julia worked to change the way the U.S. military handled death notifications. At the time, they were delivered by cabbies carrying a telegram. The couple is buried at the post’s military cemetery.
Lt. Gen. Moore served in the Korean and Vietnam wars. He is co-author of the book “We Were Soldiers Once … And Young,” about the brutal 1965 battle Moore led in Vietnam’s Ia Drang valley.
“Both Hal and Julia Moore remarkably served our country and raised the standard of excellence in the United States Army for servicemen and civilian spouses alike. I am proud that a military base in Georgia was chosen to bear their name, even briefly,” state Sen. Ed Harbison, a Columbus Democrat and military veteran, said shortly after the renaming was announced.
Others were more critical of the change.
“The American people understand the legacy connected to the original name, and Secretary Hegseth’s disingenuous attempt to associate it to a separate soldier is transparent and distasteful,” Margaret Huang, president and CEO Southern Poverty Law Center, said in response to the news last month.
Maj. Gen. Colin Tuley, who is the commanding general of the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, said in public remarks Wednesday that Fred Benning’s life will serve as an inspiration for the thousands of soldiers who train there every year.
Fred Benning was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for “extraordinary heroism in action” in 1918 south of Exermont, France. He took command after his platoon commander was killed and two senior non-commissioned officers were injured. When he returned home, he operated a bakery and later served as mayor of Neligh, Nebraska.
“As we rededicate this post in his honor, may we all strive to embody the very same tenets he exemplified: unwavering dedication to people, inspirational leadership, a relentless pursuit of transformation,” Tuley said. “(His) story reminds us that true heroism is not just defined by rank. It is about that unwavering courage, that selfless service and an enduring commitment to something greater than ourselves.”
None of South Carolina’s bases were renamed.

Data from Wax Lake informed coastal restoration plans like the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority voted Wednesday to fully fund its nearly $2 billion spending plan for next fiscal year, despite more than a quarter of that money being tied up in a project that might never happen.
Gov. Jeff Landry ordered a 90-day pause last week on the nearly $3 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, which would direct water and land-building alluvium from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay. The governor has urged a decrease in the size and scope of the plan because of its expense and potential to adversely affect oyster beds and coastal fisheries 
The 2025-26 fiscal year budget the CPRA approved includes $573 million for the massive sediment diversion. The spending plan goes next to the legislature for final consideration.
The majority of funding for the Mid-Barataria project comes from the nearly $8 billion in settlement money awarded to the state after BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The money is held in a trust overseen by the U.S. Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Those trustees sent a letter to CPRA executive director Glenn Ledet Jr. in November indicating the $2.26 billion already awarded for the Mid-Barataria diversion would be clawed back should the project stop. That means the state would have to “return those funds for future restoration activities.”
The CPRA testified in an Oct. 2024 state senate hearing to already spending around $519 million on the Mid-Barataria plan pre-construction costs and mitigation measures for communities and wildlife that stand to be impacted. Around $394 million of the money already spent went toward construction costs. 
The diversion project has led to lawsuits and political disputes. A group of environmentalists and Plaquemines Parish business owners has challenged the project in court, arguing federal agencies issued permits without taking into account its impact on aquatic species and fisheries. Plaquemines officials have sued separately, arguing the diversion project will increase flood risks in the parish.
CPRA Chairman Gordy Dove argued at Wednesday’s meeting that approving next year’s budget, despite the diversion project’s uncertainty, was essential to support other developments the authority has in the works. Dove, a former Terrebonne Parish president who Landry appointed in 2024 to lead the authority, has openly balked at the price tag for the major diversion.  
“This isn’t the first time a project has been held up,” Dove said, adding that money could be reallocated from Mid-Barataria to the 149 other projects the CPRA has proposed.
They include the Barataria Land Bridge, a structure made with sand dredged from the Mississippi River. Proponents say it’s a less intrusive alternative to the river diversion, while its detractors insist the benefits will be at a far smaller scale and not as long-lasting.
Other projects in the budget include flood risk management efforts in St. Tammany Parish, barrier Island restoration in Grand Isle and marsh creation projects in Bayou Cane and Lake Borgne.
Dwayne Bourgeois, the CPRA member representing Terrebonne Parish, questioned whether it was appropriate to approve a budget with such a large portion of its spending in limbo.         
“We’re voting on something that has a big gap in it, that’s undetermined. But I think at this point it’s unavoidable,” Bourgeois said, noting the need to provide money for other CPRA work. 
“We’ve got a pipeline running right now of all of these projects … I feel like I’ve got a gun to my head,” he added.
While funding for Mid-Barataria remains in the plan, Dove reiterated there has been “no decision made” on whether the project will get final approval. 
Advocacy groups showed up for the CPRA meeting at the State Capitol to support the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which is considered the cornerstone project of Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan.
“The state needs this project,” said Amanda Moore, senior director of the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf program. She said the project is “science-based” and “wildly popular” among Louisiana residents. 
Survey results from the advocacy group Restore the Mississippi River Delta released earlier this week show 83% of respondents approve of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion moving forward. Support for the project was bipartisan among the 800 registered Louisiana voters who responded to the surveys.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8523-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 11:10:23.398612
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-17 14:23:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Advocates want Tweed New Haven Airport to pressure Avelo over deportation flights,Maysoon Khan | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/avelo-deportation-flights-tweed-pressure/,Immigrant rights advocates want Tweed New Haven Airport to reconsider its relationship with Avelo after its deportation flights announcement.,"Immigrant rights advocates want the Tweed New Haven Airport Authority to reconsider its relationship with Avelo Airlines, saying the budget carrier’s decision to transport deportees for the federal government is “bad business.”
Avelo came under fire last week after the company said it would fly charter flights carrying deported immigrants on behalf of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Avelo plans to begin operating the deportation flights out of Mesa, Arizona on May 12.
Since then, thousands of people have signed a petition calling for passengers to boycott Avelo. That petition was launched by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition, which has also organized protests against the airline.
Hope Chavez, who is part of the coalition, urged the airport authority’s board members Wednesday to consider putting pressure on the airline to change course.
“Join with the state of Connecticut in lobbying to not renew Avelo’s various subsidies and fuel tax moratoriums that expire this year,” she said. “Take this opportunity to protect your bottom line and to protect the ethics of what it means to be a New Havener.”
The airline enjoys certain public benefits, including a fuel tax exemption from the state, which is set to expire. Some Democratic state lawmakers are exploring avenues to cut future public benefits Avelo receives.
Avelo said its long-term charter program would provide domestic and international trips to support deportation efforts, according to an April 2025 job posting, which has since been taken down.
The airline said operating deportation flights will give it more stability while it expands service and keeps more than 1,100 employees on the payroll.
The Tweed New Haven Airport Authority oversees operations at the airport, which is Avelo’s largest commercial hub.
During a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday, Robert Reed, the chairman of the authority, didn’t directly address the controversy, but read aloud a prepared remark, which he said was not alluding to anything specific.
“Every airport experiences push and pull dynamics as we balance operations, passenger experience, and the business of running a travel hub,” Reed said. “Tensions between airports and their tenant airlines are not only normal, they are a healthy part of business.”
Avelo flew more than half a million passengers from the airport last year, according to the authority.
Airline spokesperson Courtney Gaff told Connecticut Public in an email that the deportation flights would “offset revenue loss across the airline’s entire network.” She added that the airline flew these types of charters under the Biden administration.
Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, asked Avelo last week to provide a copy of its contract related to the deportation flights by April 15. The airline declined, however, writing in a letter signed by Avelo CEO Andrew Levy that the contract could be obtained through a request to DHS made under the Freedom of Information Act.
“Avelo remains committed to public safety and the rule of law,” Levy wrote, “as evidenced by our public, continuous, and persistent compliance with all federal regulations governing commercial air travel in the United States.”

(Photo: Courtesy of the Western North Carolina Tenants Network.)Eviction filings are rarely a win for landlords, according to a new research brief by The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) titled, “Beyond Eviction: Landlords as Essential Partners in Housing Stability.”
Despite common perceptions, eviction proceedings seldom result in landlords recovering back rent and often lead to prolonged income loss, the study’s authors said. A single eviction cost landlords, on average, $2,500 to $8,000, they said.
“Even with a court judgment in their favor, landlords struggle to collect the rent they are owed — particularly from tenants with limited financial resources,” the authors said. “Research suggests that fewer than 10 percent of landlords successfully collect all owed back rent after a judgment in their favor.”
For tenants, the eviction process causes them to fall further behind on their rent, face possible homelessness and struggle to find housing and work because of an eviction on their record, the authors said. More than one in three renter households experiences a housing related civil legal issue each year, they said.
The LSC brief is part of a congressionally directed study to investigate the unmet legal needs surrounding eviction in the United States. “Beyond Eviction: Landlords as Essential Partners in Housing Stability” is one of several briefs produced as part of  the study. A final report will serve as the culmination of the study.
Click here to see the Eviction Laws Database to learn more about eviction laws in your state. The interactive map was developed by LSC in partnership with the Center for Public Health Law Research at Temple University. It examines how eviction laws and procedures differ across states and territories—and what those differences mean for tenants, landlords and communities.
Key takeaways of the brief include:

Most eviction filings involve rent-burdened households—people paying over 30% of their income toward housing. More than one-quarter of all rental units in the U.S. are owned by small, “mom-and-pop” landlords who often rely on timely rent to cover expenses. These factors together create a fragile balance.
Despite common perceptions, eviction proceedings rarely result in landlords recovering all rent owed. In fact, filing for eviction is likely to lead to prolonged income loss, greater administrative burdens and additional costs for future tenants.
By working together, landlords and legal aid providers can reduce financial losses, improve stability for all parties and minimize the costs and disruptions of eviction.
When a case does end up in eviction court, legal representation for tenants benefits both parties, as well as the court system. Legal counsel helps to streamline the process, leading to quicker resolutions where all parties understand their obligations.
The brief also highlights partnership strategies that are helping landlords and civil legal aid collaborate to create less contentious paths to stable revenue and build healthier communities. The efforts include providing pre-filing notices, rental assistance programs and eviction diversion and prevention programs.

“By encouraging communication and building trust, legal aid can help both parties find sustainable solutions that avoid costly and disruptive eviction court action,” the authors said.
In North Carolina, 48% of renters are considered cost-burdened because they spend more than 30% of income on housing needs, according to the NC Housing Coalition’s 2025 County Profiles of state housing needs. Meanwhile, 19% of homeowners are cost-burdened. Across the state, 194,526 families faced an eviction filing last year and 11,394 families faced foreclosure, according to the report.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eviction-Rally.jpg,,,2025-04-17 10:18:48.965850

Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which also has one location in Rhode Island, found out about the pause on March 31.
The funding comes from Title X, which funds sexual and reproductive health care for low-income people. It doesn’t fund abortions.
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz (D) spoke with advocates at the Capitol on Wednesday. She said Connecticut is one of 23 states impacted.
“Withholding these funds is really an attempt to cut off access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI and STD testing and reproductive health care in general,” Bysiewicz said. “This is a major public health concern.”
HHS told TIME they’re pausing the funding while they review possible violations of civil rights laws and an executive order from President Trump that bars undocumented immigrants from getting taxpayer-funded benefits.
Each of the organizations with grants on hold received a letter explaining the reason for the pause, according to an HHS spokesperson. The letter requested documentation within 10 days to assess compliance with grant terms and conditions.
WSHU asked HHS how long the review would take but did not receive an answer.
Gretchen Raffa, PPSNE’s chief policy and advocacy officer, said the pause would hurt the 41,000 people in Connecticut who rely on Title X funding at her organization.
“This decision will have devastating consequences, especially for Black and Latino communities, women, people living in rural areas, and those living with low incomes, the very communities that already face the highest barriers to care,” Raffa said. “This move will only widen those disparities and make it harder, if not impossible, for many people to get the health care they need and they deserve.”
Last month, Connecticut lawmakers allocated $800,000 to Planned Parenthood, citing federal funding uncertainty.
Bysiewicz said the legislature would continue to assess the situation to determine if further state funding is needed.

Robert Dole.,"Jami Reever, executive director for Kansas Appleseed, said on the 10-year anniversary of a state law restricting access to food program benefits that Kansas ought to honor the legacy of the late U.S. Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kansas, by aligning policy with programs demonstrated to reduce hunger. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The advocacy organization Kansas Appleseed marked the 10th anniversary of the HOPE Act by denouncing the legacy of a state law blamed for undermining food security and work of the late U.S. Sen. Robert Dole to aid malnourished people.
The HOPE Act, formally known as the Kansas Hope, Opportunity and Prosperity for Everyone Act, was signed into law in April 2015 by then-Gov. Sam Brownback. The measure significantly increased barriers to participation among Kansans in SNAP, previously known as the food stamp program. In the subsequent decade, Republican leadership in the Kansas Legislature has continued to seek expansion of restrictions on SNAP beyond minimum requirements in federal law.
“As a born-and-raised Kansan, living just 30 miles from Bob Dole’s hometown, I knew from a young age that if Bob Dole fought for something, it was the right thing to do.” said Jami Reever, executive director for Kansas Appleseed. “His fight to end hunger became Kansas’ fight to end hunger, and to see that legacy stripped away year after year is contrary to Kansas values.”
On Wednesday, Kansas Appleseed released a report on the 10-year anniversary of the HOPE Act that outlined political history of anti-hunger initiatives tied to Kansas, challenged criticism of SNAP and recommended the state embrace policies to better meet food needs of families.
The report said Kansas ranked 48th among the states and District of Columbia in terms of SNAP access. The state ranked fifth-lowest in terms of the rate of eligible people enrolled in SNAP, Kansas Appleseed said.
“This report highlights the sharp contrast between our state’s regressive approach to SNAP and the compassionate, bipartisan legacy of feeding people that Kansas forefather Bob Dole left our state,” said Haley Kottler of Kansas Appleseed. “Because of these regressive approaches, Kansas has gone from leading the nation on anti-hunger efforts to becoming one of the hardest places to access SNAP. That is not who we are, and it is not who we have to be.”
Kansas Appleseed proposed enhancing access to SNAP to mirror “real needs of everyday, hardworking Kansans.” Research showed participation in SNAP improved dietary intake, supported mental health, reduced poverty and promoted economic self-sufficiency, Kansas Appleseed said.
 HOPE Act?
In 2015, Brownback took on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program borne of bipartisan advocacy by Republican U.S. Sen. Dole of Kansas and the late Democratic U.S. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota.
Brownback signed the HOPE Act to limit adults without children to three months on SNAP during any 36-month period in which the person wasn’t employed part-time or enrolled in job training. In addition, individuals with a felony drug conviction were given a lifetime ban from SNAP in Kansas.
People without authority to legally live in the United States were excluded from calculations of household size when determining SNAP eligibility, but earnings of those immigrants was counted when assessing whether a household qualified in terms of overall income. The law also forbid use of federal or state funding to inform the public about available food assistance.
Brownback also banned use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cash assistance to buy alcohol, cigarettes or lottery, concert or sports event tickets. TANF cash couldn’t be expended in a movie theater, swimming pool, theme park or video arcade.
Brownback said the idea was to implement state laws that could compel people to lift themselves out of poverty.
“The primary focus of the bill is to get people back to work,” Brownback said at the time. “Because that’s where the real benefit is — getting people off public assistance and back into the marketplace with the dignity.”
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who voted against the HOPE Act in 2015 while a member of the Kansas Senate, said state laws undermining the potential of SNAP and TANF were a mistake.
“The HOPE Act was wrong then, and it remains wrong now,” Kelly said. “Now, more than ever, the Legislature should look for ways to support working Kansas families rather than further shredding the safety net that gives Kansans a bridge back to self-sufficiency.”
Research by a University of Kansas professor indicated state policy or law limiting enrollment in SNAP made it more difficult to prevent child abuse or neglect as well as prevent entry of children into foster care. In aftermath of the HOPE Act, the number of Kansas children in foster care reached a record level.
SNAP under attack
Hunger Free America reported U.S. Department of Agriculture data indicated 15.3% of Kansas residents lived in food insecure households between 2021 to 2023. That included 13.6% of children, 8.4% of working adults and 6.6% of elderly residents in Kansas.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, created in 2022 the House Welfare Reform Committee to advance the welfare agenda started by Brownback. In a speech, Hawkins said the state should focus on shrinking government rather than “growing the welfare state and dependency.”
He said tax dollars ought to be reserved for “the truly needy instead of siphoning them away to able-bodied adults who don’t want to work.”
That point of emphasis led to House Bill 2140, which was advanced in 2023 to further limit eligibility for SNAP. Existing law at that time blocked SNAP benefits to able-bodied adults 18 to 49 without dependents and not employed at least 30 hours per week unless they were in a job training program. The bill, which died in the Senate, would have extended the prohibition to Kansans 50 to 59 years of age.
Another piece of legislation in 2023, endorsed by the Florida think tank Opportunity Solutions Project, would cut SNAP benefits to noncustodial parents who fell behind in child support payments. GOP advocates of the concept said the legislation would withhold food aid from families as leverage to extract cash from “deadbeat” parents.
Sen. Oletha Faust Goudeau, a Wichita Democrat, said the bill would have made it less likely parents could support their children and more likely people went hungry.
“Reducing access to food for Kansans who are already struggling financially is unnecessarily harsh and ineffective,” Faust Goudeau said.
In the 2025 session, the House and Senate approved a bill requiring the state to seek permission from USDA to exclude candy and soft drinks from Kansas’ list of products eligible to be bought with SNAP benefits. Kelly vetoed the bill. The Senate voted to override the governor, but the House didn’t challenge the veto.

Jared Polis delivers his state of the state address in the House chamber of the Colorado Capitol building in Denver Jan. 9, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post/Pool)About a week after the November election, as dread of a new Trump administration took hold throughout much of the country, the launch of an interstate initiative to protect democracy and the rule of law offered a message of optimism amid an otherwise bleak run of news. The initiative, an alliance called Governors Safeguarding Democracy, would be chaired by Govs. Jared Polis of Colorado and JB Pritzker of Illinois.
“We founded GSD because we know that simple hope alone won’t save our democracy. We need to work together, especially at the state level, to protect and strengthen it,” Polis said at the time.
Five months on, it’s not clear that the alliance has done much of anything to protect democracy or the rule of law. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has rapidly transformed the federal government into a terrorizing instrument of authoritarian rule, wherein democratic principles are ignored and the rule of law is mocked. America by some measures has ceased even to qualify as a democracy, and armed agents of the state now snatch people from neighborhood streets and deliver them to brutal prisons in other countries.
Any optimism inspired by the GSD initiative has proved misplaced, and Polis appears to be unprepared for the historic emergency that faces the country.
But he’s not alone. Other leading Democrats in Colorado similarly seem blind to the acute dangers ahead. They have little to offer Coloradans beyond simple hope.

Newsline recently sent Polis’ office a set of questions about GSD’s activities. Which governors had joined the alliance? What actions has Polis taken as co-chair?
A spokesperson for the governor responded that “this nonpartisan organization continues to bring together think tanks, legal experts, and democracy advocates to inform policy that protects the rule of law and serves the people of our states.” She provided no specifics, and she gave no indication that Polis had taken any single specific action to advance GSD goals.
A spokesperson for GSD provided a little more information when asked similar questions, writing in an email that “GSD provides legal and policy tools and resources and hosts briefings on a range of issues” and that governors’ offices have “issued executive orders to create taskforces on immigration matters, hiring practices, and efforts to recruit federal workers laid off or fired by the federal government.”
Polis has issued no executive orders related to GSD’s work.
The spokesperson also said that much of the work is “behind-the-scenes.” She provided virtually no specifics.
It might be the case that GSD’s work occurs out of view, but if the outcome of that work is also invisible, it’s meaningless, and if its work were at all effective, democracy and the rule of law wouldn’t be vanishing.
Federal authorities have rounded up an untold number of Colorado residents under questionable legal authority and with almost no transparency. At least two of those people are at risk of being disappeared into the CECOT prison in El Salvador. If Polis wants to protect the rule of law, he should say something about their case.
On the contrary, Polis has helped legitimize parts of Trump’s agenda. He cheered the appointment of conspiracist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services and has welcomed major elements of Trump’s mass deportation plan.
Other top Colorado Democrats, such U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, have also failed to offer a persuasive check to MAGA threats.
Bennet stands out for particular reproof. His votes in the Senate, like Hickenlooper’s, have aligned with Trump’s agenda at an alarming rate, but now he wants to ditch D.C. and serve as Colorado’s next governor. In a speech at Denver’s City Park to announce his campaign, Bennet acknowledged that “everything we care about now is at stake in our country,” but the line lands like a focus group-tested talking point when weighed against the balance of Bennet’s pick-your-battles posture toward Trumpist fascism.
In an interview on 9News last week, Bennet bizarrely framed the 2024 election, in which an aspiring autocrat and convicted felon baited the electorate’s id and poisoned the national conversation with prolific lies, as a good faith contest that Democrats deserved to lose. Challenged by host Kyle Clark to specify how support for Trump Cabinet members has helped Colorado, Bennet all but acknowledged it does not.
“I think that’s a fair question,” Bennet said. “And we’ll have to look two years from now to really answer it.”
Does Bennet actually think we have two years to find out?
Other Democrats — though frighteningly few — understand that we don’t, and they have begun to model what real resistance to a fledgling dictatorship looks like.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, speaking on threats to American democracy, recently delivered the longest floor speech in U.S. Senate history. “These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said.
Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently visited cities, including Denver and Greeley, around the country as part of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. Their events drew tens of thousands of people who were eager to show up in person as a form of rebuke against anti-democracy forces.
Polis’ GSD partner Pritzker has been frank and outspoken in describing what Trump is doing to the country, comparing Trump’s vision for America to Nazi Germany.
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, is at the vanguard of the legal fight against Trump.
Such instances of resistance might not result in immediate change, but they are welcome alternatives to the shoulder-shrugging and rank complicity practiced by other Democrats, who appear to equate minority status in Washington with helplessness.
Booker is right. These are not normal times. They call for extraordinary action. They call for elected leaders to do everything in their power to protect democracy and the rule of law. Simple hope alone won’t cut it.

The Susitna is threatened by the West Susitna Access Project, according to this year's report released by the conservation group American Rivers. (Photo provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Alaska ShoreZone program)Southcentral Alaska’s Susitna River is one of the nation’s most endangered rivers because of a state plan to build a 100-mile road into its uplands to encourage mining, oil and gas drilling, logging and other development, according to a report released Wednesday.
The Susitna ranked eighth on a list of 10 threatened waterways cited in the annual report issued by the conservation group American Rivers.
The 10 sites in the report, titled America’s Most Endangered Rivers of 2025, were chosen according to their ecological and community importance, the magnitude of the threats from pollution, development or other factors and the opportunities for the public to sway pending policy decisions.
For the Susitna, the threat comes from the West Susitna Access Project, according to the report. The project, being pursued by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, proposes a road linking the Parks Highway north of Anchorage to the roadless upstream area of the Skwentna River, a Susitna River tributary that runs along the base of the Tordrillo Mountains.
The road would cross 180 streams, degrading hunting, fishing and wildlife habitat, and the mining, drilling and other resource extraction enabled by the road would contaminate the river’s water and the air above it, the report said. That, in turn, would threaten fishing-related businesses and harvesters, local tourism and communities, including Alaska Native communities dependent on the river’s resources for subsistence food-gathering, the report said.
The report urges the public to join the campaign against the road project by submitting comments during the ongoing environmental review process to oppose any U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit approval. The report also urges the public to campaign against any federal funding of the project.
Organizations that advised American Rivers on the Susitna River’s status included the Susitna River Coalition, Cook Inletkeeper and the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, a Tribal government.
“The West Susitna Industrial Access Road will bring sweeping changes to our region—transforming fish and wildlife habitat, altering subsistence resources, decimating sustainable economies, and reshaping the outdoor experiences that Alaskans and visitors from around the world cherish,” Margaret Stern, program and communications director for the Susitna River Coalition, said in a statement released by American Rivers. “This boondoggle project would open the door to large-scale industrial development in one of the world’s last truly wild places. We must ensure that local communities, hunters, anglers, and all advocates for wild spaces make their voices heard in ensuring the future of this unique region.”
Officials from the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and AIDEA did not immediately respond to questions about the American Rivers report.
The West Susitna Access Project stretches back more than a decade.

	Supporters say it would unlock economic opportunities for the state. That argument is made in a short video posted on AIDEA’s website.
“Millions of acres of state lands lie west of the Susitna River, providing new opportunities to Alaskans for outdoor recreation, jobs and economic growth. These lands hold critical minerals and other stranded resources that are vital for Alaska’s economic future,” the video’s narrator says.
The project was originally proposed in 2013 as part of then-Gov. Sean Parnell’s Roads to Resources program, which envisioned numerous new roads that would enable resource extraction in remote areas of the state.
In 2023, the project was split in two, with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities in charge of the envisioned first 22 miles and AIDEA leading development plans for the remaining miles.
The state transportation department, which would use a combination of state and federal funding for the project, has launched an environmental review process needed to obtain a wetlands-development permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
However, Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s request for $2.5 million to help move the project along was omitted from the state capital budget that the Alaska Senate passed unanimously on Tuesday.
Other Alaska rivers have made the annual list in past years, including the Kobuk River, which was in the 2024 report because of the proposed Ambler Access Project, which proposes an industrial road of about 200 miles into the Brooks Range foothills.
Other U.S. rivers listed in this year’s report as being among the 10 most endangered are in different parts of the Lower 48 states.
The Mississippi River, which passes through several states, topped the endangered list. American Rivers based that status on increased flooding and what it categorized as inadequate flood prevention and response.

(Photo: Jeff Anderson/ USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service)Imagine you want to create and control a large pool of capital predominantly financed by grants and other people’s money. Simply define a geographic boundary, let’s call it a ‘district,’ and get a few business colleagues to decide what mandatory fee or compulsory assessment you’re going to collect to benefit your private business agendas. Next, petition a state senator and county commissioner; most are eager to curry favor with deep-pocketed business donors. Create a nonprofit to which you will funnel the dollars. Small business owners will be required to collect the fee at the point of sale in your district. You hold the cards because you’ve engineered the framework and set the fee percentage. Sounds a bit Sopranos-like, doesn’t it?
Schemes like this – blandly called Business Improvement Districts or BIDs – are undemocratic but legal ways to levy fees (effectively a sales tax when businesses pass the cost of the fees on to consumers) that benefit the few over the many. BIDs first appeared in the 1970s, but have become a controversial power grab for business interests and developers in recent years to finance tourism destination dreams and pet projects outside of public control or view. BIDs represent a particular risk for unincorporated areas because there are no elected mayors or city councils to hold public meetings or be answerable. 
All citizens and small business owners should be concerned. A few influential businesses or developers can band together and force new recurring costs on an entire community – tacked on at the point of sale. Worse still, the International Journal of Public Administration noted: “BIDs have arisen as a new form of ‘private government.’ As they expand their menus of services, often including land-use planning, and approaching more general-purpose government status, BIDs have begun to raise issues of accountability.”
Private governments with little transparency
Where might you begin such a monetary diversion maneuver in Nevada?  Follow the play book of Nevada Democratic state Sen. Skip Daly, who, at the behest of unelected people – such as Julie Regan, executive director of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), tourism executive Andy Chapman, now Chair of the Tahoe Transportation District, and TRPA government affairs manager Devin Middlebrook along with legal consulting firm Civitas Advisers – successfully advanced a BID proposal to a panel of his fellow legislators during an interim meeting last year. Put forward by TRPA (a bi-state agency with lots of political sway), their business cronies who will determine BID details — such as where to draw geographic boundaries, how much to levy and where to spend funds — also promoted the bill.
If this is the first time you’ve heard about this fast-moving state legislation, Senate bill 420, that’s by design. Tax-like enabling legislation that will negatively impact constituent wallets is best kept under wraps. 
How is SB420 novel?
SB420 needs state-level approval because there’s no existing legal path to create a BID in unincorporated portions of a Nevada county. Existing Nevada law (like NRS 271A for Tourism Improvement Districts) focuses on cities and municipal projects. As called out in the Lake Tahoe Destination Stewardship plan (p. 38), “legislation would need to be pursued” as “there is currently no statute enabling this sort of improvement district in Nevada,” Hence, testimony from Chapman, President and CEO of Travel North Tahoe Nevada, on April 4: “Senate Bill 420 will create the ability for local businesses within the Nevada portion of the Tahoe Basin to petition the relevant county to create a Business Improvement District (known as a BID), which could only be created with the support of the business community AND approval by the County Commission.”
The goal for this improvement district mechanism is to create a long-term funding solution for issues in Nevada’s Lake Tahoe area. This type of improvement district legislation exists already in California.  As written SB420’s BID model is funded through the levy of assessments on business. However, it’s not clear what businesses this bill will encompass or exempt. Section 6.1 defines “business” as all types of businesses, including, without limitations financial institutions and professions.” That means if a business license address lies inside the proposed boundary, that business license holder could be assessed. SB420 includes a broad scope of what activities can be undertaken, but residents don’t have a voice. 
If signed into law, SB420 could create a template in Nevada for future quasi-governmental taxation in counties, virtually unregulated by the legislature or department of taxation. 
If other broadly written BIDs elsewhere are any indication, more surprises lie ahead. Residents of Rochester, New York, characterized a proposed BID there “as a shadow government.”  While told that businesses would pay for the BID, reporters learned, as residents suspected, it would be mostly taxpayers who would fund the BID managed by 17 “movers and shakers in business and political circles” — members of a nonprofit established to control the Rochester BID. 
BIDs are hard to undo. When formed BIDs become legal special districts, in Nevada’s case, under state law. Dissolving a BID, governed by a management plan written by consultants like Civitas who obtain multi-year contracts, usually requires approval from the same body that created it. Who likes to relinquish money and power? Businesses – particularly tourism outfits with multiple locations or headquartered elsewhere – can get away with charging added fees because of high-turnover visitors. BID members can even use money generated by the fees to market themselves.  Self-dealing at its worst. 
Residents who shop, dine or recreate within a ‘district’ always pay the fee. Communities effectively subsidize private agendas. Residents in San Diego revealed how Civitas’ founder has a history of creating legal loopholes (p. 14). Civitas Advisors as of March 2013 had pocketed $546,016 and counting from San Diego alone; lawsuits followed.
The Sacramento-based firm has expanded overseas but now wants to make Nevada its newest client.
‘I think it’s taxation’
SB420 took shape August 16 at the interim Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System. None of Northern Nevadans’ public concerns about public safety and the environment are mentioned or considered in the recommendations for legislation. Instead Daly, at the sixth and final meeting along with other legislators, agreed to advance TRPA’s wish list, including the BID legislation. In the meeting (1:51:24 on the recording), Civitas – the legal firm that stands to profit handsomely to administer BIDs – testified, not surprisingly, in support of it. 
Senator Robin Titus (minutes, p.16), however, saw the scheme for what it is: “I am going to be a ‘no’ on this when it comes to a vote. I truly cannot accept—I think [it’s] a taxation.”
Assemblymember Ken Gray shared the concerns: “I want to echo Senator Titus’ comments as well.”
Citizens (not business owners) who participated in the April 4 Senate working session opposed the BID legislation and its lack of specificity. BID activities in SB420 include promotion of events, marketing and economic development, transportation and other services that confer “benefit upon assessed businesses in the district.”  
If this isn’t a tax why does the state legislature need to have a bill that involves the Department of Taxation to facilitate what businesses should be managing or funding on their own. Is SB420 really in the best interests of Nevada residents? This should be a red flag for other state legislatures who’ve been lobbied to create similar legislation.
Transportation alone is a heavy lift. Even the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration agrees. Among BID disadvantages it lists:

“BIDs are not public agencies and cannot be directed to accomplish transportation goals, services or facilities desired by elected officials and agencies. 
“BIDs, as private entities, will not fund public goods or services that provide benefits outside the BID boundaries. Also due to sunset provisions, they are not typically structured to facilitate the development of large infrastructure facilities that require financing.”

Many residents first read the SB420 language amendments only after the bill was advanced out of committee as one of 48 bills reviewed by the Senate Government Affairs Committee April 11. No matter; public comment was reserved for the end of the meeting after voting had ended.
Two senators, Lisa Rogich and Lisa Krasner, went on record to say they reserved the right to change their vote later. Rogich went further, “I’m hoping the parties can continue to have conversations with the community and get the residents on board.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-5-9-24-at-7.37-PM-1024x622.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 10:18:48.965850

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.


DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told a crowd gathered in a Denver high school auditorium Wednesday night that opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration are fighting “to keep America, America.”
Weiser welcomed three of his counterparts from other states — Attorneys General Nick Brown of Washington, Anne Lopez of Hawaii and Aaron Ford of Nevada — for the latest in a series of “community impact hearings” on Trump’s agenda at George Washington High School.
The four are among the 23 elected Democratic attorneys general nationwide who have led the fight against the second Trump administration’s agenda in the courts. Weiser has sued Trump at least a dozen times so far, including challenges to the administration’s attempt to end the 14th Amendment’s protections for birthright citizenship; its sweeping freeze of many federal grant and aid programs; its mass layoffs of federal employees; and its defunding of medical research through the National Institutes of Health.

Weiser said the legal challenges have borne some fruit in the form of preliminary injunctions and other procedural victories, but acknowledged growing alarm over whether “this democratic republic (will) hold.”
“These court victories are important, but more important is everyone’s voice,” Weiser said, encouraging the crowd to join protests like the one that drew 8,000 people to the Colorado Capitol on April 5. “We need to use our voice.”
Here are the legal actions Colorado has taken against Trump administration

Wednesday’s event came amid an outcry this week over the fates of more than 200 immigrants deported by the Trump administration to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and promises by Trump to send American citizens there next. At least one of the deportees, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members of many others say that they were falsely identified as members of a transnational gang because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
The administration has also moved to target hundreds of lawful permanent residents and student visa holders for deportation, including Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations at Columbia University, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student who was detained after writing an op-ed in her student newspaper. Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado woman without legal status who was detained by federal authorities last month, have also alleged in court that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra for her immigration advocacy work.
“We won’t tolerate people being picked up without any process and shipped to some other country with no recourse,” Weiser told the crowd to applause. “The First Amendment matters, because when you speak, and you speak your truth, you cannot be — in this country — retaliated against for speaking your truth.”
Weiser, serving his second term as attorney general after winning reelection in 2022, is running for Colorado governor in 2026. He faces a tough primary contest against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who entered the race last week.
Constitutional crisis?
Weiser and his fellow attorneys general heard stories from Coloradans personally impacted by the Trump administration’s actions, including federal workers, homelessness service providers and refugee support organizations.
Marya Washburn, a U.S. Forest Service employee, was part of a firefighting team that responded to the Alexander Mountain Fire in Colorado last summer. In February, she was among the 3,400 probationary employees at the agency to receive termination notices from the Trump administration, and although she was reinstated thanks to a court order, that order is set to end on Saturday.
“I’m shaking,” Washburn said as she read from her notes, citing concerns about cuts to firefighting personnel ahead of the 2025 fire season. “I’m angry.”
Trump’s mass layoffs, funding freezes and attempted shutdowns of congressionally-established agencies amount to an unprecedented expansion of executive power that runs contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution. Fears that his administration will defy adverse court rulings have also reached new heights in recent days, especially following its apparent inaction in the face of a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling last week stating the administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.
Brown, elected as Washington attorney general last year, said that the outcomes of some legal challenges to the administration — like the restoration of grant funding that Trump had attempted to freeze — had “for the most part” given him “confidence in our system.” But that confidence is now being tested.
“This is the first time — this week, in the days past — where I think we’re really getting to the precipice of a constitutional crisis,” he said. “And I don’t say that lightly.”
“I don’t have all the answers. I do not know what it means for a president to blatantly disregard what a court says. I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” Brown continued. “But we might be there tomorrow, or next week.”

Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) joined Mothering Justice for an event in Lansing to mark Black Maternal Health Week on Wednesday.
She said events like the advocacy day organized by Mothering Justice are important to the legislative process.
“Legislation usually starts, unfortunately, when something may have gone wrong or something is under attack,” Young said. “And we’re in a space now where so many things are under attack.”
A “momnibus” bill package that seeks to reduce racial inequities in maternal mortality is currently working its way through the Michigan Senate. While policies in the package had bipartisan support last legislative session, state Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) noted last month when the package was reintroduced that the bills became a “lame duck casualty of the House” after Republican lawmakers boycotted session in December in protest to minimum and tipped wage reforms not being placed for a vote.



Black Maternal Health Statistics
In 2023, the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic White women. (CDC, 2025). 
In the U.S., Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women. CDC notes that more than 80% of pregnancy related deaths are preventable (CDC, 2024)
In 2022, the rate of preterm birth among Black women (12.34%) was about 1.5 times higher than the rate of preterm birth among white or Hispanic women, 7.64% and 8.72% respectively. (CDC, 2024)
Statistics provided by Black Mamas Matter Alliance.



Young said at Wednesday’s event that “just to talk about Black mamas is under attack now.”
“We were okay with lifting it up before, but now it is like a dog whistle for people,” Young said.
She said the heightened reactivity has led her to tailor her message to each audience individually.
“I can get what I need to get for Black mamas without saying ‘Black mama’ sometimes, but I can be in some spaces where that’s all I’m going to say. But I just know who I’m dealing with,” Young said. “So we’re learning how to be strategic.”

But Young added that Black women face increased challenges in the health care system than their white counterparts, including in being believed when they say something is wrong or that they need medication.
“If a house is on fire on the block with 20 houses, do you stop at the other 19, or do you focus on the one that’s in the most jeopardy, the one that’s about to go up in flames?” Young said. “When we talk about Black maternal health, it’s because we’ve been the ones that’s been in the most jeopardy of not getting the services that we needed.”

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Two teachers unions, parents, advocates sue over Trump dismantling of Department of Education

Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Trump signs order directing Education secretary to shut down her own department

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
Rounds re-introduces bill to eliminate federal Department of Education

“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

If you’ve experienced any trouble or hiccups receiving your Social Security recently, California Attorney General Rob Bonta unveiled a new complaint page on Tuesday for residents to report disruptions they faced when accessing their benefits.
Social Security is funded by payroll taxes from today’s workers, which provide financial assistance to retired and disabled workers. Roughly 6 million Californians receive the benefit and more than 65 million Americans do in total. “Social Security is an essential program that provides critical support to millions…” a 2023 brief from Stanford University found.
As part of President Donald Trump’s push to slash federal spending, the Social Security Administration said in February that it would cut 7,000 jobs — or roughly 12% of its overall workforce. It also said it would reorganize its 10 regional offices down to four.
Though most of Bonta’s complaint form is applicable to those already receiving benefits, many of the reported confusion surrounding the agency’s changes relate to newly eligible people trying to sign up for benefits.
Agency offices, for example, are no longer accepting walk-in appointments. There have also been many reports of people facing longer wait times for appointments and to receive their first benefits and Medicare coverage. In Southern California, elderly people who rode the bus for hours to get to Social Security offices were reportedly turned away, according to The New York Times. People who call the Social Security Administration have waited hours on hold for someone to answer. Those who’ve tried to access their accounts online this week were taken to a dead-end page that says “Bad request.” 
To rein in “widespread fraud” — a claim repeatedly made by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency, and characterized by fact-checkers as exaggerated and misleading — the agency also planned to require in-person proof of eligibility. This meant that starting April 14, people would have no longer been able to file for benefits over the phone. But after receiving backlash from advocates and members of Congress, the agency walked back these restrictions.
On Wednesday Bonta also joined 20 other attorneys general in support of the American Association of People with Disabilities’ lawsuit challenging the Social Security Administration’s staffing cuts and policy changes. 

Bonta, in a statement: “Through their erratic and illegal actions, the Trump Administration and DOGE have weakened both the Social Security Administration’s ability to serve people and the public’s trust in essential government services. This has made it harder — at times impossible — for older adults and persons with disabilities to access the lifesaving benefits and services they depend on.”

CA sues over tariffs

Speaking of Trump and Bonta, the attorney general joined with Gov. Gavin Newsom Wednesday to say they are suing Trump and other federal officials over the administration’s tariffs initially imposed earlier this month, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In April the president invoked “emergency economic powers” to levy a 10% tariff on all countries importing goods to the U.S., as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on some other nations. But within hours after taking effect, Trump paused most of the reciprocal tariffs, while also increasing China’s import tax.
The fallout resulted in a $6.6 trillion wipeout in the stock market in the first few days, and poses a major risk for California’s public pensions and state budget — which is partially dependent on the income tax generated from stocks. China is also California’s largest trading partner.

Newsom, in a statement: “President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs. We’re standing up for American families who can’t afford to let the chaos continue.”

The lawsuit argues that without specific authorization from Congress, Trump’s actions are “unlawful,” and calls for a judge to immediately pause the tariffs.

Sonoma State cuts; dual enrollment problems

Let’s dive into some higher education news:

Injunction against Sonoma State University: Facing a $24 million budget gap and steep declines in enrollment, Sonoma State in January said it planned to terminate more than a dozen majors for the 2025-26 academic year and eliminate the university’s intercollegiate sports teams. But on Tuesday a county judge temporarily blocked California State University leaders from cutting Sonoma State’s academic programs after student athletes sued, arguing that the university didn’t follow system procedures. A new hearing is scheduled for May 1. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Inequities in dual enrollment courses: High school students wanting to get a headstart on their college education can take dual enrollment courses, which allow them to attend a community college, typically for free. Students in these programs are more likely to go on to a community college or university compared to their peers who aren’t. But California rural students, male students and students of color don’t enroll in and complete dual enrollment courses at the same rate as others — potentially leading them to miss out on opportunities that better prepare them for college.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The U.S. Interior this week announced the transfer of close to 110,000 acres along New Mexico’s southern border to the U.S. Army. According to a news release, the transfer is intended to “safeguard sensitive natural and cultural resources in the region while enabling the Department of the Army to support U.S. Border Patrol operations in securing the border and preventing illegal immigration.”
The transfer follows a memorandum President Donald Trump signed last week directing several agencies to start militarizing a stretch of the southern border, an escalation of the administration’s use of the U.S. military amid its immigration crackdown.
“Securing our border and protecting our nation’s resources go hand in hand,” Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “The American people gave President Trump a mandate to make America safe and strong again. This transfer reflects Interior’s commitment to public safety, national security and responsible stewardship of our public lands.”
According to the Interior, the transfer came at the Army’s request “to allow for the increase in regular patrols by federal personnel, construction of infrastructure to prevent unlawful entry, disrupt foreign terrorist threats to the U.S., and to curb illegal cross-border activities, such as unlawful migration, narcotics trafficking, migrant smuggling, and human trafficking.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) whose congressional district includes the state’s border towns, earlier this week condemned Trump’s move to militarize the border “misguided and wasteful.” In a statement provided to Source, Vasquez said: “Deploying military assets to the border, during a record time of low crossing numbers, is a misguided and wasteful use of military resources and taxpayer dollars. As a lifelong border resident who has spent years working with border stakeholders, I can tell you that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work—and in some places, including parts of New Mexico’s Bootheel, this kind of made-for-TV stunt does little to nothing to solve our nation’s broken immigration system.”
The Interior news release notes that the “crisis along the border” also includes an “environmental crisis,” noting that the area along the border hosts 23 federally endangered species as well as cultural sites “that range from small artifact scatters to large multi-room pueblos. Transfer of the management of this land to the Army will facilitate military engagement to prevent unauthorized human activity in ecologically sensitive areas along the southern border, which can be harmed by repeated foot traffic, unregulated vehicle use, and the creation of informal trails or camps.” In addition, “high-traffic illegal crossings can lead to soil erosion, damage to fragile desert vegetation and critical wildlife habitat, loss and damage to cultural resources, increased fire risk and pollution from trash and human waste.”
Two service members deployed to the border were killed earlier this week, and one was injured, in a vehicle accident near Santa Teresa.
In a statement following the accident, Vasquez said he was “deeply saddened by the tragic loss of two service members today near Santa Teresa. My thoughts are with their families, loved ones, and fellow service members during this difficult time. With the recent deployments to and the new mission at the Southern border, we must fully review the circumstances surrounding this incident. We owe it to them—and all who serve—to ensure their safety is never compromised.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/borderfence-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

California was allowed to include students without legal status, which the Trump administration is now ending.","In summary
Federal programs offer financial aid and counseling to low-income and first-generation college students. California was allowed to include students without legal status, which the Trump administration is now ending. 


President Donald Trump has taken aim at students and professors at California’s elite institutions, such as UC Berkeley and UCLA, but community colleges, which enroll the majority of the state’s students, have largely avoided the administration’s ire.
Until recently. The U.S. Department of Education announced on March 27 that it was stopping California universities and colleges from using federal funding to “provide services to illegal immigrants.” The education department is specifically referring to federal TRIO programs, which provide various forms of financial aid and counseling to low-income, first-generation students. 
California schools don’t track how many of their students lack legal status. Although exact figures are hard to capture, some estimates, such as the number of applications for in-state aid, suggest that there are thousands of students without legal status, most of whom are attending California’s community colleges.  
More than 100,000 students in California are enrolled in a TRIO program, said Dalia Hernandez, the president of a professional association that works closely with these programs. Informally, colleges know that some students in these programs lack legal status. Now campus TRIO officials are grappling with the president’s order and wondering if they are going to have to start documenting citizenship.  
Although non-citizens aren’t eligible for federal financial aid, in 2022 the education department granted California special permission to enroll them in TRIO programs’ academic services through September 2026.  
Now the administration is revoking that permission. 
In a Zoom webinar a few days after the education department’s announcement, Hernandez’s organization, the Western Association of Educational Opportunity Personnel, told college leaders that they could keep serving students in their programs, regardless of immigration status. However, moving forward, schools would need to reject any suspected non-citizen, she said. The federal education department has yet to provide any additional guidance about how to interpret the TRIO policy change. 
“I’ve been in 1,000 meetings talking about every executive order that comes out, and every meeting is like, ‘Well, we don’t know what’s going to happen and it’s probably going to get blocked by a federal judge, so just hold on,’” said Brian Boomer, the director of grants at the West Hills Community College District in California’s Central Valley. “This was a little different because they actually gave a directive.”
Outside of California, it’s easy to see why some might argue these federal dollars should only serve U.S. citizens, Boomer said. But in Fresno and Kings counties, where his community college district is located, he said many immigrants are embedded in the community, work in nearby farms, and send their children to the region’s schools and colleges. “That’s the population you serve,” he said. “Our area feeds the country.”
Coalinga College is one of the two schools in his district. More than 70% of its students identify as Latino, and many are current or former farmworkers or children of farmworkers. The college’s largest TRIO program, called Student Support Services, has just under 200 low-income, first generation students enrolled, said Lissette Padilla, who oversees it. 
Some of those students likely don’t have legal status, she said, but it’s not clear how many. 
A ‘heartbreaking’ change for one student
As a low-income student with a learning disability and the first in his family to attend college, “J” knew he needed help navigating Oxnard College, a community college in Ventura County. He applied to one of the TRIO programs in 2021 but he said he was rejected because program administrators suspected he wasn’t a U.S. citizen. CalMatters has agreed to withhold his name because he fears drawing attention to his legal status. 
“I thought this was going to be for all first-generation students,” he said. “I felt like I was abandoned.”  
Two years later, after the state got special permission from the federal government, the director of the program reached out to J again, this time to encourage him to reapply. As part of one of the TRIO programs, J got one-on-one guidance with campus counselors who helped ensure that he was on track to meet his academic goals and transfer to a four-year university. The TRIO staff also took him on trips to visit various colleges, including Cal State Northridge, Chico State, and Cal State Long Beach. 
Last summer, he enrolled at Cal State Channel Islands, ready to pursue a bachelor’s degree. Many Cal State and University of California campuses offer TRIO programs to their students, but Channel Islands isn’t one of them. “It’s very disappointing,” he said because he was hoping to stay enrolled in one of the TRIO programs.
Even if the university began offering TRIO programs, he won’t qualify if colleges enforce the Trump administration’s policy change. J said it’s “heartbreaking” that students without legal status will no longer have that opportunity to enroll. 
In the first few days after the Trump administration’s announcement, schools received little guidance about how to respond and looked to Hernandez, the regional association president, for guidance. She said her interpretation is that TRIO programs are only required to evaluate a student’s eligibility when they first enroll. As a result, she said schools do not need to kick out any students who are currently enrolled, but they shouldn’t register any new students who may lack legal status. 
She also recommended that schools revise their intake forms so that students can only identify as male or female. “We’re protecting the programs and the funding that we have,” said Hernandez, referring to Trump’s executive order on gender identity, which prohibits the U.S. government from recognizing gender expansive terms such as non-binary. 
Padilla said she’s concerned that Coalinga College may, at some point, need to pull counseling services away from students without legal status who are in the program. She said the contingency plan is to move those students into similar programs that are funded by the state and which don’t ask for proof of citizenship. 
Lizette Navarette, the president of Woodland Community College near Sacramento, said she was wary of the initial decision to allow students without legal status to receive services through a federal program. “There was some concern about how safe the student data would be because it’s a federal grant,” she said. For over a year now, her college has been directing those students to state programs, which she said often have more capacity and which don’t share data with the federal government. 
Will TRIO get cut?
In 2021, the national association for TRIO administrators, the Cal State University system, the UC system, the California Department of Education and more than 80 other organizations signed a letter addressed to the U.S. Department of Education, calling on it to allow students without legal status to enroll in TRIO programs. 
But over the years, support has waned. 
The federal government allowed California to expand access to TRIO programs as part of a pilot, which was slated to end next year. In 2023 and 2024, when the U.S. Department of Education discussed expanding access in other states and in a more permanent way, California’s institutions once again voiced their support. But the national association was silent, said Antoinette Flores, the director of a higher education research team at the think tank New America. 
She said the association, known as the Council for Opportunity in Education, fears that allowing students without legal status to participate could elicit more scrutiny from the Trump administration and put the entire program at risk. The association didn’t respond to CalMatters’ request for comment. 
“We have had, over the years, very strong bipartisan support for federal TRIO programs,” said Hernandez, who also serves as the regional representative of the national association. But she acknowledged that nothing is certain. “There is rhetoric from the current administration about dismantling these federal programs.”
She said her regional association still wants to include all low-income, first-generation students in TRIO programs, including students without legal status, but other colleges and universities outside the state may have a different perspective. “California is one of the very few states in the country that has resources and support earmarked for undocumented students and youth. Others may not have as much.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101023-West-Hills-College-LV_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772
,California,2025-04-17 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles travelers will finally get to ride Metro rail to LAX. Soon. Probably.,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/train-metro-los-angeles-airport/,"For Angelenos, the most terrifying words in the English language are ""Hey, can you give me a ride to LAX?"" After decades, the airport will soon connect to LA Metro. Probably.","Ten million people live in Los Angeles County, and the region’s Metro rail system carried 300 million riders last year. Los Angeles International Airport is one of the world’s busiest and most important, with more than 76 million passengers in 2024. But try taking a train to or from any place in that county to that airport. They don’t link up and never have — though, that may at last be about to change.
Why there is no train to the airport is anybody’s guess. 
Did the taxi industry maneuver to block it many years ago? Did nearby neighborhoods quietly object? Did land-use planners simply not think of it? Everyone has a theory, but the failure to bring a train to the airport is one of those municipal mishaps whose rationale is lost to time.
Even the region’s most deeply rooted leaders are at a loss to explain it. 
Take Janice Hahn, for one. Not many people have a richer political history in Los Angeles than Hahn, who is both a county supervisor and the chair of LA Metro, the regional rail authority. Hahn served on the Los Angeles City Council and in Congress before being elected to the county board. Her father was a council member and legendary supervisor. Her brother was the mayor. Even she doesn’t know how LA’s train system managed to bypass an international airport.
Former County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, another of the region’s political veterans, acknowledged that the decision to route the Green Line just beyond the periphery of the airport “made no sense at all.” In his memoir, Yaroslavsky calls the project “the Moses Line” because a traveler can see the Promised Land from it but can’t quite enter it.
Kenneth Hahn, Janice Hahn’s father, helped spearhead the region’s first light rail. He imagined it someday reaching the airport. That was in 1980.
Forty-five years, tens of millions of dollars and countless neighborhood and government meetings since, the rail network has expanded, sweeping across Los Angeles County. But not to LAX.
It’s not like there’s no demand for such a connection. Traffic at the airport has been a dreaded fact of Los Angeles life for longer than most people here have lived. The horseshoe that connects the terminals backs up at all hours of the day, and trips to and from the airport grind to a standstill as soon as your car enters the loop.
Years ago, Hahn was dedicating a project at the airport, and she jokingly reflected on President Reagan’s famous observation that “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”
The equivalent in Los Angeles, Hahn said, were, “Hey, can you give me a ride to LAX?”
Local officials have devised a host of stop-gap solutions over the years. Passengers can link up to fly-away shuttles that connect the airport to downtown and the San Fernando Valley. The airport has a special lot for rideshares, and buses connect LAX to different parts of town.
But for any passenger used to traveling the world — anyone who has walked from the terminal to the Metro stop at Reagan National in Washington or experienced the ease of transit access in airports from San Francisco to Paris to Hong Kong — LAX is an outlier.
Why not just extend the train? The obstacles range from cost to local opposition. LAX has strained to expand its traffic while keeping the neighborhood around it pacified. Noise restrictions, quieter jets, traffic controls have all helped, but the managers of the airport have waged a protracted campaign to keep some people happy — even at the expense of the larger region’s convenience.
For years, officials were paralyzed by the fear of litigation, afraid of even uttering the words “airport expansion.” They would talk instead of “airport modernization.” Running a light rail through the area generated reflexive opposition.
And so, airline passengers step off flights, collect their bags and schlep across the airport to the rideshare lot. Or hop on a bus to take them to a train, as they have for generations.
That may be about to change. Soon. Probably.
Two major projects are underway that together should end the mysterious gap in the transportation network of America’s second-largest city. LAX is constructing a so-called People Mover intended to whisk travelers around the airport, and Metro is extending the K Line to connect with a newly built LAX/Metro Transit Center just outside the airport. 
Together, they are designed to finally close the gap in the region’s transit network, so that a person could board a train in, say, Hollywood or the Valley or Pasadena and ride it to the new LAX transit center and board a people mover to take them to their terminal. 
This would happen all without transferring to a bus or hailing a cab or hitting up a friend for a ride.
It’s tempting — but slightly premature — to declare this long struggle over. The twin project was scheduled to open in December, but Angelenos know it hasn’t. The construction in and around the airport continues. Now the target date is December 2025, and Hahn is optimistic about hitting that one.
Even with the delay, it would plug the hole in the transportation donut well in time for its international coming-out party, the 2028 Olympic Games. “This is a big one if you really want to showcase the city,” Hahn said.
International travelers expect to be able to move about a city on public transit, and that starts when they land. The train service to the airport, she added, will “put Los Angeles International Airport into the international airport club.”
And so construction continues, winding closer and closer to the day that has eluded generations of transit leaders in this city. It’s fallen short so often and for so long that it will be hard to believe until it actually opens. But Hahn is allowing herself a flicker of optimism.
“I do think,” she said last week, “this long nightmare is going to come to an end.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/121922_LAX_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

(Photo courtesy of New Energy Equities)Minnesota’s electric grid is cleaner than ever, and the state is well positioned to take advantage of emerging energy industries, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said Thursday.
But federal policy chaos — driven by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and general preference for fossil fuels — as well as shifting consumer behavior and lagging implementation of environmentally friendly technologies hint at bigger challenges ahead for one of the fastest-growing sectors of the state’s economy, analysts and industry representatives said at a Monday press briefing.
“Certainly there’s a lot going on right now…that makes predicting the future and [even] predicting today a little bit unsteady,” said Becky Wacker, director of energy services sales in North America for Trane Technologies.
The U.S. power sector saw a “dramatic transformation” in recent years thanks to falling costs for wind and solar power, state clean energy policies and long-term clean power purchase commitments by tech giants like Amazon and Google, said Derrick Flakoll, Bloomberg NEF senior policy associate. In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.
More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spurred investment in nascent clean-tech industries like low-emissions hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, which airlines and jet manufacturers see as key to their long-term sustainability goals. CEEM’s factsheet touted the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit, which pays $1.50 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced and sold in Minnesota through June 2030, and a biofuels startup’s plan to build a $5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant in Moorhead that could eventually produce nearly 200 million gallons of fuel each year.
These investments “now face significant market risk” due to the Trump administration’s hefty — and self-contradictory — import tariffs, and the very real possibility that Congress narrows or repeals key IRA tax credits later this year.
“The fate of this is hanging in the balance (due to) a lot of political and economic factors,” Flakoll said.
State-level policy looks steadier in the near term, Wacker said. That could be a silver lining for HVAC and refrigeration businesses like Trane, which has rebranded itself as a leader in building efficiency and decarbonization. 
“A number of states are staying pretty consistent in how they’re approaching things,” she said.
Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. A 2021 law that boosted utility-led efficiency programs saved residents and businesses more than $307 million over two years, CEEM said.
But Minnesota’s ambitious efficiency and sustainability policies haven’t translated into action to the extent seen in nation-leading states and cities, Wacker said. She nodded to Washington state, which will begin holding larger buildings to strict sustainability standards next year; and New York City, where Local Law 97 encourages landlords to swap out creaky boilers for efficient heat pumps.
On electric vehicle uptake, Minnesota lags the national trendline. New registrations fell 44% from 2023 to 2024, slipping below 10,000, as EV sales grew 6.5% nationally, CEEM found. Minnesota had 65,679 plug-in EVs on its roads in November 2024, according to CEEM — less than 2% of total light-duty vehicle registrations. Plug-in vehicles accounted for 1 in 4 vehicle registrations last year in California, the top U.S. EV market, though the total share of EV registrations there remains far lower.
And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.
“That’s a little different from past years, when we had a combination of wind and solar [added to the grid],” said Cathy Liebowitz, director of member engagement for CEEM. 
Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now. Most of the windiest areas already have working turbines; solar farm construction costs are rapidly declining; and the massive scale of the typical wind project can complicate projects, he said.
State lawmakers passed a major energy permitting reform bill last year that could accelerate approvals for large-scale wind and solar installations, but the law won’t take effect until July.
Despite the wind slowdown, CEEM’s latest factsheet had some qualified good news for Minnesota utility customers. The average consumer paid 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, up 1.2% from 2023 and 30% from 2015, CEEM said. But that’s lower than the 2024 national average of 12.99 cents per kilowatt-hour — up 2.4% from 2023.
Minnesotans should blame the aging electric grid and volatile natural gas prices for steadily rising electricity rates, rather than wind and solar farms, Liebowitz and Flakoll said.
Transmission and distribution grid infrastructure account for 63% of the $45 billion Xcel Energy plans to invest through 2029, compared with 11% for renewable power, the utility said in November. 
“The grid is old in general, so updating it regardless of whether it’s clean or not is something states are working on,” Liebowitz said.
Meanwhile, the actual cost of generating power is closely correlated with natural gas prices because gas-fired power plants tend to be the “last” units called on to meet demand, Flakoll said.
“If you rely on natural gas at the margin, you are going to affect bills,” he said. “To say renewables are the driving force behind these electricity rate increases would be overly simplistic and probably not true.”

(Photo by Getty Images)WARNING: This column may be hazardous to the comfort level of many readers. It’s easy to get lost in the bureaucratic weeds of the many agencies at the center of the world of Career and Technical Education (CTE), as I have in my research. Still, please give the column a try. We must struggle to understand the serious growing pains that threaten CTE’s success. 
The Career and Technical Education (CTE) provisions in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future are, arguably, the most important but most neglected part of the landmark legislation. They are intended to provide optional pathways for students to be well-prepared for well-paying jobs as well as for college.
The focus is on Apprenticeships and Career Counseling. And expanding them should be a slam dunk. No one’s against CTE, not even Trump. Students want good jobs and employers want skilled workers, and the Blueprint goes all out to connect them.
Unfortunately, implementation of Apprenticeships and Career Counseling is moving more slowly than it should. And regrettably, the General Assembly did little about it, with two exceptions noted later.
The CTE program can’t succeed without two major improvements. One is to simplify and strengthen lines of authority and accountability among the incredible number of bureaucracies that populate the CTE universe. The second is lack of resources.
Understand first that the CTE goals are extremely ambitious:
Apprenticeships. By school year 2030-31, 45% of public graduates should complete the high school portion of a registered apprenticeship or other work credential.
However, compare the 45% goal with the fact that in 2021 less than 15% completed the requirements. At the same time, the Apprenticeship program is saddled with problems. Among them: not enough employers; not enough funding; administrative hurdles within school systems; and interagency stumbling blocks.

Lawmakers this year did provide $5 million additional funding per year for two years, but the administrative hurdles remain.
Career Counseling. The Blueprint requires every middle and high school student to receive annually individualized career counseling about job pathways. But here too, daunting obstacles stand in the way of a sky-high goal.
There is tension and confusion in the relative roles of school systems and workforce development boards under the state Department of Labor. Also, the goal of annual individualized counseling is impossible given the woefully limited funds to hire counselors. (Notwithstanding that the General Assembly extended current funding for two years.)
An idea, advanced by Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s), is to amend the Blueprint to follow the Swiss model. It provides middle school students with broad exposure but not, as with high school students, individualized guidance. (Rosapepe’s opinions deserve attention. He is the most knowledgeable and dogged voice in Annapolis for CTE.)
The good news is that the involved agencies recognize the problems in the Career Counseling program. The bad news is that there are way too many such agencies. The list includes the Blueprint Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB), the state education department (MSDE), local school systems, state and local workforce development boards, the state CTE Committee and Apprenticeship 2030 Commission, and community colleges.
That is a helluva lot of cooks in the CTE kitchen. The Kirwan Commission intended the CTE Committee under the Governor’s Workforce Development Board to be the executive chef. Its position, influenced by Rosapepe, was that workforce development boards know infinitely more about job markets than school systems; also implicit was a lack of confidence in the competence of MSDE and local school systems.
But, in my view, Apprenticeships and Career Counseling are markedly different in how school systems relate to them. Apprenticeship interactions with employers are beyond the normal orbit of school systems; counseling is a routine school function, and should be entrusted to schools, as advocated by the Public School Superintendents’ Association. The key is for MSDE to develop smart standards, provide strong technical assistance and conduct tough monitoring, including assessing whether there is sufficient collaboration between school systems and workforce development boards.
Rosapepe disagrees. He believes that workforce boards will be stronger and more accountable managers.
What isn’t in dispute is that implementation is falling far short. The MSDE 2024 Blueprint Implementation Plan reveals that CTE is generally lagging. The CTE Committee acknowledges “it will take several years of building programming and capacity.”
Finally, not to pile on but there is a big underlying and sometimes imperceptible hurdle: The widespread perception that CTE is a dumping ground for poorly performing students. John McWhorter, a regular New York Times op-ed contributor, has written: “The idea that in our society the ordinary trajectory after high school is to attend another four years of school has become arbitrary, purposeless and even absurd.” Nonetheless, the absurdity is drummed into the heads of parents, students, and even some educators.
Bravo readers (good job!) if you’ve managed to endure this foray into the deep weeds of CTE. It’s worth it: CTE is indispensable to the future of large numbers of our students, and much more must be urgently done to raise awareness and political support. Its potential, envisioned in the Blueprint, is at great risk.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1461679042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

(Courtesy of Youth Futures)When Shi Alex was couch surfing as a 17-year-old while facing an abusive situation at home, she found Kristen Mitchell, who forever changed the trajectory of her life. 
It started with hot meals. Then she started going to support groups. 
“She always gave me positive regard, no matter what,” Alex said of Mitchell, who at the time was volunteering for a youth outreach program in Ogden. “They just gave me unconditional support, and always made me feel like I was welcome to be there. So that kept me coming back, and eventually it snowballed.” 
Alex, now 29, has spent the last eight years working for a nonprofit that Mitchell co-founded soon after they met. That nonprofit is now known as Youth Futures, which became Utah’s first licensed homeless residential support temporary youth shelter in 2015, starting with 14 temporary overnight beds in downtown Ogden.

Now, after 10 years, Youth Futures also operates overnight youth shelters in two southern Utah cities — St. George and Cedar City — offering not just a safe place to sleep for at-risk kids ages 12 to 18, but also provides meals, clothing, hygiene supplies, laundry services, computer access, and case management every day of the week. The nonprofit aims to reunify families wherever possible, but first and foremost seeks to help kids stay healthy so they can not only survive, but thrive.
“On a day-to-day basis, they’re just keeping you alive,” Alex said. “And if you’re not alive, you can’t recover, no matter what you’re going through. The open doors that they have are keeping so many young people alive and giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential.”
The nonprofit now serves an estimated 60 to 80 kids a day between all of its programs — or about 700 kids a year. 
“The reason we opened was to reduce suicidality and help runaway homeless youth,” Mitchell said. 
But Mitchell told Utah News Dispatch she’s worried that Youth Futures is facing an uncertain future. 
Under President Donald Trump’s administration and federal cuts approved by Congress, nonprofits like hers are facing a chaotic and precarious landscape. Federal funds that Youth Futures relies heavily on are either frozen or potentially on the chopping block. 
Mitchell said she’s stressing on a daily basis about whether she’ll have to cut services or make other “really hard decisions.” 
“The real risk is putting kiddos on the street,” she said. 
To Alex — who has experienced firsthand what Youth Futures can do to help vulnerable Utah kids — the potential of federal funding cuts could threaten not just youth homeless shelter options, but also life-saving services. 
“It would just be so heartbreaking,” she said. “I’m not the first or the last kid that this place has helped. So to have the uncertainty turn into a termination of services, there’s so many kids that are going to have to just rough it without the support. And that’s horrifying.” 
Uncertainty around federal funds for homeless youth
National homeless youth advocates have warned of “very strong uncertainty,” Mitchell said, about whether three-year federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) grants will be reauthorized this year in October. 
Faith groups, advocates urge Utah Legislature to fund operations for new family shelter

“This is the largest portion of our operating budget, and without it, it’s going to get really challenging to operate — if we can even continue,” Mitchell said. “If we don’t have enough funds to continue, we’re going to have to cut services (or) staff. And the majority of our staff lives paycheck to paycheck.” 
Under the RHYA Act, Mitchell said her nonprofit receives about $750,000 a year, which equates to about $250,000 for each of Youth Futures’ three locations, which she said each cost about $1.2 million to run. Those federal funds account for about 60% of her operating budget. Donations fund about 30% to 40%, she said. 
RHYA’s appropriations have technically expired, but have previously continued to receive funding under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Workforce. It’s not yet clear whether those authorizations will continue this year. 
Last month, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to fund the government until Sept. 30, but cut $13 billion to non-defense programs and eliminated fiscal year 2025 earmark funding. That included $40 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Children and Family Services programs, according to the National Network for Youth, an organization that advocates for youth homeless service providers in Washington, D.C. 
Because the bill didn’t specify how the cuts should be implemented, “it will be up to the federal agencies to decide what programs some of the broad cuts that the bill dictates will come from,” the advocacy group said in a March 14 post, leading to uncertainty for programs including RHYA. 
“Programs important to youth experiencing homelessness, such as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, were not explicitly mentioned in the bill,” the post said. “At this time, it’s difficult to say what that may indicate.”

National youth homeless advocates have been urging Congress to pass the Runway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act to reauthorize RHYA’s funds, but it’s not clear if or when it will be considered. 
While Mitchell waits for news about RHYA, other federal funds have already been frozen and taken a bite out of her budget — though not as big of a hit as if RHYA funds aren’t renewed. Phase 42 of the Federal Emergency Food & Shelter funds are frozen, holding up roughly $25,000 to $30,000 that Youth Futures relies on to pay for shelter and meals. Mitchell said she’s not sure how, but she’s working to try to find ways to fill the gap, which could include turning to lines of credit, which would only be a temporary solution. 
“We already fundraise like crazy,” she said, adding that Youth Futures relies heavily on those federal funds, and without them she worries about leaving vulnerable kids without help. “We’re (on) a very tight budget. We run a scrappy organization. I would love it if we didn’t have to be that way, but we have low overhead. And without (federal funds), it really risks our kids.” 
Youth Futures’ funding uncertainty comes at a time when the nonprofit is hitting its 10-year anniversary, having served what Mitchel estimates is more than 6,000 kids. 
“We’re trying to celebrate while having this really big concern for funding, which is extremely stressful,” she said. “We are just really looking for other donations, other contributions, gifts, to help us not have to rely so heavily on those funds.”
What’s at stake
Most of the kids Youth Futures serves come from poverty, Mitchell said, with about a third coming from families that are dealing with financial insecurity or homelessness. She said the nonprofit also helps “kids who have been rejected, kicked out, asked to leave by their parents.” 
“We’ve even seen kids who are dropped off on our doorstep by their parents who … they just don’t know what else to do. They’ve given up,” she said. 
Others come from “family discord” situations, she said, whether that means “religious discord or LGBTQ discord,” or disagreements over family rules and boundaries. 
For a nonprofit that seeks to help kids in areas off the Wasatch Front, like in southern Utah where homeless services for youth can otherwise be scant, Mitchell said she worries that if Youth Futures has to reduce its services, that could mean leaving kids in these areas on the street.

“And that really sucks to have kids not have a place to be,” she said. “We often find kids in caves, in sheds, doubled up in households where there’s way too many people. Kids often getting involved in trafficking to survive. … They’re doing some really rough things, sexual favors and those kinds of things to either get money or a place to sleep or a meal. I mean, those are just terrible things. We really don’t want to go back to that.” 
Alex is not only a former client of Youth Futures, but she’s also now an employee. She worked her way up from a youth advocate, to a street outreach worker, to a case manager, to program manager of the Ogden shelter. She then went on to work in finance for the nonprofit where she wrote grant applications for the very federal dollars now at stake, before working in her current role as a quality assurance analyst, where she writes reports for grants and crunches data for the nonprofit. 
She’s also furthering her education. Alex said she’s on track to finish her master’s in social work. 
But now, Alex said she’s worried about what federal funding cuts could mean for not just herself, but also her colleagues. She said the cloud of uncertainty is causing “so much stress.” 
“The employees are angels. Absolute angels,” she said. “They’re dealing with really difficult situations. And they’re so good at it. So having that specific skill set, we need to fund people to provide those services. And if we don’t have it, everyone will be heartbroken.”

Jasmin Hernandez-Alamillo, the community health coordinator for the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, a group that advocates for immigrants, attended the meeting and said he felt “utter devastation” at the vote.
“They are not recognizing human beings as human beings,” he said. “That makes me extremely upset because I come from immigrants. My family are immigrants. I work with immigrants every single day, and they do not see us as humans.”
The committee approved Kitchens’ bill one week after the committee hosted a public hearing in which members heard from several who spoke against the legislation, with one pastor telling the committee it violates Christian values, and a second person saying it could prevent people from obtaining the necessary paperwork to bring their children back to their home country in the event they are deported.
The Senate approved the legislation in February, after the body removed language related to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, that forced the public to assist slave catchers return people to bondage to the south.
The bill offers several exceptions for people who are transporting people who are not legally authorized to live in the U.S. into Alabama, such as attorneys transporting clients to different immigration facilities or educators escorting their students for a school related activity.
Members of the House Judiciary Committee approved other exemptions to the crime of human smuggling as part of an amendment.

The move comes after President Joe Biden, days before leaving office, instructed the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make the relief efforts permanent.  
Critics of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) COVID relief policy, which allows the agency to front payments on behalf of troubled borrowers, say it’s keeping unqualified borrowers in their homes without making a payment for two to three years, and delaying scarce inventory from going on the market. 
COVID-era mortgage relief, initiated by Trump in 2020 and extended by Biden in 2021, “has created another subprime housing bubble and put taxpayers at risk. Trump should end it,” says a February editorial in the Wall Street Journal. “Under the guise of Covid relief, the Biden administration masked the growing troubles in the housing market by paying off borrowers and mortgage servicers to prevent foreclosures. Of the 52,531 FHA loans last year that went seriously delinquent within their first year, only nine resulted in foreclosure.”

Nationwide one in every 1,515 housing units had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2025, reports ATTOM Data, a real estate analyst.  Nevada ranked third in the nation for the highest rate of foreclosure filings (behind Delaware and Illinois) with one filing for every 874 housing units. 
By comparison, in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, one in 14 Nevada homes received a default notice. 
‘Canary in the coal mine’
The national delinquency rate for all mortgages, which topped 10% during the Great Recession, has been rising for more than a year and edged up to 3.53% in February, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a housing finance company. 
FHA mortgages, which make up less than 15% of all active home loans, but allow higher debt ratios and smaller down payments than other loans, accounted for 90% of the 131,000 home loans that went delinquent last year, ICE reports. 
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, tweeted last month the FHA delinquency rate is “Leading Indicator #2,” behind only consumer confidence on his recession watch, calling it “a proverbial canary in the coal mine…” 
“Not that the financial troubles of FHA borrowers are enough to push the economy into recession. Indeed, high and middle-income mortgage borrowers are having no trouble making their payments at this time – the gap between the FHA delinquency rate and those on Fannie and Freddie loans has never been as large,” Zandi wrote. “But if the economy is headed for trouble, it is FHA borrowers who will signal it first. And they are.”
FHA loans, which are targeted to low-credit, first-time buyers, are a popular option for Nevada borrowers. In 2024, FHA served 766,942 new borrowers nationwide, including just under 11,000 in Nevada, according to its annual report. 
Additionally, some 3,500 Nevadans have received assistance via the FHA relief program in the last three years, according to the website for the Nevada Affordable Home Assistance Corporation’s (NAHAC), which administers relief programs for some 80 lenders. 
‘Extend and pretend’ 
The COVID relief program allows FHA to make payments, called partial claims, (‘partial’ because the payment is not covering the entire debt) on behalf of delinquent borrowers, and add the amount fronted by the government to the back end of the loan, interest free. The FHA payments on behalf of borrowers cannot exceed 30% of a loan’s unpaid principal balance. 
“Consider a borrower who misses five $4,000 monthly mortgage payments,” says the WSJ editorial. “The servicer will add the $20,000 in missed payments to the mortgage and reduce monthly payments by $1,000 for three years—adding another $36,000 to their mortgage. So the borrower is $56,000 deeper in debt, though with no additional interest.”
Mortgage expert John Comiskey projects the FHA “made ~2.6 billion dollars in mortgage payments from these stand alone partial claims last year.” Records analyzed by Comiskey indicate some borrowers made no payments for several years, with the FHA stepping in to bring their loans current every three to four months. 
Comiskey, who calls the effort “an abject FHA loss mitigation policy failure,” tweeted last month that about 70% of some 160,000 FHA Covid relief modifications originated during the past two years are delinquent, and about 55% are seriously delinquent.  
“The extend and pretend music is still playing for these mortgages, though that music now has an end date, and when it stops many of these mortgages will head to foreclosure,” Comiskey wrote last month. On Wednesday, the day after HUD’s announcement, he predicted the end of FHA loss mitigation “will start hitting housing transactions in early ‘26 with maybe some precursor effect late this year.”  
“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008,” says longtime Las Vegas Realtor Steve Hawks, referring to borrowers who purchased multiple properties with no-money-down loans. “They’re in trouble because they can’t afford the cost of living. The home they bought for $300,000 is now $550,000. Their property taxes and home insurance have gone up. The cost of maintenance has gone through the roof. They’re using credit cards for everyday expenses.” 
It’s unknown how many Nevada homeowners will be affected. 
“FHA does not have publicly available information on its home retention solutions by state or dollar amount,” a HUD spokesperson said via email. 
Hawks projects Nevada’s phantom inventory of homes with non-performing loans, but no public record of default, could be in the tens of thousands. 
“It’s not rocket science,” he says, adding the writing was on the wall when home prices soared and inventory dropped in 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people that were going to sell took their houses off the market,” and opted for loan modification and forbearance programs. 











“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008.”

	FHA officials contend the relief has worked, and maintain it is fronting payments on behalf of a small percentage of borrowers. The measures “have proven to be effective in helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and reduce losses,” FHA Commissioner Julia Gordan said just days before Biden left office. 
From April of 2020 through September 2024, some 1.7 million FHA borrowers took part in COVID-19 forbearance, according to the agency’s 2024 annual report to Congress. Of those, 77% were able to get back on track, either paying off their loan or becoming current on their mortgages. Some 371,000 borrowers (22%) remained in delinquency or forbearance.
As of September 2024, FHA held active mortgage insurance on 7.81 million single family mortgage loans. The share of FHA borrowers who are seriously delinquent stood at 4.15% in September 2024, a slight increase from a year ago but consistent with rates seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Of some 425,000 loss mitigation actions reported by FHA to Congress in its 2024 annual report, just under 324,000 were partial claims. 
Loan servicers receive a monetary incentive for participating in the relief program – between $500 and $1,750 every time the FHA steps up on behalf of borrowers. 
“The FHA made 556,841 ‘incentive payments’ to servicers over the past year to prevent foreclosures—nearly as many as the new mortgages it insured,” says the WSJ editorial. “Government-backed mortgage relief has become a cash cow for servicers, some of which originated the risky loans they are paid not to foreclose. Moral hazard, anyone?”
Las Vegas real estate expert Tony Ricco says he contacted an FHA lender in an attempt to buy delinquent loans but was turned down. “Why would they sell them? They’re getting paid by the federal government on non-performing loans.” 
Ricco says the level of manipulation in the housing market is preventing “true price discovery” and “is skewing housing to be unaffordable.” 
The end of FHA loss mitigation could see “some additional homes entering the market from the seller’s side as either those borrowers are forced to sell to avoid foreclosure or once the foreclosure is complete,” says Nicholas Irwin, Research Director at UNLV’s Lied Center for Real Estate. “The tricky part is that foreclosed homes become HUD homes and I don’t know how quick the process is from foreclosure to on the market.”
Additional housing supply results in downward pressure on prices, Irwin says. “How much of an effect will depend on how many folks are impacted in our area.”
Unlike 2008, when most properties were privately held, government-sponsored entities such as FHA, the Veterans Administration, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have skin in the game on about half of all mortgages.
“The government’s not going to foreclose on these people just to put them on another relief program,” Hawks said. “That’s why they’ve been letting them go for this long.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/housing-vista-ronda-aerial-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-17 09:05:48.512772

Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, speaks Tuesday, April 15, 2025, on the floor of the Alaska Senate. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A change to Alaska’s corporate income tax structure is expected to add as much as $65 million per year to the state treasury by diverting money from other states.
The Alaska Senate voted 16-4 on Tuesday to approve Senate Bill 113, which clarifies that online sales to Alaskans amount to business activity within the state.
If passed by the House and approved by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, it would be the state’s first new revenue-generating law in years.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the sponsor of the bill, said that without the change, businesses can say that the location of an online sale is a server farm or warehouse outside of the state, making it ineligible for Alaska taxation.
Passing the bill is a step toward resolving a major budget deficit, he said, adding that the change won’t have an impact on Alaskans and isn’t a tax increase. Thirty-six other states have adopted similar tax rules.
“It’s about as close as you can get to a unicorn bill to raise money for the state of Alaska,” he said during a news conference on Tuesday.
“It’s a bill that doesn’t raise taxes on Alaskans, doesn’t raise taxes on Alaskan businesses. It’s not going to cost any more simply changing the structure of our corporate income tax. It will probably, quite frankly, shift money from other states to the state of Alaska, and so it’ll be a unicorn. It’s kind of a rarity. There’s probably not too many of these out there,” Wielechowski said.
Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage, said the bill is necessary to modernize the state’s tax system.
“You can get pretty much anything online and it comes to your door, and many of these companies that are doing business here in Alaska pay a little or no corporate income tax due due to what has become, I think, an outdated structure for how we assess companies that are primarily located out of state,” he said.
Opposition came from four Republican members of the Senate minority, including Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, who said she believes it is inappropriate to pass a new revenue measure without also considering changes to the state’s spending cap.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, also voted against the bill, saying he doubts Wielechowski’s claims and believes costs will be passed to Alaskans.
“Somewhere, somebody’s paying more money if we’re raising taxes. The businesses are not charities,” he said.
SB 113 has been referred to the House Finance Committee for further hearings.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would require local school boards to adopt a policy allowing employees and students to voluntarily pray in school.
But the committee made significant changes to HB 231, sponsored by Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, a constitutional amendment that must be approved by voters if it passes the Legislature. 
As filed, the bill required a daily prayer and specified that the prayer must reflect Judeo-Christian values. A substitute adopted by the committee removed that requirement.
“We took out the Christianity requirement, where if somebody had a different belief, it would be any of their religion,” Ingram said. “And I’m a Christian, and have been, and always will be. But I do respect other religions as well, too, and other people come into this country with different beliefs and that’s their right and opinion.”
Current law generally allows school prayer and religious studies outside of school buildings. Other changes to the bill include that prayers cannot be done in a classroom or during instructional time, and students must get parental consent to participate.
“Prayer has to go on before the school time or after school time. So they would have a room that they could pray in if the school, whatever the school board decided for them to,” he said.
The legislation also requires schools to start each day with the Pledge of Allegiance. If schools do not comply consistently with this requirement, the state superintendent must withhold 25% of state funding. The Legislature will also be authorized to withhold funding from noncompliant schools if they continue to violate the legislation.
“These kids that grow up these days don’t understand what the flag is and what it means. And I think that’s part of the teaching,” he said.
The bill moves to the full House.

The Senate approved the bill earlier this month.
Current law makes it a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison for anyone convicted of a crime of violence, a misdemeanor charge of domestic abuse, someone subject to a protective order or someone of “unsound mind” to possess a firearm. Barfoot’s bill keeps that ban in place but adds new language to extend the ban to anyone charged with those crimes, though they cannot be convicted of possession unless first being convicted of the original crimes they were charged with.
The bill also says the ban applies to anyone convicted of a felony offense “within the previous five years.” It also bans anyone who has three felony convictions from possessing a firearm.
Those who violate the ban may be charged with a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
The bill also extends a prohibition on carrying deadly weapons “with intent to do bodily harm” to private as well as public schools. It also enhances the criminal penalties for people who shoot into a building with people, going from a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine, to a Class A felony, punishable by up to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The legislation also allows courts to deny bail to those charged with shooting into an occupied building.
The bill leaves in place the penalty for shooting into a building without people at a Class C felony.
Rep. Bryan Brinyark, R-Windham Springs, had concerns with a specific line within the legislation.
‘“A person of ‘unsound mind’, and that is just so vague to me,” he said. “Who makes that decision, it doesn’t break that down. That gives me a little bit of concern but is a good bill. I appreciate what you are doing.”

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Despite growing concerns about an economic downturn, Nevada lawmakers are considering legislation to adjust the commerce tax threshold, a change that would result in less revenue coming into the state.
Nevada businesses are currently subject to the commerce tax on gross revenue above $4 million a year. Assembly Bill 276, sponsored by Republican Assemblymembers P.K. O’Neill and Jill Dickman, would make the threshold a moving target by tying it to inflation and the consumer price index.
The Assembly Revenue Committee gave the bill a hearing in mid-March but took no action until a Friday deadline day The bill passed the committee on a voice vote, with four Democrats opposing.
Expected revenue loss from AB276 would be a miniscule part of the state’s overall budget, but all revenue conversations this legislative session are fraught with anxiety.
Nevada’s Economic Forum in December projected a conservative forecast of $12.4 billion in tax revenue over the next two fiscal years, but acknowledged that Trump’s more grandiose campaign promises — specifically tariffs and mass immigration — had the potential to significantly change the economic outlook. The Economic Forum will meet on May 1 and may adjust that forecast up or down.
“With the economic challenge we’re facing, and the current state of the economy, and the upcoming Economic Forum expectations, I will be voting no on bills abating or negating revenue, which includes this bill,” said Assemblymember Venicia Considine prior to the committee vote on AB276.
Republicans have largely downplayed the possibility of Nevada facing deep financial cuts. Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus at the beginning of the legislative session suggested the state can just “find ways to spend less,” and Gov. Joe Lombardo this month said the state will simply “make adjustments on the fly.”
O’Neill during the bill’s hearing in March called it “fair and effective” because it ensures the commerce tax reflects economic conditions. He and Dickman both served in the Legislature in 2015 when the commerce tax was passed. Dickman voted against it. O’Neill voted for it.
O’Neill said that negotiations at the time focused on ensuring that small businesses were not impacted. He argued that, with time and inflation, businesses the Legislature did not intend to include are now being subject to the tax.
The argument was met with some skepticism from several Democrats on the committee.
“Four million dollars still seems like a pretty large capital business,” remarked Assemblywoman Erica Roth, a Democrat from Reno. Roth also voted against advancing the bill out of committee.
Michael Nakamoto, chief principal deputy fiscal analyst for the Legislature’s nonpartisan staff, noted that 8,226 taxpayers paid $341.1 million in commerce tax in fiscal year 2024. 
The average three-year inflation rate preceding that tax year was 5%. If the threshold proposed in AB276 were in effect, 145 of those businesses would not have had to pay the commerce tax, while the remainder would have only had to pay on gross revenue above $4.2 million instead of $4 million. 
That would have resulted in approximately $1.6 million less in revenue for the state, according to Nakamoto.
Supporters of the bill include the Nevada Trucking Association, the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association, and the Vegas Chamber.
Assemblymember Danielle Gallant, a Republican from Henderson, said during the bill’s hearing that she supports the bill — “something’s better than nothing” — and asked the bill sponsors if they’d contemplated something “more aggressive.”
“If I had my way, I’d take the tax out but it has become part of our budget,” said O’Neill in his response, adding with the bill he is attempting to find a simple and succinct way to move forward with a tax that was heavily negotiated a decade ago.
The bill would not lower the threshold in the event of deflation. Nakamoto commented that, were there to be three years of negative inflation, the state likely “would have bigger problems to deal with.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PKONeill-scaled-e1744841770548-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-04-17 08:05:10.266526

Honolulu and Phoenix tied for the lowest effective rate (0.37%), followed by Nashville (0.48%), Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, (both 0.48%). 
Nevada has the ninth lowest property tax rate in the nation among states. Nevada’s 790,939 single-family homes have an average value of $595,116 and an average annual property tax bill of $2,856 – a .48% effective tax rate. 
Nevada property tax is calculated via a complicated formula based on assessed value, rather than market value. Local governments have long complained that the state’s 3% cap on increases in assessed value on residential property, and 8% cap on assessed value increases in commercial property values, render municipalities challenged to provide basic services, such as fire services and education. Efforts to tweak the complicated formula have failed. 
States with the lowest taxes are in the southern and western United States, ATTOM reports. 
Hawaii had the lowest property tax rate (0.33%), followed by Idaho, Arizona, and Alabama ( all at 0.41%), and Delaware (0.43%).
Utah came in sixth (0.45%), followed by Tennessee (0.46%), West Virginia (0.47%), Nevada (0.48%), and Wyoming (0.49%).
Tax rates in the Northwest U.S. are the highest, thanks to more valuable homes and higher tax rates, according to ATTOM’s report. 
Illinois has the highest rate in the nation (1.87%), followed by New Jersey (1.59%), Connecticut (1.48%), Nebraska (1.32%), and Ohio (1.31%).
New Jersey has the highest average tax bill at $10,135, followed by Connecticut ($8,402), New Hampshire ($7,723), Massachusetts ($7,720), and California ($7,131).

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s next governor may inherit a new property tax cut program aimed at seniors, but the candidates don’t all embrace it as is.
Some of the 11 candidates hoping to become our next chief executive say income limits for the program — called Stay NJ — are too generous. Others worry the state’s uncertain fiscal outlook makes the program unfeasible unless it’s revamped. One candidate, Republican Bill Spadea, called Stay NJ a “gimmick” that should be eliminated outright.
“We cannot continue with smoke and mirrors that shift the tax burden from one group to another while calling it a tax cut,” Spadea said in a statement from his campaign.
Democratic lawmakers have been promising Stay NJ for years, saying it will be essential to keep senior citizens from fleeing to states with lower taxes. But budget experts have issued private and public warnings about the program’s price tag, which is expected to top $1 billion annually.
“The state just can’t afford to pay for it,” Richard Keevey, a former state budget director and comptroller, told the New Jersey Monitor.
StayNJ was signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy in 2023, but it is not scheduled to begin delivering payments to eligible taxpayers until 2026. The program will offer homeowners 65 and over tax credits to make up for half of their property tax bills, capped at $6,500. Homeowners must make less than $500,000 annually to qualify.
Stay NJ payments could go out just as a new governor takes office in January. Murphy, a Democrat, cannot seek a third term this November, and six Democrats and five Republicans are running to succeed him.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, has called Stay NJ “inherently flawed and regressive.” In a statement from his campaign, Baraka said it “must be overhauled or dismissed,” and took aim at the program’s half-a-million-dollar income limit. 
“We need to direct government resources toward lifting all boats, not just those already floating comfortably. That means capping rents, building more housing, and investing in real solutions for affordability across the board. Our state budget should reflect our values: working people, not the wealthy, should be first in line for help,” he said.
Two of Baraka’s Democratic rivals — Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Rep. Mikie Sherrill — noted that statutory language bars the state from issuing Stay NJ payments if certain fiscal goals are not met, like maintaining a surplus that is at least 12% of annual spending (lawmakers could override that provision, and did last year).
Speaking at a press conference in Edison this week, Fulop said “of course we’re not going to stand in the way of a 50% tax reduction for residents” if the state finds a way to fund Stay NJ while keeping its surplus above 12%. But the more likely outcome, he said, is that the program won’t work.
Fulop has proposed either restructuring Stay NJ by lowering the income threshold to $150,000 and making the award a flat amount based on income rather than a percentage of property taxes paid, or implementing a new program to provide all homeowners with a single tax credit that limits a homeowner’s property taxes “to an affordable percentage of their income.”
“We’re going to clean that up to make sure there’s real property tax reform for residents here throughout New Jersey,” he said.
Sherrill told reporters in Bloomfield last month that she thinks StayNJ is a “great program” for seniors. But in a statement from her campaign on Wednesday, she noted the state’s budget issues.
“We have no way to know what state revenues will look like in 12 to 15 months or how much needed federal funding will be ripped away by Trump. However, there are things we must do like fully fund the pension system and protecting direct property tax relief is of equal importance. It is the most direct way our state government can create affordability for New Jerseyans,” Sherrill said.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) has pledged to cut all New Jerseyans’ property tax bills by a dramatic 15%. Gottheimer in a statement from his campaign said he supports Stay NJ, but wants to add additional tax relief, including a $1,000 “senior bonus” for seniors who have lived in New Jersey for at least a decade before turning 70 and an annual tax rebate for renters.
“I’m the only candidate with a tax cut plan that meets our pension obligations, tackles our structural deficit, and is fully paid for without cutting the important programs and services Jersey families and seniors rely on,” he said.
Democrat Sean Spiller, president of the statewide teachers union, said he supports StayNJ. Spiller said in a statement from his campaign that he wants to streamline the state’s multiple tax credit programs and make sure benefits get to people who need them most “without the challenging layers of bureaucracy and redundancies.” Stay NJ benefits would be paid out only if homeowners do not already see their tax bill cut in half by the existing Anchor and senior freeze tax relief programs.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, announced Wednesday he wants to slash the income limit for Stay NJ to $250,000 and eliminate income tax for seniors 65 and up with annual incomes of $250,000 or less. He calls his plan “Stay NJ Plus.”
“Our seniors deserve the peace of mind that comes with financial stability,” Sweeney said in a statement from his campaign. “By capping the Stay NJ program at $250,000, we can ensure a fair distribution of resources while continuing to support the goal of keeping our cherished residents in their homes.”
Republican Mario Kranjac, a former mayor of Englewood Cliffs, is open to keeping Stay NJ on a transitional basis,” but if elected governor, he would aim to cut spending and slash taxes, “making the State more affordable for everyone without special programs primarily designed to buy votes,” said his campaign manager, Michael Byrne.
Republican state Sen. Jon Bramnick said he supports Stay NJ and believes senior citizens deserve tax relief.
“I still support the program but if the Democrats were truly serious about reducing the property tax burden they would have started the program immediately, not three years after passage,” Bramnick said.
Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, did not respond to a request for comment.

Two different Missouri judges have now determined that he is actually innocent.
Dunn was convicted in 1991 for the fatal shooting of 14-year-old Rico Rodgers. He was also found guilty of two counts of assault and three counts of armed criminal action. The conviction was based on testimony from two teenage eyewitnesses who later recanted, stating they were pressured by police. No physical evidence ever linked Dunn to the crime scene.
In 2020, Judge William Hickle reviewed Dunn’s case during a habeas corpus proceeding. Although Missouri law at the time did not allow relief in non-death penalty cases, Hickle wrote that Dunn had met the legal threshold for innocence and that no reasonable juror would convict him based on the current evidence.
Four years later, a relatively new innocence statute was in place in Missouri, and the St. Louis Circuit Attorney used it to filed a motion to vacate Dunn’s conviction.  Judge Jason Sengheiser held an evidentiary hearing and reached the same conclusion as Hickle, finding clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence.
Dunn was released from prison on July 30, 2024, after serving 33 years.
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed the ruling, arguing that the state has a legal interest in preserving the finality of its convictions. In his filings, Bailey emphasized that overturning decades-old cases could erode public confidence in the justice system and create instability in criminal law. On Tuesday, the Missouri Supreme Court agreed, ruling that the state is an aggrieved party under Missouri’s civil appeals statute and may challenge the judgment.
The case now returns to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
The decision has drawn sharp criticism from legal advocates and reformers who believe the ruling prioritizes institutional preservation over the truth.
“Let’s be honest, this is not about public safety or accountability for the victim’s family. It is about maintaining control,” said one innocence advocate. “Two separate courts have said Christopher Dunn is innocent, yet the state continues to fight to keep him labeled a murderer.”
The family of Rico Rodgers, the 15-year-old who Dunn was convicted of killing in 1990, has waited more than 30 years for justice. But attempting to re-incarcrate someone who has been twice declared innocent will not bring peace. It further delays the opportunity to identify the true perpetrator and pursue meaningful accountability.
While the attorney general argues that vacating convictions may undermine public trust, many see it differently.
Nothing erodes confidence in the justice system more than fighting to keep an innocent person incarcerated.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0458-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-04-17 08:05:10.266526

(Courtesy of state of Indiana)An Indiana woman wants to sue the doctor who secretly used his own sperm to inseminate her mother, rather than the sperm provided by her father. But the question of when she was obligated to investigate her suspicions must first be decided by the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
Justices heard the case during a Wednesday hearing, and will rule soon on whether the woman can continue to pursue a lawsuit, despite the state’s two-year statute of limitations. 
 Former Indianapolis Dr. Donald Cline (Mugshot from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office)
The medical malpractice case centers on Dr. Donald Cline, the former Indianapolis fertility specialist who in 2017 admitted to using his own sperm to inseminate patients without their knowledge — or consent — during the 1970s and 1980s. DNA testing has since revealed that he deceptively fathered more than 90 children.
Attorneys and court documents all but name Cline in the latest legal proceedings. 
The plaintiff — referred to as “Anonymous Child 1” — definitively learned of her biological connection to Cline in 2022. She preferred to keep her identity hidden, however, “because her father, as we sit here today, does not know that he is not her father,” said Kent Winningham, the anonymous woman’s lawyer.
An “Anonymous Healthcare Group” is listed as second defendant alongside Cline.
Cline’s counsel argued Wednesday that the woman had a reasonable obligation to investigate in 2019, after widespread news reports revealed the doctor had used his own sperm to inseminate multiple patients. 
Winningham refuted, saying his client acted “promptly” after receiving DNA results from a 23andMe test kit three years later.
Arguments before the court
Cline treated the woman’s parents for fertility issues in 1985 “and was supposed to use sperm from Anonymous Child’s father to inseminate Anonymous Child’s mother,” according to court documents. 
The plaintiff’s counsel said it wasn’t until 2019 that she saw news reports indicating Cline had been accused of using his own sperm to inseminate some of his patients, rather than using third-party donor sperm.
At that time, however, Cline had not yet been accused of using his own sperm to inseminate patients where the patient’s spouse — not a third party — provided sperm for insemination.
Winningham said his client initially “thought it was unfathomable” that Cline could be her biological father because her parents didn’t use donor sperm. Although other patients had made allegations against the doctor, “those patients had undergone different procedures than her mother,” he said.
“She always thought she looked like her dad, and had always been told she looked like her paternal aunt, as well, based on the fact that her parents did not use a sperm donor. The doctor told them, ‘I’m using your dad, your husband’s sperm,’” Winningham told Indiana Court of Appeals judges on Wednesday. “She reasonably thought that, ‘OK, there is a group of people that have been affected — people who used sperm donors. Thank God my parents did not use a sperm donor.’ … Then when she found new information, she acted immediately.”
It was in 2022 that the woman viewed a trailer for the 2022 Netflix documentary “Our Father,” which highlighted the ethical and legal issues surrounding his actions.​










She reasonably thought that, ‘OK, there is a group of people that have been affected — people who used sperm donors. Thank God my parents did not use a sperm donor.’ … Then when she found new information, she acted immediately.


– Kent Winningham, the anonymous woman’s lawyer


“As soon as she realized, ‘Oh my gosh, he actually did this to people who believed their husband’s sperm was used, as well,’ she got a DNA test right away, and she filed her case within 20 days of getting those results,” Winningham continued. “Those are the acts of someone that is using, I think, reasonable diligence and promptness.”
But a trial court disagreed, ruling in July 2024 that the woman’s two-year clock for legal remedy began on Dec. 31, 2019, at which point she was “aware that she was conceived through infertility treatment, that Anonymous Physician was her parents’ infertility doctor, and that Anonymous Physician had allegedly used his own sperm to (impregnate) patients.”
Judge Elaine Brown additionally questioned why the woman “didn’t do anything” to investigate her DNA earlier.
“There’s no law that supports that someone has the responsibility to watch the news, and based on allegations in the news of a different subset of people, that means I’ve got to go file a case,” Winningham argued. “And that’s not good for our judicial system, either — for people to file cases blindly, based on allegations others make against a physician their parents may have treated with.”
Cline’s attorney pushes back
Meg ​​Christensen, one of Cline’s attorneys, held that the woman had “due diligence … to investigate her DNA in 2019,” because that’s when she learned “there was a possibility” that Cline could be her biological father. 
“At that point, it’s undisputed that she knew that (Cline) had used his own sperm to inseminate multiple patients, deceiving those patients,” Christensen said.
Brown wondered if “a possibility of some medical malpractice” alone should require “reasonable diligence” to investigate if malpractice had, in fact, occurred.
“Suspicion alone is not enough to file, but it is enough to trigger the obligation to investigate,” Christensen replied. “(In case law) you see the trigger date being tied to the date that the plaintiff had enough information to suspect that there might have been malpractice.”

Even so, Brown further questioned if the woman “had enough information that required her to diligently look into it” in 2019.
“If the law is that we have to know exactly what the plaintiff knew about what was being said to third parties, then the statute of limitations really doesn’t have much in the way of teeth,” Christensen said in response. 
“What we do know is that the plaintiff knew the physician treated her mother. The physician deceived multiple patients by using his own sperm and lying to them at the time and never disclosing it, and that he had continued to lie to members of the public and to other children conceived through this procedure,” the lawyer added. “With that knowledge, reasonable diligence requires her to do the thing that is only in her control to do. She is the only one who can do anything to further the investigation. Any reasonable person would proceed with some investigation.”
The judges additionally probed whether that burden should “be put on the plaintiff in a case such as this.”
Christensen pointed to the plaintiff’s earlier deposition, during which the woman discussed her early “denials” about Cline in a Facebook group for half-siblings fathered by the doctor.
“She says, ‘Well, how come we didn’t think it could apply to us? No one wants to think about something that horrific applying to you. That’s why I said it was outright denial. It couldn’t apply to us. It’s too unfathomable,’” Christensen quoted from the deposition. “She’s not saying, ‘I didn’t believe it applied to me.’ She’s saying, ‘I didn’t want it to, and I didn’t want to think about it because it was hard, and it is emotionally fraught.’ But that is not a reason to extend her timeline to investigate, unfortunately.”
Background on Cline
The woman’s legal team wants the Court of Appeals to return the matter to the lower court and allow the case to move forward. There’s no timeline for the appeals panel to issue a ruling.
Cline’s actions came to light in 2014, when another woman who was conceived via donor sperm discovered multiple half-siblings through at-home DNA testing. The discovery led to a broader investigation, and in 2017, Cline pleaded guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to investigators. He received a one-year suspended sentence. 
At the time, Indiana law did not specifically prohibit fertility doctors from using their own sperm without patient consent.​
The case prompted Indiana lawmakers to enact legislation in 2019 criminalizing fertility fraud, making it a Level 6 felony offense. The legislature also created a civil cause of action for fertility fraud, which enables the plaintiff to be awarded compensatory and punitive damages, or liquidated damages of $10,000.
The law is not retroactive, though — which is why Winningham said his client is seeking a malpractice case.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — For South Carolina inmates, Easter baskets take the form of clear bags stuffed with soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, notebooks, pens, envelopes and hard candy.
Twice a year, Baptist churches across the state donate enough supplies for each of the state’s prisoners to receive a baggie of toiletries and other small items. Earlier this month, about 50 volunteers, many of them prison chaplains, packed the donations into more than 16,300 bags that went to inmates in all 21 prisons.

The bags may not seem like much to many people, but inmates look forward to them every year, volunteers said.
The prison system provides basic necessities, but many inmates can’t afford anything beyond those, like good-smelling soap and candy, said Pamela Nates, a chaplain at Kirkland Correctional Institution’s maximum security unit.
“These things are like gold for them,” Nates said.
Many inmates try to make the items last as long as possible, Nates said.
The springtime packages came several months after every inmate received an identical package at Christmastime.
The bags aren’t just about extra supplies. The prisoners get a boost from knowing people outside the prison care enough to spend time and money assembling gift bags for them. Working inside the prisons, Nates has seen the way inmates’ faces light up when they receive the packages, she said.
“They feel so isolated and are in their own little world behind the bars,” Nates said. “To know that someone on the outside is caring enough to do this is a tremendous lift for them. It gives them hope.”
Many inmates may not have had access to similar supplies even outside of prison, making the gifts extra special, Nates said.
During her six years working with inmates, she has seen the way people can change while in prison if given the proper support, and resources like the gift bags are part of that, she said.
“I believe in my heart that part of the reason they’re there is because they weren’t cared for,” Nates said. “They weren’t given the basic needs, you know, toothpaste, soap, a toothbrush.”

Volunteers had already established a rhythm in packing their bags by about 9 a.m. on April 8.
Trucks packed with supplies pulled up to the front of the Bethlehem Baptist Church building. Police officers called for some of the 10 inmates brought from the minimum-security Manning Reentry and Work Release Center to unload them.
A couple inmates, dressed in tan jumpsuits, stacked bags and boxes of supplies along one wall of a yellow-painted gymnasium. Others brought those supplies to the folding tables set up throughout the room, where volunteers dumped out their contents, sorting them and packing them into plastic baggies.
Those baggies went into navy blue sacks that chaplains delivered to inmates the next day.
Unlike other programs, inmates can receive the gift bags regardless of their disciplinary record. However, the goal is still to encourage good behavior by reminding inmates that there is hope for them when they leave, said Corrections Director Bryan Stirling.
“It gives them incentive to still behave and a connection on the outside, to know that there are people out there that want to contribute and give them toiletries but are also praying for them,” Stirling said.

The supplies and volunteers came from the Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention’s approximately 1,100 member churches across the state. Their faith inspired them to do as much as possible to help others less fortunate, said Michael Cannon, a chaplain at eight Midlands prisons.
One verse from the book of Matthew in particular guided him: “When I was in prison, you visited me,” said Cannon, who is also a member of the Baptist convention at Piney Grove Missionary Baptist Church.
“We want to be in line with the Scripture, to be a blessing to the inmate population by giving them gifts and showing them love to support what the Scripture says,” Cannon said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3745-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 08:05:10.266526

From coast to coast, devastating fires and hurricanes have destroyed homes and livelihoods and changed the landscape of  our country. 
Closer to home, we’ve grown used to extreme weather and breathing the toxic air that wafts east from fires out West. 
Too many politicians have ignored these changes in the face of fossil fuel companies flooding the political and media ecosystem with cash and disinformation, and it’s at times driven us to hopelessness.
As high school seniors, we’re rejecting hopelessness and channeling these frustrations into action.  
Our climate club started seven years ago, when we were in sixth grade. Although we were young, we were aware of the environmental damage occurring all around us. But seeing reduced snowfall in the winters and experiencing the warming of Lake Superior spurred us to do something. We eventually decided that getting solar panels for our school would be a good first step. 
Our original plan was to encourage our district leaders to install a 40 kilowatt solar array on our middle school, enough to offset the electricity used by the gym lights. We researched, collaborated with energy experts from the city, and presented our findings to the Duluth School Board. 
Despite the energy savings and carbon reduction the panels would bring, it was too expensive. 
We didn’t let that stop us though. We sought solutions. We went to the Legislature, and lobbied and testified for the passage of the Solar for Schools Grant, a program providing funding to schools across Minnesota for solar panels. To this day, over 150 schools in the state have used this resource.
When the pandemic arrived, we were frequently out of school and our club’s numbers suffered as a result. 
Last year, however, we restarted the club with renewed passion. We quickly gained nearly 30 members and continued to pursue our original goal of solar for our district. Again, we researched, worked with professionals, and worked up a plan.
Last June, we spoke at a school board listening session and explained the risks of the climate crisis to all of us, as well as the opportunity in solar and for Duluth to become a leader in renewable energy.
We discussed how the Solar for Schools Grant and Inflation Reduction Act (now at risk from the Trump administration) would drastically reduce the price of a solar array, large or small. 
We got the school district on board with a project, and they have since submitted an application for the Solar for Schools Grant. They are planning on pursuing an array of about 100 kilowatts on the administration building, which is smaller than we hoped for, but is still a step in the right direction. Hopefully, our school district will recognize the environmental and economic benefit of solar, and install more in the future. 
As young people, we are constantly reminded that we will be the generation to fix climate change. (The headlines and horror stories and our own personal experiences are reminders enough; you all can stop telling us now!) We also want to stress that combating climate change will require hard work from all of us, not just young people. 
From our seven years of work on this project, we have learned that everyone and anyone can pitch in, but putting ideas into practice takes work. 
We all need to start doing more and pushing others to do more. 
One easy thing everyone can do is banish hopelessness and demoralization. These mentalities, although they are often our initial reaction to bad news, only give us an excuse for inaction.
We hope our story about a little climate club illustrates that we all have the power to make our own decisions, and stem the tide of the climate crisis. 
The young people are asking you to try. Let’s do it together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/StudentSolar-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 07:07:06.936847

(Photo by Reinaldo Diaz of Lake Worth Waterkeeper)There used to be a TV game show called “To Tell the Truth.” It ran from 1956 to 1968, then was revived in syndication in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Then, because network TV executives seldom have new ideas, ABC brought it back in 2016 for a six-year revival. We’ll probably see it again in the next decade.
The game worked like this: Three contestants would all claim to be the same person. Two were impostors willing to lie up a storm, while the real one was required to tell the truth. The celebrity panel had to guess which was which.
I thought of that old game show the other day while watching the Florida Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources run a confirmation hearing. In the hot seat: the sitting chairman of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Rodney Barreto.
Over the past 20 years, Barreto has been appointed to the commission by three different governors — Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist, and Ron DeSantis — which suggests governors are as unoriginal as network execs. This was Barreto’s fourth confirmation hearing, and by far the roughest, because mobs of people contacted the senators to urge them to reject him.
After Barreto swore to tell the truth, senators asked him about the objections people had raised. Some were angry that he voted to allow a toll road to be built through a Central Florida preserve. Some were upset about the wildlife commission’s push for another bear hunt. Others were mad about his advocacy of the purposely misleading Amendment 2.
But there was one exchange that I found particularly fascinating.
Barreto makes his living as a developer and lobbyist. Sen. Gayle Harrell asked him if he was trying to build condominiums on submerged land on Singer Island in Palm Beach County.
Barreto acknowledged that he owns property there but swore he wasn’t trying to build anything.
“I don’t know who’s telling you that I’m building condos there,” he testified. “There’s not one application in front of any governing body.”
When Harrell asked him if he’d ever tried to build on his submerged land, he told her, “Never.” Then he stood there defiantly, as if about to break into the Eurythmics song “Would I Lie To You?”
The committee moved on. I regret to report that nobody brought up the fact that, in 2021, the Palm Beach Post ran a story about Barreto headlined, “Top Florida wildlife official wants to fill, build on lagoon where turtles, manatees roam.”
“Florida’s top appointed protector of wildlife wants to make millions by dredging up and filling in acres of the wildlife-filled Lake Worth Lagoon,” the story begins. “Rodney Barreto … is pressing legal action to let his company fill, dredge and build hundreds of condos and houses on mostly submerged land off Singer Island.”
Maybe he didn’t intend to say something so blatantly untrue while he was under oath. Maybe he’s just so busy developing land that he forgot about this one controversial project.
Others offered a different theory.
  Lesley Blackner via screen grab
“He’s just used to getting his way,” said Lesley Blackner, a Stuart attorney and longtime foe of Florida sprawl who testified against Barreto. “And not being questioned.”
 The mission of the commission
Barreto isn’t some clueless outsider who’s swooped in to destroy Florida’s environment. He’s from here.
“When I grew up in Miami,” he told the Senate committee, “I hunted in the Everglades and went fishing in Biscayne Bay. … It was the best time of my life.”
Now he’s a millionaire who owns property in four states, chaired the Miami Super Bowl Host Committee three times, and routinely hobnobs with well-known politicians, raising beaucoup bucks for them and their causes.
“I’m in the business of making money,” he told the senators.
This is not how the wildlife commission started in 1998. Back then, the commissioners included a wildlife biologist, a dentist, a cattle rancher, an insurance executive, a charter boat captain, a retired sheriff, and a defense attorney.
The difference, I think, is that the governor who appointed that first board, Lawton Chiles, limited his campaign contributions to $100 maximum. Now the appointees are all big-money boys reaping the benefits of being major contributors to the governor.
“It’s all quid pro quo now,” Blackner said.
The problem with filling the board with campaign contributors in the real estate and development business, though, is that they’re likely to have projects that conflict with the mission of the commission.
Take the project Sen. Harrell asked Barreto about. He bought his property in 2016 for $425,000. Two years later, under the name of a company run by Barreto and his wife called Government Lot 1 LLC, he filed an application to build 330 condos, 15 single family homes, 30 boat slips, and a 50-slip marina with a restaurant and community center.
To build this would require dumping fill in 12 acres of submerged land and dredging 4 acres of the submerged property. This is a style of destructive development we seldom see in Florida anymore.

  Reinaldo Diaz with a horseshoe crab, via Lake Worth Waterkeeper
The place where it would be built, by the way, is adjacent to John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, which Reinaldo Diaz, of Lake Worth Waterkeeper, calls “one of the best state parks in the state.”
As for the property Barreto wanted to develop, it has “the highest density of juvenile sea turtles in at least the east coast of Florida,” Diaz told me. “Nearby is the only significant horseshoe crab nesting site I’ve found in the Lake Worth Lagoon”
That spot is so full of wildlife, he said, because Barreto’s property consists of “nothing but seagrass and a strip of mangroves.”
 Water into land
Until about 50 years ago, Florida developers believed the best way to build a new waterfront subdivision was to do what Barreto was proposing: Create new land out of water.
They would dump fill on the submerged property, turning water into dry land, meanwhile burying mangroves and seagrass aucods galore.
  Leroy Collins via Florida State Archives
In St. Petersburg, for instance, so many developers had built dredge-and-fill subdivisions on Boca Ciega Bay by 1957 that Gov. LeRoy Collins quipped, “Pretty soon, we’re going to have to drill to find water here.”
When Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, the new Environmental Protection Agency used it to stop a harmful dredge-and-fill project in Florida.
Harbor Isles was to be built on the edge of Tampa Bay by using 1.3 million cubic yards of fill dirt to create 281 acres of dry land. It would destroy what biologists called “a rich estuarine area.”
The EPA won that case. Then it won seven more in the Florida Keys, laying the groundwork for ending such destructive development, not just in Florida but nationwide.
Because Barreto’s development project was a throwback to the bad old days, it did not get a warm reception from the state.
One of the agencies to which he applied for a permit, the South Florida Water Management District, sent back a 17-page letter that basically said, “Dude, you have GOT to be kidding.”
Noting the serious impact on “an unknown amount of open water, submerged bottom, mangrove and seagrass habitats,” the staff wrote that they had “considerable concerns” and would likely say no.
Barreto withdrew the application — but he was far from done with the project.
For the next step, he basically tried to resurrect the dead.
 The last thing
Despite the Clean Water Act, some would-be developers had already secured permits for using the old-fashioned building method. Government officials had to negotiate a way to stop them. The settlements they worked out made sure that kind of rampant destruction faded.
In 2020, Barreto filed a legal motion to reopen one of those old cases. He asked the court to revive this long-settled matter so his Singer Island project could be declared exempt from modern environmental regulations and he could proceed to build.
He joined with two other owners of submerged property to legally object to the Riviera Beach commissioners rezoning their land for preservation. That would prevent their development plans, they argued.
These efforts backfired when the Palm Beach Post reported that the lead defender of Florida’s wildlife was also the guy trying to destroy a bunch of it. A public uproar ensued. People demanded he either drop his development plans or resign.

“It’s not just any part of the lagoon, it is absolutely the best part, in terms of its environment,” Lisa Interlandi of the Everglades Law Center said during an FWC board meeting at the time.
To quiet everyone down, Barreto dismissed his legal challenges and told the Miami Herald he would immediately sell the property.
However, it appears that his promise to sell the land was another — oh, what’s that word that’s the opposite of “true?” It’s right on the tip of my tongue.
Rather than sell the land, Barreto’s corporation hung onto it. He still owns it. He testified to the Senate committee that his only plan was to use it as “mitigation” to make up for someone else’s mangrove-destroying development plans.
But a more recent Barreto lawsuit tells a different story.
Last year, Barreto’s corporation sued Riviera Beach over the property. Barreto contended that by rezoning the land so it could not be developed, the commissioners had in effect taken it from him and he demanded to be paid. That lawsuit is still pending.
I contacted Interlandi about all this. She told me: “The last thing Florida’s submerged lands need is people trying to get rich off them.  I think this is a great opportunity to pivot and focus on land conservation, not land development.”
I tried to contact Barreto to ask him about that.
I should warn you that this is where the story gets weird.
 Sign on the line
I have interviewed Barreto several times in the past. For some reason, he didn’t return my calls this week. Probably too busy raising money for DeSantis’ new foundation, “Hope Florida Doesn’t Find Out.”
Instead, to my surprise, I heard from someone who claimed to be Barreto’s partner in owning the submerged land. And it wasn’t his wife.
His name is Glenn Larson. He’s president of a Miami company called Dock & Marine Construction that’s been around since 1959.
Larson told me he’d known Barreto ever since the future mover-and-shaker was a police officer. He said he also built the Barretos’ backyard docks.
This is the one and only time they’ve been partners in anything, Larson told me. He just happened to bump into Barreto while he was considering buying the submerged land and Barreto agreed to join forces with him, Larson said.
Barreto didn’t mention him to the Senate committee and Larson’s name doesn’t appear anywhere in the property records. I asked him if he had any paperwork to show he’s a partner.
“I’m the half-owner, but when they recorded the deed, they left my name off of it,” he told me. In other words, no.
The attorney who filed the deed was going to correct that oversight, he said. But that’s when Larson — not Barreto! — filed the application to build all those houses and condos on the property, he said.
“I kind of messed him up,” Larson told me.
When the water district sent back that letter with all the conditions, he told me, “Rodney called me and said, ‘What the hell are you doing, man?’ So, I withdrew it.”
Larson insisted that Barreto had no knowledge of the development plans, and that’s why his answers to Sen. Harrell were not perjury.

Hang on a second, I said. The signature on the permit application looks like Barreto’s, not yours. You’re just listed as a contractor.
He acknowledged that Barreto did sign the permit application.
“I probably went and left the paperwork at his house to get his signature,” Larson said. “But he didn’t know what I was doing.”
I find it hard to believe Barreto, a hard-headed businessman if ever there was one, would sign any document without reading it.
Anyway, despite all the people who urged them to kick Barreto to the curb, the Senate committee voted 8-1 to confirm him for another term as a wildlife commissioner. Even Sen. Harrell voted for him.
Barreto has yet to appear before his second and final Senate hearing, this time with the Ethics and Elections Committee. The hearing hasn’t been scheduled yet, so he’s got some time to consider what answers he’ll give. I promise we can handle the truth.

Doug Beck, D-Affton, speaks to reporters in April 2022 (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri Democrats stonewalled a Republican effort to roll back a voter-approved paid sick leave law, blocking action in the Senate for more than nine hours before GOP leadership adjourned the chamber around 1 a.m. Thursday.
A bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, would gut Proposition A, a voter-approved law requiring most employers to provide paid sick time off for hundreds of thousands of qualifying workers starting May 1. 
Bernskoetter said Proposition A “creates a one-size-fits-all” solution that would hurt businesses.
“An agreement to exchange time and talent for wages and other benefits is a contract between employee and employer, so I don’t really think we should be getting in the middle of that,” Bernskoetter said, adding that voters may not have understood the extent of the law from the ballot summary.
The bill passed out of the House last month on a vote of 96 to 51. If the Senate approves the bill, it will head to the governor’s desk. 
The bill would also modify the minimum wage law by removing the requirement that it be indexed to inflation.
Democrats began filibustering the bill shortly after Berskoetter brought it to the floor Wednesday, just before 4 p.m.
Senate Democratic Leader Doug Beck of Affton has called the issue of overturning Prop A a “red line.”
“When I say I stand up for working families and workers, I take that seriously,” Beck said. 
Beck said he and Republican leadership worked on a compromise dealing with “some details of implementation” that was then upended.
“I’m going to continue those negotiations, and we’ll see what we can do, if we can come to some sort of conclusion. Maybe. Again, we might not,” Beck said when the filibuster began.
Bernskoetter told him: “There’s just a lot of businesses that are affected by this all over our state, and it’s just a cumbersome process. I’m sure we can come to some kind of a solution.”

Proposition A passed with over 57% of the vote in Missouri, including rural, suburban and urban counties. 
As he began the Democratic filibuster Wednesday evening, Beck ticked through each Senate district’s vote totals, noting that it passed in 20 of the chamber’s 34 districts, including 11 represented by Republicans. 
“This is literally a mandate,” Beck said, from the voters. “…The voters were never deceived.”
State Sen. Angela Mosley, a St. Louis Democrat, said the bill “will send a message back to their constituents that their public input doesn’t matter.” 
The legislature should wait to see what the impact is before intervening, said Democratic state Sen. Steve Roberts of St. Louis.
“What was passed was reasonable, it’s fair and it’s what our constituents want,” he said.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, said the legislature continues helping the wealthiest, including through the proposed capital gains tax cut the Senate passed last week.
“We’re doing a lot of things to help Missourians that are at the 1% of the 1%, or the people that are very, very fortunate. But then we’re just piling things on and just doing everything we can, it feels like we’re just kicking and going after regular working families…And you know, we’re doing things that just continue to just make it harder for people to make ends meet each and every month.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, said the passage of Prop A is evidence of the problems with Missouri’s initiative petition process, which he said puts major policy decisions in the hands of voters rather than the government they elected to represent them. It should’ve never gone to the people for a vote, he said.
“This is one of those things, of the problem with direct democracy,” Brattin said. “This is exactly what our founders were expressively against when they formed this nation.”
He said small businesses won’t be able to absorb the costs. 
“The people casting the ballots for measures such as this, they have no skin in the game whatsoever, when it comes to these sorts of measures,” Brattin said. “No realization of the detriment, or the harm that it may cause to their very own bottom dollar, because they may not even understand what these measures would do to their employer.”
On Wednesday night, as GOP leadership adjourned the chamber because an agreement could not be reached, Senate Majority Leader Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, posted on social media that the debate is not over.
“We will set this aside for the moment but we are committed to getting it done before session ends,” she wrote. “This is a basic economic issue that we cannot let become permanently ensconced in our state. We will return to this in the next couple weeks. Stay tuned.”

Under the law, beginning May 1 employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours. The law also gradually increases the minimum wage.
The bill would allow the minimum wage to increase to $15 per hour in 2026, as voters approved, but it would not be adjusted for inflation thereafter — a policy that has been in place since 2007. The sick leave provisions would be repealed entirely.
Those provisions would make sick leave guaranteed for around 728,000 workers who currently lack it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.
Business groups at last month’s hearing called the measure a “job killer.”
Buddy Lahl, from the Missouri Restaurant Association, called the requirements on businesses “extremely cumbersome” and said the law is a “slippery slope” for what businesses will be required to provide.
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for Proposition A, said it was modeled on paid sick leave policies in 18 other states.
“It will make Missouri workers more likely to have to go to work while sick, jeopardizing their own health, the health of their coworkers and of Missouri workplaces,” he said last month, of the legislation to overturn Prop A.
Many of the same industry groups who testified at hearings to challenge the law are also challenging Proposition A in the state Supreme Court. The court has not handed down a decision yet.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Only a handful of us who served in the legislature under the old 1889 Montana Constitution still survive. That constitution reflected the dominant power of the copper mining industry when Montana achieved statehood. It was also ridiculously verbose and prescriptive, and by the late 1960s a consensus had developed that the time had come for our 1889 Constitution to be replaced. Among the people’s major concerns was the secrecy by which laws were made within the Legislature.

It was 1971 when, at 23, I took my seat in the Montana House of Representatives – the youngest member. The House chamber was overwhelming in its grandeur.  What I didn’t know then was that what went on in that grand place was far less grand than its setting.

Legislative bodies are organized around committees.  One of my earliest experiences in a Montana Legislative committee was having the committee chair excuse all nonmembers from the committee room except two gentlemen whom I soon learned were lobbyists.  They were hired by a special interest to protect that interest’s affairs in the legislative process.  Behind those doors, closed to citizens, these selected lobbyists freely interacted with committee members as they voted on the bills before the committee.  With no experience, I simply assumed this was fine.  Certainly, as the legislature’s greenest newbie, I wasn’t going to question it.

Fortunately, a few legislators were starting openly do so.  One, was Flathead Representative James E. Murphy.  Murphy had served in the Missouri legislature before relocating to Montana after World War II.  He led the Montana House Judiciary Committee and was also Montana’s representative on the Republican National Committee.  I greatly admired Jim Murphy.

Murphy thought the 1889 Constitution was far outdated and needed to be replaced.  A prime example of what needed changing was my first experiences with the public’s lack of access to legislative decision-making and the open role of lobbyists in orchestrating law-making decisions behind closed doors.

Well, the committee procedure I witnessed in the 1971 legislative session could not happen in the Montana legislature of today, thanks to Montana’s 1972 Constitution. It requires legislative meetings as well as other government meetings to be open to the public.  No longer can lobbyists, but not the public, be allowed to meet with and impact decisions of committees behind closed doors.

Under the 1889 Constitution, legislation was routinely passed or killed by either the Montana House or Senate, with few recorded votes and no way for the folks at home to really know how their legislators had voted.  Since 1972 they always can.  It is constitutionally required.

Once in 1971, we house members were startled by a camera flash from the back balcony of the chamber.  A photographer had taken a picture of the voting board of a vote that the 1889 Constitution allowed to be non-recorded, “off the record,” even though that vote essentially determined the outcome of an important bill.  The Speaker immediately called for the Sergeant-at-Arms to apprehend the photographer’s film.  But the photographer was too fast and escaped, film intact, from the capitol building.  When the state papers carried the picture of the voting board the following day, the votes of all legislators on that bill were revealed.

Such a dramatic act to inform the people is not needed now, thanks to the 1972 Constitution, which stipulates that any vote in the House or Senate, including committees, that could result in a bill being passed or killed must be publicly recorded.

These true-life examples directly show how much more open to the people the Montana legislature is since the adoption of our 1972 Constitution.

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.













Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


–  Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug





“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, introduced a bill to prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing publicly-funded assistance — requiring state agencies to verify immigration status for services like vaccines, prenatal and postnatal care, and food aid for children.
His bill was met with bipartisan concerns that it would hurt pregnant women, mothers and their children who don’t have proper immigration paperwork alike. That group of legislators voted to hold the bill in the committee, effectively killing the bill for the remainder of the 2024 legislative session.

However, Redman brought the bill back in 2025 — this time as House Bill 135. It passed both legislative chambers by a wide margin, and Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed it into law on April 3. It is set to take effect July 1. 
Driven by the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, Idaho lawmakers have reintroduced and advanced a wave of immigration-related bills this year. Among them is House Bill 135 — one of two bills revived in 2025 that gained enough support to pass, contributing to at least seven immigration-focused bills introduced this year.
Dr. Noreen Womack, a pediatrician at St. Luke’s, said she believes House Bill 135 will significantly impact health care for children who come to the U.S. without proper immigration paperwork. Immunization rates are already low in Idaho, and she said this bill would exacerbate that. 
“Children are completely blameless in this,” she said, noting that she serves many youth who do not have legal permission to be in the U.S. “It was not their decision to come here.”
Womack’s concerns reflect similar concerns around Idaho’s 2025 wave of immigration-related bills. In addition to House Bill 135, here is a rundown of the bills focused on regulating immigration in the Gem State, and where each bill stands after the Idaho Legislature’s 2025 session.

 Idaho governor says causing fear would be ‘counterintuitive’ to purpose of House Bill 83

House Bill 83, another revived bill, was signed into law this year.
It creates new crimes called “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry.” Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a separate crime. It also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien.” The bill was signed into law by the governor on March 27, but a lawsuit from the ACLU of Idaho has temporarily blocked it from taking effect. 
In a press conference with reporters and legislative leadership on March 31, Little said the focus of the bill is to help the Trump administration deliver its immigration goals, while also focusing on targeting criminals. 
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said the legislation is “a step in the right direction.”
ACLU of Idaho sues state for new immigration enforcement bill just signed into law

“We’re talking about individuals that are here illegally, not supposed to be here in the first place, and then they break the law,” Moyle said at the conference. “This now gives us an opportunity to work more with the feds, and it gives us an opportunity to take the worst of the worst that are in this country illegally and send them back to where they came from and keep our community safe.”
But opponents of the bill say the law would cause fear and discourage unauthorized immigrants in Idaho from reporting crimes they’ve witnessed or are experiencing.
“That would be counterintuitive to the intent if we made people fearful,” Little said in response to those concerns. “Our goal is to keep everybody here safe, and that’s what this piece of legislation is.”
Idaho State Police Lt. Colonel Fritz Zweigart reinforced the idea that the bill is focused on targeting criminals. 
“We are going to focus on the crime that’s reported, not necessarily that’s reporting the crime, unless they’re of course involved in the criminal activity,” Zweigart said at the press conference.   
Still, domestic violence advocates in Idaho say these laws will prevent immigrant victims from seeking help.
“What you’re going to see is reporting is going to go down because they don’t want to be in trouble for reporting a crime if they do not have papers,” Teena McBride, the executive director of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Center in Idaho Falls, told the Sun. “And what you start to see is that the intensity of the violence is going to increase.”
Angelica Soto, director of client care at Voices Against Violence in Twin Falls, said she has noticed growing fear among immigrant clients seeking appointments, support groups, or services like food boxes and personal care items.

 Bills introduced, but not passed in Idaho Legislature 

The following is a list of bills introduced during the session that either failed to receive a hearing or were held in committee and did not advance.
Harboring unauthorized immigrants
House Bill 335 would have made it a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on how many people are involved, to help, hide or transport unauthorized immigrants. 
Sponsor: Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood
Status: Held in committee on March 5 
Collecting students’ immigration status
House Bill 382 would have added immigration status and nationality to the demographic data collected by Idaho public schools, ranging from K-12 schools, higher education institutions and public career technical schools. It would have required the data to be available on the state department of education’s website. 
Sponsors: Rep. Steve Tanner, R-Nampa; Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood
Status: It did not receive a committee hearing. Sponsors pulled the bill from the agenda the day it was set to receive a hearing because it lacked support, KTVB reported.
E-Verify requirements
House Bill 252 would have required all Idaho employers to use E-Verify, a program meant to check a person’s legal work status. 
Sponsor: Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene
Status: Introduced, did not receive a hearing 
State guest worker program
House Bill 297 would have created a year-round guest worker program managed by the state. 
Sponsors: Rep. Britt Raybould, R-Rexburg; Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa
Status: Introduced, did not receive a hearing
No voting for non-citizens
House Bill 94 would have required that only citizens vote in federal, state, local and public elections in Idaho. (Non-U.S. citizens are already not allowed to vote in nearly all U.S. elections, but some places outside of Idaho allow non-U.S. citizens to vote in local elections.)
Sponsors: Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa
Status: Introduced, did not receive a hearing

Sarah Huckabee Sanders touts legislative wins during an April 16, 2025 press conference. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Republicans celebrated the end of the legislative session Wednesday, touting policy victories on issues such as education, maternal health, youth technology use and cutting taxes.
At an afternoon press conference, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the leaders of each chamber for managing “personalities” within their conferences. The first-term Republican governor also individually named legislators who sponsored key legislative measures, such as eradicating “woke” ideology from universities in the state, adding more requirements to “end petition fraud” for constitutional amendments, and passing what she described as “the most significant economic development legislation in decades.”
“This session has reinforced that Arkansas’ conservative majority is delivering on our promises to the people of this state…for too long, our government has been enslaved to powerful special interests — not anymore,” Sanders said. “We do not work for them. We work for the people of Arkansas.”
Democratic lawmakers, at their own press conference, took the Republican supermajority to task for “out-of-control spending on misguided policies,” power grabs and the seepage of divisive national politics into Arkansas policymaking. Six members of the Senate and 19 members of the House are Democrats.
Speaker of the House Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, called the session a “resounding success,” while Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said the results from this year’s session showed that the state is “not always at the back of the pack.”
Sanders touted bills that aligned with many of the goals she outlined in her January State of the State address, such as cracking down on what Chinese nationals and businesses are able to do in the state.
“We will put enhanced penalties on violent criminal illegals and make sure our state is not a safe harbor for violent illegals,” Sanders said. “We will continue our record as the toughest state in America on our communist Chinese adversaries, banning them from owning land, partnering with our cities or selling merchandise to state government.”

Talking about some of that legislation, House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, said national politics crept in and poisoned “what used to be a proud Arkansas tradition of independence.” 
“Cookie-cutter bills from national right-wing think tanks chipped away at the popular punching bags of today — DEI, immigrants, China and LGBT people. …In most cases these bills are mostly for show, red meat for a national audience, but they will have harmful consequences for real people in Arkansas,” Collins said.
Sanders listed a variety of other Republican victories, such as amendments to Arkansas’ Social Media Safety Act, and bills targeting Big Tech and pharmacy benefit managers, but there were some defeats. For example, a bill that would have criminalized lobbying for certain foreign entities like China, part of a broader package of China-related legislation, failed multiple times in the Senate this week and ultimately failed to make to the governor’s desk.
“Today isn’t just about one bill, it’s about the people that we serve and standing up to the powerful special interests who try to stop us,” Sanders said. “We went after Big Tech companies exploiting our kids, big drug middlemen manipulating drug prices, big government subsidizing junk food at the taxpayer’s expense, lobbyists working for adversaries like China, woke faculty trying to indoctrinate our students, and the far-left that wants to coddle dangerous criminal illegals that threaten our elections with petition fraud.”


Let us know what you think...


 

During her State of the State address, Sanders made known her desire to reform higher education this session the same way she’d done with K-12 education with the LEARNS Act in 2023.
The Arkansas ACCESS Act made significant changes to higher education, including prohibitions on excused absences for political protests and the collection and reporting of DEI-related information for institutional accreditation purposes. The legislation also permits faculty performance reviews to result in the removal of tenure status and will allow for the incorporation of a return-on-investment metric in the higher education funding model, among other things. 
Republicans also pushed through a bill that banned students from using cellphones in schools — another Sanders priority — and amended the Educational Freedom Account Program to limit how much money participants could spend on things like extracurricular activities and travel expenses.
Sanders and Republicans lawmakers made the ballot petition process a priority during the session, passing multiple bills that opponents say are a direct assault on the people’s right to direct democracy.
Collins called the bills affecting the petition process “the most egregious power grab of the session” and a “full-on assault on direct democracy.” 
“Republicans have made it nearly impossible to exercise your right to petition to get something on the ballot,” he said. “We will soon regret snatching away the people’s right to petition.”

The Little Rock Democrat said power grabs were one of the most consistent themes of the session, “usually coming at the expense of the people of Arkansas.”
“ACCESS eliminated, shrank and kicked community stakeholders off boards, centralizing power in the governor,” Collins said.
“One legislator tried to force Arkansas PBS and the State Library to comply with his demands. When the State Library Board didn’t agree, the Legislature fired the entire board,” he said. “Countless bills were introduced to micromanage cities, counties, state agencies and school boards, as the emboldened Republican supermajority apparently decided it wasn’t enough to do their jobs, they needed to do everybody else’s job too.”
Free school breakfast, maternal health Medicaid, school cellphone ban all become Arkansas law

Republicans and Democrats also achieved wins working across the aisle, passing legislation to  to improve maternal health and make breakfast free for all students.
“In a bipartisan compromise effort, we, alongside Sen. [Jonathan] Dismang and Sen. Clarke Tucker, made Arkansas the first state in the South to offer free school breakfast to every single one of our students,” Sanders said.
At their press conference, Democratic leaders also highlighted the bipartisan effort on free school breakfasts now Act 123.
Evans said that Arkansans should be proud of the legislators they sent to Little Rock, praising members of his conference for “putting politics aside” and contributing to a successful session.
 Democrats remain defiant

Senate Minority Leader Greg Leding of Fayetteville said that despite the long odds against Democrats in both legislative chambers, they were still able to “score some meaningful wins,” both in terms of legislation they were able to stop and legislation they passed. 
He singled out freshman Sen. Jamie Scott of North Little Rock, whom he called “one of the most thoughtful, compassionate leaders” in the Legislature, and first-term Rep. Jessie McGruder of Marion for their work on maternal health issues and early voting.
Leding highlighted the united work of all legislative Democrats in helping Republican opponents derail a $750 million appropriation bill intended for a new 3,000-bed prison in rural western Arkansas.
“Regardless of what you think of the need for a prison, it’s clear that that plan for Franklin County is wrong,” Leding said.
Collins cited the prison as part of the budget-busting theme of the session.
“The message was clear from the very beginning of session, Republicans were going to bust the budget on no-limit private school vouchers and a misguided billion dollar-plus prison in Franklin County, and there wouldn’t be much left for anything else. And that’s exactly what happened,” he said. “While Democrats and others rejected prison spending for now, that bill is coming due.”
Going forward, Collins said Democrats will continue to push for the issues they made a priority at the beginning of the session in January: education; health care, especially maternal and mental health; and democracy.
 Vetos

After both press conferences were finished, Sanders’ office announced she had vetoed two items: a bill that legalized the delivery of marijuana or the purchase of it from a drive-thru, along with a line-item veto eliminating the salary for the director of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s Institute on Race and Ethnicity.
“This session I championed Arkansas ACCESS, my plan to make college more accessible for all and get indoctrination out of college classrooms,” Sanders wrote in her veto letter to Hester and Evans. “Arkansas will not waste nearly $200,000 in taxpayer dollars on DEI administrators who promote woke nonsense.”
However, it is not clear if the institute is still functioning. A search of UALR’s website turned up results for strategic plans that referenced the institute last year, before ACCESS was passed, but when clicked on the webpages appeared to have been taken down or moved. A search of UALR’s directory did not appear to return results for anyone directly employed by the institute.
When asked for comment, a UALR spokesperson said the position was vacant and the university had not planned to fill it.
Sanders said she vetoed House Bill 1889 because it would have “expand[ed] access to usable marijuana.”

All now move to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.,"Rep. Garrett Bascom (center) chats with colleagues in the House chamber on April 9, 2025. His immigration enforcement effort is the only surviving bill on that topic. (Courtesy Indiana House Republicans)Indiana lawmakers are giving law enforcement explicit instructions on how to “cooperate” with federal immigration enforcement efforts under legislation that passed the House 58-19 Wednesday. It is one of dozens of bills that got final concurrence votes in the House and Senate, including curtailing the state’s controversial economic development agency, chiding health insurers and more.
All now move to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
Rep. Garrett Bascom, R-Lawrenceburg, said Indiana law on local collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) takes a passive approach.
His House Bill 1393 would require jails and detention facilities to tell county sheriffs when they have probable cause to believe that someone they’re booking on unrelated misdemeanor or felony charges isn’t legally in the country. Sheriffs would have to report that information to ICE.
“This is being done in most of our counties,” Bascom said. “This defines the action we want to see.”
The Senate softened the language — including by taking the onus off officers on the street and placing it more firmly on sheriffs — but opponents still believe it will lead to racial profiling.
Rep. Mike Andrade, D-Munster, noted that counties already have policies on this, whether it be a fax to ICE or a direct call.
“They’re already doing the work,” he said. “This is a do-nothing bill.”
Senate Republicans blocked another immigration bill that also could have cracked down on employers for using illegal workers.
Economic development scrutiny measure finalized
Legislation taking aim at the Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC) easily earned a ticket to Braun’s desk on a unanimous, 41-0 concurrence vote in the Indiana Senate. Lawmakers there concurred with several changes made in the House.
Senate Bill 516 establishes an office for entrepreneurship and innovation, a Braun agenda item. The new office would assume oversight of certified technology parks, currently an IEDC duty.
  Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon, chats with a colleague in the Senate chamber on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
IEDC has faced years worth of backlash from lawmakers and constituents alike over its secretive approach to economic development efforts like the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace (LEAP) Innovation District.
“Over the last few years, obviously there’s been a lot of questions, a lot of concerns over IEDC,” author Sen. Brian Buchanan told the Capital Chronicle. “We’re just trying to find a way to make sure the transparency and accountability is there that people expect, but still also they have the ability to do their job and do it very successfully.”
The bill tasks the IEDC and the executives of communities that host innovation development districts — like one within LEAP — with annually compiling reports about the districts’ activities over the last calendar year. A detailed list of information must be included.
Buchanan, R-Lebanon, said some residents either “absolutely do not like” LEAP or “tremendously embrace it.” But most, he added, “just have questions. They want to know what’s going on. How’s it going to impact them? What’s it going to mean? And that’s where I think the additional transparency and accountability will help.”
The legislation would also require the quasi-public agency to tell local units of government about acquisitions of more than 100 acres — whether it’s bought in one or multiple transactions — at least 30 days before those purchases close.
LEAP spending nears $1B with projected budget shielded, investigation finds

The State Budget Committee must get a copy of that notice. And IEDC would have to extend any invitations to tour potential sites to the entire committee, not just GOP leadership.
Additionally, Senate Bill 516 would split the IEDC president role off from the cabinet-level commerce secretary role. Under current law, they’re held by the same person.
Braun’s already been willing to curtail the agency.
Last week, he ordered Indiana Economic Development Foundation and other state-affiliated nonprofits to file disclosures with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the State Budget Committee, retroactive to 10 years and moving forward.
 Put up your dukes!
The House easily gave final approval to a bill requiring the Indiana Gaming Commission to regulate bare-knuckle fighting and more. House Bill 1073 also includes mixed martial arts, martial arts, professional wrestling, boxing and sparring.
Rep. Craig Haggard, R-Mooresville, said unsanctioned events have been occurring around Indiana, and that it’s a safety concern.
It passed the House 83-2. The two members who voted against the legislation were Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and Rep. Heath VanNatter, R-Kokomo.
Health coverage, other measures also cross finish line
Also in the Senate, weakened limits on prior authorization are just steps away from law after an attempt last year died. Senate Bill 480 received a 39-2 concurrence vote.
“I know that we’ve got a ways to go … but I think that this is a very important start,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis.
She thanked author Sen. Tyler Johnson, R-Leo, for his work on the health insurer cost-control technique.
  Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks in committee on April 10, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“This is going to be an important step in lowering health care costs for Hoosiers and making sure that we just protect our health care benefits,” Hunley added.
And renters might soon find it easier to get certain evictions sealed from their records after beneficial legislation advanced on a 35-1 tally.
Author Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said that Hoosier tenants can’t always get evictions expunged, even when they’ve paid what they owe or otherwise resolved the dispute. She said Senate Bill 142 allows that renter to “have that black mark, if you will, on their record removed.”
Brown acknowledged that it doesn’t “fulfill all the needs” that tenant advocates sought, and that she’d continue to work on the topic in the future, “but I think we’re in a really good spot right now.”
Also exiting the legislative process after favorable concurrence votes were Senate measures setting out “standard operating procedures” for eyewitness identification and modestly extending the statute of limitations for Level 3 felony rape prosecution.
Under Indiana law, the legislative session must end by the end of the month.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ever since I was a child, Oklahoma schools have struggled in terms of teaching history and civics.
Even when I was too young to understand what Joseph McCarthy’s “Red Scare” was, I could sense that educators remained intimidated by what I learned was rightwing propaganda. And when I became a teacher at John Marshall High School in the early 1990s, school systems were pressured to use Texas-approved textbooks that were designed to comply with the teach-to-the-test mindset fostered by the Reagan administration’s “A Nation at Risk” campaign.
After the House Bill 1017, known as the Education Reform Act of 1990, however, our teachers saw incremental improvements in teaching and learning – even in government classes. But, the Bush administration’s No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and the Obama administration’s Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 especially undercut civics instruction.
As districts were forced to focus on math and reading test scores, social studies was largely ignored.
Although I was actively involved in resisting data-driven, competition-driven reforms, I must admit that I was too diplomatic when defending civics. I silently worried that our abandonment of social studies could be the most destructive result of corporate school reforms. But I was reluctant to criticize colleagues who gave up on the fight, and I didn’t say aloud that our failure to teach government and history could help undermine American democracy.
Today, however, our democracy is clearly in danger. At a time, for instance, when a president claims that he can seek a third term and seems to think he can ignore federal courts, a solid understanding of the Constitution is necessary.
Moreover, today’s students are anxious and feel disengaged and powerless in a world challenged by rapid changes in the climate, demography and technology.
Fortunately, Lindsey Cormack’s “How to Raise a Citizen (And Why It’s Up to You to Do It)” gives me hope. She offers practical – and bipartisan – approaches for discussing political issues and governmental processes that are very similar to what worked in John Marshall classrooms.
And guess what? Cormack doesn’t dump the entire challenge on schools and educators.  Cormack builds on the traditions of parents taking on the role of discussing government and politics at the dinner table and encouraging their children to get involved in community and local government activities.
The book reminds me about the ways my high school students, their communities and I taught each other how to actively participate in our democracy. Our academics shifted focus during presidential or mid-term elections, or when state or local politics dominated the headlines, or even when extreme events, like the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11, or wars in Iraq and Afghanistan occurred.
When English classes started reading Ralph Ellison’s “The Invisible Man,” I would teach about his experiences growing up in Oklahoma City. The students were especially insightful when guest lecturers visited, and during field trips to places like art museums, the “Deep Deuce,” where Ellison grew up, and the state Capitol. This was especially true when a veteran of the Sit-In movement joined us in repeated trips to the Capitol. Legislators were always enthralled by the students’ wisdom.
Above all, student saw high-level instruction as a sign of respect, and responded by learning in a holistic and meaningful way.
But in recent years, I’ve seen a shift in how we teach because of corporate school reformers teach-to-the-test mandates.
It was only a few years ago, I was so hopeful that schools, families and communities would come together so we could nurture a commitment to civics education and our 21st century democracy.
Now, I worry that our failures to teach civics and history have helped undermine our society’s commitment to political institutions.
I fear lawmakers will be unable to gather the courage to stand up to rightwing attacks on schools by state Superintendent Ryan Walters and his supporters that aim to mandate history standards such as “identifying discrepancies in the 2020 election,” the “halting of ballot-counting in select cities,” “the security risks of mail-in balloting” and “the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
I’m also concerned that our leaders won’t have the gumption to push back against the Trump administration’s focus on defunding promising education and nonprofit programs.
Because it will take a village and diverse strategies to build on our communities’ strengths and to raise and educate our children.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Hundreds of child care providers and parents rallied outside the state Capitol Wednesday, then headed inside to buttonhole lawmakers of both parties, urging support for a $480 million provision in the next state budget for Wisconsin’s child care providers.
“Child care is not a luxury, it’s not a nice-to-have,” said Claire Lindstrom, an Eau Claire parent who addressed the rally. “It is infrastructure.”
“We’re here today because the people who are doing this very important work can no longer afford to hold up a broken system,” said Toshiba Adams, an instructor and instructional chair in early childhood education at Milwaukee Area Technical College.

The rally and afternoon visit with legislators followed a morning gathering of the participants at the nearby Concourse Hotel that included talks by lawmakers, parents and providers. At noon 350 or more people — the largest action by child care advocates in recent memory — marched from the hotel to the rally, with chants of “Kids first, families first, invest in child care now.”
The crowd massed on the Capitol building’s west steps for a half hour of speeches.
Lindstrom broke down the average cost for child care. A single parent paid the minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, “would have to work 43 full-time weeks just to cover one year of infant care,” she said. A family making the median income in Wisconsin — about $75,000 a year — will probably spend 20% of their earnings on care for a single child.
“If they have two kids, an infant and a 4-year-old, they’re spending over a third of their income just to go to work,” Lindstrom said. “This is not a personal budgeting issue. That’s a broken system.”
Gov. Tony Evers has proposed $480 million in the state’s 2025-27 budget that would go to licensed child care providers, replenishing the state’s Child Care Counts program funded from federal pandemic relief. Without that, Child Care Counts will expire for good in June.
At its height between 2021 and 2023, Child Care Counts was credited with stabilizing Wisconsin’s providers, who shared in payments totaling $20 million a month. Providers reported that with the money they were able to raise wages for child care workers while holding down increases in the fees that parents paid.
“Our early childhood educators are trained in how to support brain development, emotional regulation, and school readiness,” Lindstrom said. “We expect them to do this important work and yet we pay them less than workers at Kwik Trip and Culver’s.”
Evers, a Democrat, was unable to persuade the Legislature’s Republican majority to extend the program in the state’s 2023-25 budget. He repurposed other federal funds, and the total payment was reduced to $10 million a month. That will run out in June.
Providers, advocates and early childhood education experts have argued that only with an ongoing investment like Child Care Counts can providers pay child care workers adequately without pricing care out of reach for the average family.
“We need child care for our communities to function,” Lindstrom said. “We can no longer afford to treat this like a personal problem. It’s a public domain. And the solution is clear. We need to fund child care.”
A survey report released April 10 found that up to 25% of Wisconsin providers said they might close without continued support along the lines of Child Care Counts. More than one-third said they might have to reduce the number of children then could serve for lack of staff.
Large majorities said they might have to cut pay and that they expect to have more difficulty recruiting workers. More than half said they expect some employees to quit and that providing high quality care would become more difficult.

“We will see dramatically less care available in virtually every single county in the state,” Ruth Schmidt, executive director of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association, told the crowd. “Is that acceptable?”
“No!” the crowd roared back in reply.
“Is it acceptable that moms will have to consider leaving the workforce in record numbers because you cannot work if you cannot afford or find child care? Is it acceptable that stressed out parents doing the best they can will have no support from the state to ensure that they can work and contribute to our tax base?”
With each question the rallygoers responded with resounding shouts of “No!”
Sachin Shivaram, CEO of Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc, told the crowd that businesses should support state funding for child care.
His company pays employees with young children $400 a month toward their child care costs, he said. When the crowd applauded, he thanked them, then added, “but I also feel very embarrassed. … That’s so little, and the cost of child care is, you know, several thousand dollars a month, and this is just barely scratching the surface.”
Shivaram pointed out the state manufacturing tax credit that his company receives, along with all Wisconsin manufacturers.

“And guess what? We have to do absolutely nothing to get that tax credit,” he said. “We don’t have to invest in any capital equipment, we don’t have to train any workers, we don’t have to give back to the community, nothing. You know, how about we make that tax credit contingent on helping the child care situation?”
In an interview after the legislative visits Schmidt of WECA said the hundreds who took part went to almost every state Senate office and about 90% of the Assembly members’ offices as well. WECA organized the event along with Wisconsin Head Start Association and Raising Wisconsin — an advocacy campaign that WECA and allied groups launched in 2022.
“We really wanted this to be nonpartisan,” Schmidt said — “just an opportunity to tell stories and share, from a real perspective, from the heart what’s going on with this industry.”
Some of those conversations — with leaders in the Legislature who advocates have already spoken to about the budget request — were “not necessarily a surprise,” she acknowledged.  
With other lawmakers, she added, including some of the 30 first-term Assembly members elected in November as well as others who have not served on committees where child care has been an agenda item, “there was a lot of interest in just learning,”
The visits were an opportunity for personal testimony to reach lawmakers and their staff, Schmidt said. “The power of having parents tell their stories, and the power of having educators tell their stories about how they’ve been using the public funding when it’s available — it was very compelling.”

With an asking price of $50 million, the 55,136 acres could rake in the biggest sum ever for a Nebraska ranch.
Located in the nation’s No. 1 cow county — and including nine miles of the Snake River, eight miles of Gordon Creek, 26 solar wells, 79 windmills, 20-plus artesian flowing wells and an airplane hangar — the property has grabbed the attention of potential buyers from numerous states.
But not all are happy with the idea of the sale.
 Not all want to sell 

Some members of the Abbott family, which bought the property from the Metzgers over a half-century ago, object to letting go of the ranch where whitetail and mule deer run, walleye and trout fishing is common, and the Ogallala Aquifer nourishes grassy meadows for acres.
Chris, who has been the ranch’s main steward, wants to hold onto the operation, but the majority of the five brothers and sisters who are major shareholders have voted to sell and focus on other areas of their lives.
It’s an emotional struggle that, without discussing specifics of the ranch, Nebraska State Sen. Tanya Storer said many Sandhills natives can relate to.

“Being part of a multigenerational ranch family myself, sometimes even selling a specific pasture can be emotional,” said Storer, who lives in Cherry County.
She says the ranch is a cornerstone of the north-central Nebraska region, with the Abbott family legacy entrenched not only in the cattle but banking industries. While new owners are always welcome, Storer said, the bond is “really never the same” as with families that have grown up together, branded together and have run to each other’s aid when fires or other ranch tragedies hit.
“It’s the interwovenness of the experience, the culture of what we do,” said the lawmaker from Whitman.
Mike Abbott, who at age 67 is the youngest of the siblings and among those ready to sell, said he wouldn’t change any of his ranch experiences, including 4-H and riding horseback to a one-room schoolhouse. 
He recalls his mom and dad, Art and Patricia, buying the ranch from Woodrow Metzger in 1969. Mike was about 10 years old then, though generations of the Abbotts have lived in the area since the turn of the 20th Century.
“Yep, that was my childhood,” said Mike, president of the corporation that owns the property. “Then, ranching provided well for my family. But it was different for my three kids.”

He called ranching “a changing industry,” and said his own three children have ventured into other work. The sale of the ranch should allow Abbott family members to support younger generations in their endeavors, he said.
 ‘Mama cow’ country 

Marketing the ranch for sale is Hall and Hall, a brokerage firm based in the county seat of Valentine. 
Agent Mark Johnson said torn feelings are commonplace in his business and can be magnified with multigenerational ranch land. He also worked on the recent sale of the Dumbbell Ranch, which was mostly situated in Cherry County and attracted national attention for its quirky name, rich history and size of 15,500 acres.
In that case, the two siblings who controlled the Dumbbell, despite sentimental attachment, agreed on selling. One sibling was immersed in a computer career in Colorado, and his sister was about to get married again. 
Her daughters had more pressing interests than to oversee the operation and, as Anne Anderson Bennet said at the time: “We love the Sandhills. Our family loves ranching. It’s time to move on.”
Even larger, the Metzger Ranch, also known as the Abbott Ranch, is a “rock” in the county known for having the most cows in the United States, Johnson said, calling Cherry County the best place for a “mama cow.”
Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Nebraska, and cattle production represents the largest segment of the industry, according to the Nebraska Beef Council.
  The ranch is centrally located between Valentine, Gordon and Hyannis, say brokers, who describe it as one of the earliest ranches in the Sandhills. (Courtesy of Hall and Hall)
“Just the sheer size of it is extremely notable,” Johnson said of the Abbott property. His team, whose expertise is in ranches, believes the asking price surpasses all other Nebraska ranches to date. 
Since hitting the market earlier this month, Johnson said, he’s fielded interest from people in Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Wyoming and Montana. He said they include land investors and ranchers, some attracted to the subirrigated land where drought is not as common and others who feel pushed out of their current regions by non-agricultural development.
He suspects potential buyers will see an opportunity to invest in a “hard asset” versus the stock market.
The cows aren’t included in the price tag, but the real estate listing shows the ranch as a 2,500-head cow/calf year-round operation. Included in the sale are five homes, a bunkhouse. There’s a horse barn, cattle working facilities and other outbuildings.
“Rarely do ranches of such large acreage and quality come to market,” says the Hall and Hall web site. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for anyone who dreams of a future in land ownership and cattle production.”
Land with long ties

After News Channel Nebraska reported the real estate listing, the family sent a statement from the children of Chris Abbott, who described their dad as the decades-long main steward of the ranch.
A.J. and Carver Abbott and Alicia Abbott Clark said in the statement that their dad, who they said grew the cow herd and land mass, would never vote to sell the ranch. They said his four siblings did vote to sell, and one has since “retracted.”
“The cattle, hills, meadows, trees, river ground, summer pastures, windmills, fence lines, etc., run deep in our Dad’s soul. As a working rancher since he was a child, Chris has developed pride, respect and callouses,” they wrote. 
The three said many have reached out to them, and they wanted people to know that all was done to try and convince the “on-paper majority owners” not to sell.
Their hope, they said, is that “someone with a whole hell of a lot of money and vision will hear about what is going on and will partner in the ranch, or that Dad’s siblings will accept our lease offer.”

Mike Abbott said he and wife Pam want the next owner to “value and appreciate all the natural resources the land can offer and be exceptional stewards to it.”
“My favorite memories were working alongside my dad all those years, no matter the task,” the youngest sibling said. His dad, Art, passed away in 1986 and mom, Patricia (Frank), died in 2009.
 Hard decision 

Storer said her heart hurts for any family that, for whatever reason, closes a ranching chapter.

“There is something unique about the Sandhills. It becomes part of you,” she said.  “If and when you have to separate from that, it certainly leaves an empty spot in your soul.”
Mike Abbott expects some of the Abbott family to remain in the area after a sale. His sisters and major shareholders are Andrea Berger, Diane Shadbolt and Helen Feller. Grandchildren have expanded the number of stakeholders in the ranch.
He didn’t want to discuss or add to any conflict, but he said a sale would get more complicated over time, and now seemed the best way for most involved. 
“This was a very very hard decision,” said Mike Abbott.  “We’ve got to move forward.”

Two days after the House passed a separate measure to require primary elections, Republicans and Democrats challenged the addition of $8 million on the House floor to reimburse county election commissions for holding primaries. 
The push for primaries stems from political division in Williamson and Maury counties where far-right groups want to hold caucuses rather than primaries to determine Republican nominees for local elections. Caucuses are gatherings of political party members to select nominees for elections, as opposed to primaries in which voters go to the polls.
The bill requiring primaries was presented as having no impact on the state budget, critics said. 
Yet Republican Rep. Ryan Williams of Cookeville introduced the budget amendment Wednesday on the House floor, drawing immediate opposition from Republicans and Democrats before it passed 57-30.

Democratic Rep. Jason Powell of Nashville blamed Republican lawmakers for trying to inject the money late in the budget process to impact elections.
“This is a drastic change to the way we have conducted elections for a very long time in our state,” Powell said.
Republican Rep. Todd Warner of Chapel Hill in Maury County, where Republicans have held caucuses, was more adamant, saying he and other lawmakers were told the cost of the primary requirement bill was not significant.
“We were lied to in committee. We were lied to about this bill,” Warner said. He later added that the Senate’s budget discussions showed the money was added to pay for the primary bill.
Williams responded by saying the measure was “simply an appropriation” to local governments to pay for primaries. House Speaker Cameron Sexton backed him up, saying the money was needed to reimburse counties that have held primary elections already.
The Republican-controlled House defeated several attempts by Democrats to amend the budget to add items such as a grocery sales tax cut and shift expenses such as $120 million for private-school vouchers, $113 million for charter school administration and $4.5 million for 10 positions within the Attorney General’s Office to a fund to fix potholes on state highways. Another amendment would have moved more than $5 million for the state’s new immigration “czar” to cut waste and fraud.
Crunching the numbers
Of the $59.7 billion budget, which takes effect July 1, about $30 million comes from state revenue and nearly $20 billion from the federal government.
Lawmakers took $179 million from the governor’s supplemental budget and put it toward 181 requests for legislation or spending in their districts.
The legislature also created a $42.5 million grant pool for volunteer fire departments, rescue squads, emergency medical services, senior centers, courthouses and museums and Second Harvest Food Bank, which suffered federal funding cuts
Republicans lauded the budgetary work, but Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville said the past two GOP governors, including Gov. Bill Lee, have been living “high on the hog,” doubling Tennessee’s budget without improving people’s lives while giving tax breaks to out-of-state companies through the franchise and excise break. He predicted the state would hit a “fiscal crisis” in the next five years, in part because of a private-school voucher “scam.”
“This governor’s the single worst governor in the state of Tennessee’s history,” Clemmons said to a mix of cheers and jeers.
Clemmons also said a line can be drawn from Lee to his donors and state contracts, though he did not give details.
Republican leaders responded by saying Tennessee has the lowest debt per capita in the nation, in addition to a low tax burden. 
Williams, chairman of the House finance subcommittee, countered, saying lawmakers had to cut more than $1 billion worth of state spending 15 years ago because the state was poorly managed by Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen.
House finance Chairman Gary Hicks said the state has spent recurring revenue on non-recurring items, those that are to be funded for only one year, enabling it to maintain a “significant balance” at the start of each year. 
  “This governor’s the single worst governor in the state of Tennessee’s history,” said House Democratic Caucus Chair John Ray Clemmons of Nashville on Wednesday. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Tax growth is slowing in the state’s general fund, zero growth this year and only 2% next year, which will generate $376 million, according to Hicks.
State Departments reverted $1.5 billion in unspent funds in fiscal 2024, leaving them to be spent on next year’s budget, he said.
The next budget also includes $700 million in interest earnings on federal funds the state received for COVID pandemic relief.
Major expenditures include $597 million for disaster relief, $640 million in new funding for K-12 education, including $198 million for one-time teacher bonuses connected to the private-school voucher vote early this year. 
Higher education is netting $264 million more for universities, higher pay and benefits and capital improvements.
New spending of $1.5 billion for health and social services is part of the budget, as well, including TennCare shared savings between the state and federal government. It involves $78 million for rural hospitals, uncompensated care and $4 million for county health department projects.
The legislature is borrowing $1 billion to go toward road projects, a departure from state policy to pay for infrastructure with gas taxes.

(Phil McKenna/Inside Climate News)CAMERON — For a ship the length of nearly three football fields, Energy Intelligence seemed to turn on a dime. With tugboats pushing and pulling at its bow and stern, the 295-meter liquefied natural gas tanker pivoted 180 degrees in the brackish waters of the Calcasieu Ship Channel in late February, preparing to refuel for a trip to the Netherlands.
Its journey is part of a seismic shift that in the past decade has seen the U.S. go from an LNG importer to the world’s largest exporter, fueled by an ongoing boom in hydraulically fractured natural gas. New U.S. export terminals and expansions currently under construction will nearly double existing export capacity in the coming years, while even more projects have been approved.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Scientists have warned that LNG production involves significant greenhouse gas emissions at every step in the process, from methane leaks at wells to the burning of the gas by end users. But there’s been little attention to the impact of emissions from the tankers that ship LNG from the U.S. to other countries.
That too is substantial, an Inside Climate News analysis found. A single year of greenhouse gas emissions from tankers carrying LNG from the United States more than cancels out the annual emissions reductions achieved through all the electric vehicles currently on U.S. roads.
To estimate the climate pollution from vessels exporting U.S. LNG, Inside Climate News analyzed federal export data, information from the International Gas Union on the ships’ capacities and propulsion systems and ship tracking data supplied by the maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic.
The first-of-its-kind analysis totaled emissions for two one-year periods: between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018, shortly after large-scale exports from the U.S. began with the opening of the Sabine Pass export facility in Louisiana, and again between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024.
The perilous links between Ukraine’s energy future and Louisiana

Inside Climate News found that total greenhouse gas emissions more than quadrupled from about 4.1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent for 224 return journeys in 2017-2018 to around 18.4 million tons for 1,265 journeys in 2023-2024. To put the latter figure in perspective: It equals the annual greenhouse gas reductions from swapping 5.8 million gasoline-powered vehicles with an equal number of electric vehicles.
That’s around 50% more than all the light-duty EVs currently registered in the United States.
It’s “a big deal,” said Mark Brownstein, the Environmental Defense Fund’s energy transition senior vice president.
“Methane from human activities drives nearly a third of the warming that the planet is experiencing right now,” he said. “Every molecule of methane, whether lost at the well site, the pipeline, the ship or the power plant is working to accelerate warming at a time when the climate crisis is bearing down on countries around the world.”
The Inside Climate News analysis drew on methods described in a scientific study published in 2023, which accounted for the age of each ship, its specific propulsion system, the distance the tanker traveled, the capacity of its LNG tanks and the time each ship spent maneuvering and docked.
Importantly, these calculations accounted for both the release of CO2 from vessels’ engines and emissions of unburned methane that passes through the engines of tankers that are fueled by gas boiling off from their cargo tanks. Across the entire fleet involved in U.S. exports of LNG, this “methane slip” accounted for more than half of all CO2-equivalent emissions.
Methane, the primary component of LNG, is the second leading driver of climate change after carbon dioxide. On a pound for pound basis, it’s far more effective than CO2 at warming the planet in the 20 years after it’s released. And because methane remains in the atmosphere for a relatively short amount of time compared to carbon dioxide, reducing methane emissions is widely viewed as the fastest way to combat climate change.
The portion of emissions from shipping is modest relative to the total climate pollution associated with LNG. A recent peer-reviewed study suggests that shipping accounts for 6 percent of LNG-associated greenhouse gas emissions, with the vast majority coming from production wells and end use, when gas is burned for heating or to produce electricity.
The study concluded that the total climate pollution associated with exported U.S. LNG is higher than that of coal produced in the importing countries. Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a group that supports the natural gas industry, funded a July 2024 report that did not go through academic peer review and came to the opposite conclusion.
Putting the ICN finding in the context of vehicle use makes it all the more striking, said Ade Samuel, an energy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
“When you compare it to these numbers of the emissions released from gasoline-powered vehicles, I think it really gives you a sense for how significant the emissions of LNG on the full lifecycle basis are,” Samuel said.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry, and Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future both declined to comment on the ICN analysis.

Out of sight, out of mind
While much has been made of methane releases at wells, pipelines and compressor stations in recent years, emissions of methane and CO2 from ships transporting LNG have gone largely unnoticed. Part of the reason is the physical distance of tankers at sea from human observers.
A gap in satellite capabilities is also partly to blame. Satellites can easily detect plumes of methane from oil and gas facilities on land, but the technique, which relies on bouncing light off the ground, has proved more challenging over water.
In addition, tankers passing through international waters occupy an accountability “no man’s land” when it comes to quantifying both the release of methane and CO2 from ships, said Alison Kirsch, a senior energy analyst for the Sierra Club.
“Shipping emissions are not really taken into account by either the exporting country or the importing country,” Kirsch said. “The shipping phase of emissions sort of falls to the wayside.”
The Inside Climate News analysis also revealed a secondary reason for the increased emissions in 2023-2024, beyond the rapid ramp-up in exports: Tankers are making longer journeys to countries in Asia and the west coast of South America, due to companies increasingly routing LNG vessels around the southern tip of South America or South Africa rather than passing through the Panama Canal. Drought–induced low water levels in the canal limited ship traffic through the waterway starting in early 2023.
One vessel bound for Singapore, meanwhile, turned around in the Mediterranean and headed around the tip of South Africa rather than passing through the Suez Canal in November 2023, shortly after Houthi rebels in Yemen began to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. GasLog Partners, the owner of the vessel, did not respond to requests for comment.

Journeys to Taiwan, China and Japan were 13 to 16 percent longer in 2023-2024 than in 2017-2018, while trips to Chile were 31 percent longer. Still, these disruptions to shipping added roughly half a million metric tons to estimated emissions, dwarfed by the vast growth in climate pollution caused by the five-fold explosion in the number of export journeys.
While already poised to continue growing, U.S. LNG exports and their associated emissions may soon expand even further. President Donald Trump pledged to fast-track the approval of additional LNG export capacity and is already making good on his word.
Since he took office, his administration has announced approvals for four large LNG projects, including Calcasieu Pass 2 and Commonwealth LNG, both adjacent to the existing terminal on the Calcasieu Ship Channel, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
It’s not clear whether there’s enough demand for the additional LNG export capacity. Tariffs levied by the Trump administration have already resulted in a pause on U.S. LNG imports by China, the world’s largest buyer of the fuel. However, other countries, including Japan, India, Taiwan and Ukraine have pledged to increase imports of U.S. LNG.
Whatever happens, “we need to take a look at this from the point of view of reducing methane emissions and doing whatever we can to make that happen,” said Kirsten Sinclair Rosselot, a chemical engineer and environmental performance analyst who runs the consultancy Process Profiles and was the lead author of the 2023 study that assessed greenhouse gas emissions from individual LNG tankers. “But the end goal is to transition off of fossil fuels, which would eliminate the need for shipping LNG in the first place.”
How methane escapes when LNG is shipped
LNG is natural gas that has been super-cooled to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature so cold the fuel changes from a gas to a liquid. Liquifying the gas shrinks its volume, allowing LNG tankers to carry approximately 600 times more fuel within their holds than if the fuel remained a gas.
Ships like the Energy Intelligence have thick insulating walls to help keep the LNG cool. However, even with insulation, a portion of the fuel boils off, turning back into a gas. While some boil-off gas may escape the ship as “fugitive emissions” released into the atmosphere, most of the gas is captured and routed to the ship’s engines to power the vessel.
For a ship’s primary engines, which propel it forward, the amount of unburned methane is low, approximately 2 percent of the total gas that passes through the engine. However, for the auxiliary engines that generate electricity for lighting and other electrical needs on the ship, methane slip can be much higher. This is because auxiliary engines are typically run at low capacity, or “load,” a state at which they do not operate efficiently.
“Where you really see the slip onboard is in the generators,” Rosselot said. “They run the generators at low load, and methane slip is horrific at low load.”
More than 15% of the gas that enters an auxiliary engine can pass through the generator unburned when the engines are run at low loads, according to a study published in 2022. The finding was recently confirmed by the Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII), an industry group whose members include oil giants Chevron, Shell and TotalEnergies, plus several of the largest LNG shipping companies, including MOL, Maran Gas, Seapeak and Knutsen OAS.
Greenhouse gases from proposed Venture Global site concern Calcasieu neighbors

“Despite recent progress, methane slip is the key component of onboard emissions,” MAMII stated in a report published in July. The report noted that methane releases “constitute a major risk” for the industry but added that existing technology “can reduce methane slip to a negligible, if not zero, amount.”
“This is solvable,” said Panos Mitrou, MAMII chairman and global gas segment director for Lloyd’s Register, which provides technical advice for the shipping industry. “I think it’s possible to come to a stage where LNG fuel ships, or energy carrying ships, will be what we call ‘methane proof.’ They will have minimal, negligible methane emissions.”
One method to reduce the rate of methane slip suggested in the report is to simply run fewer generators at higher loads. Ship operators typically run multiple generators as a built-in backup to ensure a steady power supply in case one of the generators fails.
The industry report suggested batteries could replace redundant generators as a backup source of power. Another suggested solution was “shaft generators,” devices that harness the rotational motion of the main engine to generate electricity.
To hasten emissions reductions, MAMII went a step further, calling for industry-wide regulations. “It is vital that regulators implement a clear, robust, and focused regulatory framework as soon as possible to incentivise technology development and uptake,” the report stated.
Since January 2024, the European Union has required LNG vessels and other large ships entering EU ports to monitor and report their climate pollution, including methane. Shipping companies will have to pay for excessive methane emissions starting in 2026.
More efforts to reduce that pollution are underway. The United Nations’ International Maritime Organization approved draft regulations April 11 that would put a price on greenhouse gas emissions for the global shipping industry.
However, the global framework is less stringent than the European rules and will not meet the UN agency’s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping 30 percent by 2030, said Bryan Comer, the marine program director for the International Council on Clean Transportation.
“We made some progress on decarbonizing maritime shipping, but ultimately, what was agreed this week falls short of IMO’s own goal,” Comer said.
The LNG industry is going to have to rein in methane and carbon pollution, not just on the high seas but from extraction to use, if its exports will “play any kind of constructive role in meeting global energy demands,” said Brownstein, with the Environmental Defense Fund.
Those exports don’t show any sign of slowing down. After unloading its fuel in the Netherlands, Energy Intelligence returned to Calcasieu Pass, ready to ferry its next load of fuel across the Atlantic.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas General Assembly on Wednesday approved legislation to increase the state’s general revenue budget to $6.49 billion for fiscal year 2026, a nearly 3% increase from the previous year. 
As is typical, state lawmakers approved the Revenue Stabilization Act on the final day of the legislative session through two identical bills — Senate Bill 637 and House Bill 2003.
The RSA is nearly identical to the budget Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders proposed in November. The largest portion of the $182.5 million increase to the state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is an additional $90 million for the state’s Educational Freedom Account program.

The school voucher program, which permits state funds to be used for allowable expenses such as private school tuition, is expected to see an increase in participation during its third year, when eligibility opens up to all Arkansas students this fall.
The legislation also increases county jail reimbursement by roughly $9 million to $34.8 million. The state reimburses county jails for holding state inmates when there’s no room in Arkansas prisons. Expanding prison capacity has been a priority for Sanders, but lawmakers failed this session to approve a $750 million appropriation bill to support the full estimated cost of a planned prison in Franklin County. 
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, sponsored that bill and told colleagues the estimated total cost of the proposed 3,000-bed penitentiary is $825 million, but several lawmakers said they believe the cost will top $1 billion and were unhappy that the administration couldn’t provide more details on the project. Franklin County residents have also objected to the prison’s location and to the state’s purchase of the property without involving local officials. 
In the House Tuesday, Joint Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Lane Jean, R-Magnolia, highlighted a $13 million increase to the Department of Human Services Grants line item, which he said would support maternal health. 
Sanders in her proposed budget called for a $13 million increase for Medicaid to help support recommendations from the Strategic Committee for Maternal Health that she convened last year to address the state’s poor maternal health outcomes. 
Arkansas has among the nation’s highest maternal and infant mortality rates, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Arkansas is the only state to have taken no action on a federal option to expand Medicaid postpartum benefits to 12 months from the current 60 days. Sanders has refused to expand coverage, saying to do so would be duplicative of other health insurance options for new mothers.
The RSA also includes $3.15 million for a performance fund that Jean said would support the governor’s new state employee pay plan, which is expected to cost a total of $139 million. Lawmakers last month approved legislation for the plan, which aims to clarify promotion ladders within state agencies and improve recruitment and retention by raising some salaries to labor market rates. State agency leaders should be able to accommodate the updated pay schedule within existing budgets, the governor said last fall.


Let us know what you think...


 

Jean told the House Tuesday that the RSA projects the state would be left with roughly $300,000 in surplus funds, though he noted that would likely be closer to $250,000 because $50,000 would be allocated for highways. That is significantly less than the record billion-dollar surpluses seen in recent years. The decrease in surplus funds could be contributed, in part, to several rounds of tax cuts by Arkansas’ last two governors. Sanders and the Legislature cut taxes three times in 15 months, most recently last June. 
To further support the governor’s proposed budget, lawmakers also approved Senate Bill 636 Wednesday, which would transfer $572.79 million in surplus money to various funds and set-aside accounts. 
“It’s spending a lot of money, I’m not debating that point, but I think it’s all needs that the governor came up with. House got some needs that we asked for, Senate’s got some needs,” Jean said Wednesday.
SB 636 includes an additional $90 million for the EFA program and $100 million for the Medicaid Sustainability Set Aside Fund, among other things. When Sanders proposed these set-aside funds in November, State Budget Director Robert Brech noted they would only be used if necessary and are not part of the RSA, which prioritizes state government spending and balances the budget. 
“It’s not known at this time if those will be necessary,” Brech said then. “In the event they are, those set-asides could be used and then built into the budget afterwards, but what we didn’t want to do is put too much money in the RSA when it wasn’t needed.”
A worksheet for surplus funding and set-asides for the 2025-2027 biennium presented to the Joint Budget Committee Monday also proposed transferring $250 million to a correctional facilities fund through Senate Bill 633. That bill was pulled down Monday.

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

The Tennessee Senate Wednesday voted 70-23 in favor of the legislation  (SB227/HB11) brought by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, both Republicans. 
The Republican majority in the House approved the measure earlier this month.
Tennessee Senate OKs bill to hold charities liable for aiding immigrants who later commit crime

A spokesperson for Gov. Bill Lee did not respond to a question sent Wednesday about whether he plans to sign the legislation into law. 
Grills called the measure a “public safety bill in keeping with the Trump Administration’s renewed focus on illegal immigration.”
“What we’re doing with this bill is anyone who is a victim of a crime committed by an illegal alien would have a private right of action against any NGO (non-governmental organization) that has assisted the illegal alien with housing in the community,” Grills said in presenting the bill on the Senate floor.
The legislation would open the door to civil lawsuits against charities that provide a variety of long-term housing assistance to individuals regardless of their immigration status, including assistance in signing leases or securing an apartment.
The bill exempts “temporary overnight housing such as that provided by a homeless shelter,” but includes no specific exemption for other short-term housing, such as domestic violence shelters, which can house victims and their children for months at a time. 
Bills that target immigrant-serving nonprofits raise criticism from faith community 

Charities would be subject to lawsuits if their “conduct in providing housing constitutes negligence, gross negligence, or willful and wanton misconduct.” The bill’s language does not include a definition of those terms in the context of providing physical housing, referrals for housing or assistance in signing apartment leases.
The measure has drawn pushback from Tennessee faith leaders as an infringement on their religious freedom to perform acts of charity to those in need. 
On the Senate floor earlier this month, the bill drew contentious debate, with Democrat Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville criticizing the measure as holding charities responsible for “crimes committed by someone they helped” while Taylor — the bill’s sponsor — called it a “misguided mission” to serve immigrants without legal status. 
House Republicans quickly moved for a vote Wednesday, forestalling any floor debate, even as Democrats audibly protested the maneuver.

(Getty Images)For the past six years, I worked as a public defender in Ada County, representing people in child protection, misdemeanor and felony cases. Even though the work was often mentally and emotionally taxing, I found a sense of purpose and community in it, and I took great pride in giving people a fair chance in court if they couldn’t afford an attorney on their own.
However, I resigned in November of last year without having another job lined up because the changes to the public defense system made it impossible for me to do my job. 
Idaho governor approves increase in state public defense budget

Last October, Idaho transitioned the oversight of public defense away from being managed by each county to the singular Office of the State Public Defender in Boise. This changeover has been underfunded and mismanaged, directly leading to violations of defendants’ constitutional rights, the mass exodus of attorneys and staff, and increased caseloads for those who stayed. It has not remedied the ongoing problems that led the ACLU of Idaho to sue the state in 2015. 
The statewide overhaul was Idaho’s solution to the lawsuit filed 10 years ago against the state demanding Idaho overhaul the public defense system because it was not adequately meeting the demands of people needing an attorney assigned to them by the court. The transition to the state public defender system was supposed to improve the situation, but so far, things have only gotten worse.
In the months leading up to the transition, public defense staff were apprehensive about the changes because our basic questions still had no answers. Will we still have access to the jail and prison to visit our clients? Will our emails change? Are we expected to travel to other counties?
Rather than answer those questions, the state announced significant pay cuts for employees in July 2024, affecting those who had dedicated years of service to public defense, with some cuts reaching as high as $40,000 a year. This led to a change in our working conditions, turning from a supportive environment to one filled with tension and uncertainty, prompting a wave of resignations. In addition to the pay cuts, the state’s poorly executed rollout of new technology last September left public defenders unable to communicate with clients in jail for a month, further hampering our ability to provide an adequate defense. 
Despite this, the leadership at the Office of the State Public Defender has issued statements minimizing concerns about staffing shortages and mismanagement, failing to address the mounting issues and leaving attorneys and staff overwhelmed by higher workloads, bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies. The gap between defendants and their constitutional right to an attorney continued to grow wider.
While I have sympathy for such a daunting task as overhauling a state’s public defense system, patience only goes so far when the leaders of the clearly underfunded and rushed overhaul seem impervious to feedback, ignoring legitimate complaints and severe shortages.
Idaho’s elected leaders must acknowledge the crisis our public defense system is in and remedy it. 
When I made the difficult choice to leave, it was because I lost hope that the situation would improve. I still struggle with the guilt of feeling like I abandoned my clients, and the guilt of knowing my departure made it even that much more difficult for the attorneys who remain, trying to serve clients amidst the chaos. My mental health was suffering, my clients were suffering, my colleagues were suffering, and we were all being told there was no problem. 
This is simply unacceptable. 
This must be addressed. We are absolutely in crisis mode. 
Step one is to acknowledge the rollout of the SPD has been fraught with mistakes and mismanagement. Step two is to fix it. Step three is to create a system of transparency and good leadership to oversee the system moving forward. 
We cannot wait any longer for a fix. Every day that does not happen is another day too many more Idahoans are robbed of their constitutional rights. I am begging our elected officials to act immediately to address this severe crisis.

As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Indiana Republican leadership seems as opposed as ever to marijuana legalization. In fact, this year bills are moving to ban advertising the illegal product in the state.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
Headed for the ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.

Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.














There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher





Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Photo:John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee House Republicans  voted overwhelmingly to transfer responsibilities for investigating discrimination complaints to the office of the Tennessee Attorney General, effectively dissolving the Tennessee Human Rights Commission. 
The measure passed 73-23 with less than 10 minutes of discussion. 
Democrats questioned Rep. Johnny Garrett, a Goodlettsville Republican who sponsored the bill, about the need to dismantle the independent agency and raised doubts about the ability of Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti to investigate complaints without bias. 
“For some reason, I think the politics that have already infected the AG’s office will also make its way into Title VI and other public policies enforced by the Human Rights Commission,” said Rep. G.A. Hardaway, a Memphis Democrat. “I can think of no reason to move (investigative capacity) except to make it susceptible to the politics of the AG’s office.”
Title VI refers to federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities that receive federal funding, including state government.
Bill to abolish discrimination watchdog agency advances in Tennessee Legislature

Skrmetti has led or joined lawsuits that include a challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s rule prohibiting discrimination against women seeking abortions, litigation seeking to stop transgender medical care for minors and sent letters to corporations warning them against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among other actions.
Garrett said the only change to how claims of discrimination will be investigated is the move to a new Civil Rights Division within the attorney general’s office — although the legislature will lose the oversight authority it currently has over the Human Rights Commission.
Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Knoxville Democrat, called the attorney general’s office “a ginormous organization that’s getting fatter every day.”
The 2026 state budget, which the House passed earlier Wednesday, includes $4.5 million to expand the attorney general’s special litigation unit, which was created to investigate former President Joe Biden’s policies. Funding for the Human Rights Commission would also be transferred to the attorney general’s department should the bill become law.
The 60-year-old commission is a nonpartisan and independent agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodation as well as discrimination claims against the state of Tennessee.  
Under the measure, the commission will be dissolved by July 1 and its 30 staff positions will move to the attorney general’s office. 
The Senate version of the bill, sponsored by Huntingdon Republican Rep. John Stevens, is slated to go next to the Senate Calendar Committee. No date has been set for that but the legislature is expected to wrap up for the year in the next week.

Riley Moore, R-W.Va., toured the El Salvador prison CECOT on Tuesday, April 15, 2025, and posted a photo of himself giving two thumbs up in front of prisoners on his X account. (Rep. Riley Moore X account)If a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives and third generation member of a political dynasty taking a selfie and posing with double thumbs up while dressed in his business casual in front of stripped down inmates in a foreign country as part of a PR campaign for a controversial and legally suspect American policy to send more individuals there sounds wrong, it is because it is.
Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., took a trip away from his 2nd Congressional District of West Virginia and his Washington, D.C. office to El Salvador to get what is becoming a highly-sought photo-op for GOP members these days. Inside the CECOT prison with a background of caged inmates, Moore took a selfie, a posed picture with his thumbs up. To this he, or his social media intern, added two photos of inmates, a few lines about murderers and rapists, then, “I leave now even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts to secure our homeland” and posted it to his social media accounts. 
Not mentioned in the PR campaign is how CECOT is the lynchpin of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele’s political persona. Bukele’s rise to power was on the promise to crack down on crime, which as president he has mercilessly done while incarcerating tens of thousands in the process. Filling up CECOT with “brutal criminals, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles and terrorists” made him extremely popular. Which is step one in the dictator’s playbook. The following steps came next. Bukele consolidated power and popularity by going after “they” and “them” and “those” because how dare you quibble over due process and “rights” for gang members. Then came ignoring laws, marching armed soldiers into the Legislative Assembly, and serving his current term in direct violation of the constitution with some good, old fashioned court packing to approve it. 
CECOT isn’t just a prison; it’s a symbol of taking care of a problem — extremely high crime — and also a living warning that the crime can return, and anyone who dares question the methods of keeping all that bad at bay will find themselves in the mass cells themselves. “Without me, this” while pointing at the worst of the worst  is the power hungry dictator’s soundbite version of sine qua non. And far too often, as history shows again and again, it works.  
Easy to see why President Donald Trump is using CECOT as his tool of choice for the deportation policy he is pursuing. Bukele is walking proof of what history has shown again and again about responding to fear and how a strongman can capitalize on that fear. Immigration is Trump’s highest polling issue, even as his numbers continue to slip on everything else. The rhetoric of the two leaders has plenty of overlap, with the ends of stopping criminals justifying the means. Even when the means are legally suspect and innocent people become collateral damage. Thus the military planes instead of commercial airliners, the highly-produced videos of the deportations and brutal intake into CECOT, the obstinance against any pushback legal, moral or otherwise. The bad has to be bad enough to excuse the bad of how it is being done to otherwise good people who would just say “no, this is bad.”
The answers to any challenge will mirror those of Trump and Bukele, the surrogates in the media, and the army of social media accounts all falling in line to the policy without bothering with those sticky little details like the law, due process, and unintended consequences. Daring to bring those issues up means you are with the bad people, not with the good people. Bukele, who openly brags about being “the world’s coolest dictator” understands that popularity on one big issue brings power over all other issues. 
Holding a Master’s degree from National Defense University and having previously been a staffer for the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, it isn’t that Moore doesn’t know this background, or understand how dictatorships take hold, or couldn’t have dug deeper into why the Trump Administration is using El Salvador. It is well within his purview to do a fact-finding trip on the process and policy. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee Moore is positioned to have more influence, should he choose to use it, than the average freshman representative normally would, even members whose aunts aren’t the sitting senior U.S. Senator from the state represented. 
He just doesn’t care. Moore chose to be at the front of the line of the PR campaign posing with thumbs up in a brutal foreign prison instead of using his elected office to ask the basic and self-evident question: why our president was using CECOT in the first place. Moore pinned to the top of his X account that seeing the “brutal criminals, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and terrorists” leaves him “even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts.” The popularity of the policy to the base of his party is a path to his own future power, and why mess that up by bothering the electorate with lectures on laws and morals that go against their politically pliable feels?
Moore wanted to tell all of us something very important about himself with that El Salvador selfie. Believe him.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.

 States with largest share of K-12 budgets funded by federal government
Mississippi 23%
South Dakota 22%
Alaska 21%
Kentucky 20%
Louisiana 20%
North Carolina 20%
— Fiscal year 2022 data, National Center for Education Statistics 

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”

However, KDE has not paused or suspended any of its existing programs since receiving a request from the U.S. Department of Education to complete a form certifying its compliance with Trump administration interpretations of civil rights law. Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher also said the state department will continue working with its partners “to build an education system that is responsive and relentlessly focused on student success.”
In a letter to superintendents sent last weekend, Fletcher wrote that the U.S. Education Department’s certification form “is not without issues,” but he is still “confident that through our statewide commitment to providing opportunity and access for every student, we can advance towards meeting the needs and ensuring the success of each student in Kentucky’s public schools.” 
According to the federal agency’s form, “any violation of Title VI — including the use of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (‘DEI’) programs to advantage one’s race over another — is impermissible” and using “certain DEI practices can violate federal law.” The form outlines possible consequences — such as  losing federal funding or facing a federal lawsuit — for a state or local education agency that protects a DEI program. Title VI of the 1963 Civil Rights Act It prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. 
The U.S. Education Department asked the Kentucky department to distribute the certification forms to local school district officials for their signatures. Fletcher’s letter said all Kentucky school districts have “previously assured KDE of such compliance” and will do so annually in the future. 
“As previously recommended, school districts should consult with board counsel on whether the district will sign the Certification Form,” Fletcher wrote. 
The federal department’s targeting of DEI practices comes as Republicans at the national and state levels have pushed to roll back such measures, particularly in education. The GOP-controlled Kentucky General Assembly recently passed a law banning DEI programs at Kentucky public universities and colleges. Shortly after he assumed office in January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at eliminating DEI programs within the federal government. 
Backlash against DEI programs has grown since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in higher education admissions in 2023. The ruling is cited in the form the U.S. Department of Education is asking school officials to sign.. 
In general, DEI initiatives focus on supporting marginalized people in areas where they have been historically excluded. 
The U.S. Education Department previously threatened to rescind federal funding for schools in a February letter if they use DEI, or race-conscious practices, in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships and other resources for students. 
In a statement to the Kentucky Lantern, Fletcher said he is “committed to ensuring that every student—regardless of race, background, language, socioeconomic status, or zip code — has access to a high-quality education and vibrant learning opportunities to succeed.” 
“That means removing barriers, expanding support for English learners, and providing all students with the resources they need to thrive,” Fletcher added. “Our schools must be places where every child feels supported and challenged to reach their full potential. We will continue to work with educators, families, and communities to build an education system that is responsive and relentlessly focused on student success.”
Earlier this month, the U.S. Education Department sent a letter asking states and districts to provide certifications they were complying with the order within 10 days or risk losing federal funding. The department then delayed the deadline to sign its form until after April 24 following an agreement between it and groups suing the federal department over the directive. The National Education Association, a teachers union, and the American Civil Liberties Union are challenging the directive in court. 
Kentucky’s legislature has not outlawed DEI in public schools, although legislation was filed in the 2025 General Assembly to roll back such programs. Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, filed bills that would have prohibited DEI initiatives in Kentucky’s public schools and state and local governments.

(Photo courtesy of Virginia Military Institute)The Virginia Military Institute is once again navigating turbulent waters after the abrupt resignation of board president John Adams — and the installation of a high-profile political donor as his short-term replacement.
Thomas Gottwald, chairman and CEO of NewMarket Corporation, was elected interim president of the VMI Board of Visitors on Wednesday, less than a week after Adams resigned without public explanation. The move was first reported by The Washington Post.
Gottwald, a 1983 graduate of VMI and a longtime supporter of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, was appointed to the board by the governor. Like most of the current board, he is aligned with the administration. Gottwald received 10 of the 13 votes, defeating fellow nominee Damon Williams, a bank officer and co-founder of the nonprofit Youth Sports Inc. 
He will serve the remainder of Adams’ term through the end of June. 
In brief remarks following the vote, Gottwald thanked the board for its support and outlined a short-term focus on budget planning and improved communication with alumni.
“My interest is in serving out John’s term, which ends at the end of June,” Gottwald said. “I do not have an interest in continuing beyond that point, and so my effort will be focused on May and June. At the upcoming board meeting, we can elect a president and vice presidents that will, together with the newly constituted board in July and new superintendent, be in a good position to move us forward.”
Gottwald has been a major donor to Youngkin’s political efforts and to the Spirit of VMI PAC, a group composed of alumni, parents and students that has pushed back against diversity reforms and called on supporters to “reject the woke assault on VMI.”
During the meeting, VMI Superintendent Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins emphasized that the next board president will play a critical role in setting a tone of stability and leadership at a time when public trust in the institution is in flux.
“They’ll have to be focused on how to reinforce and endorse the work that’s being done by the institute and the leaders of the institute to fulfill the mission, to drive towards the vision and uphold the values of the institute,” Wins said.
Wins, who did not recommend any candidates for the position, criticized the board’s recent focus on what he called the “mundane and the trivial” — including debates over The Cadet, a publication backed by cadets and alumni — rather than academic and strategic priorities.
He also noted that several members have walked away from their responsibilities in recent years, leaving the institution in what he described as a vulnerable position.
“Does the next board president have the staying power to deal with the challenges of the institute alongside the superintendent and be fully supportive of the direction,” he asked, “or is the board member if they have an agenda or they see things differently, are they going to walk off the board and leave the hard work to the remaining members of the board and institute officials?”
 The superintendent search

Gottwald’s election as an interim board president comes at a pivotal moment for VMI, as a search committee begins the process of replacing Wins — the first Black leader in the institution’s history — following the board’s controversial vote to end his tenure after four and half years.
On Feb. 28, the board voted 6-10 against renewing Wins’ contract. Then-president Adams had previously expressed appreciation for Wins’ leadership, even after voting with the majority. The board is largely composed of appointees selected by Youngkin.
In the wake of the vote, Wins said his departure stemmed from “bias, emotion, and ideology” rather than objective decision-making. 
The political tensions surrounding Wins’ tenure are tied closely to his efforts to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as Title IX protections. In 2022, he requested $6.1 million in state funding to support these efforts — a move that drew strong backlash from some alumni and conservative groups.
Despite the board’s decision, the search to replace Wins is underway. Last month, the superintendent search committee met to review logistical and legal guidance for the hiring process. The group also worked with the selected executive search firm, Buffkin/Baker, to outline stakeholder surveys, refine the search timeline, and establish priorities for the role.
Details of the search process have been made publicly available on VMI’s superintendent search webpage.
The committee includes seven board members and six advisory members and is co-chaired by C. Ernest Edgar IV and Jamie Inman — who were opposite sides of the vote to renew Wins’ contract. Edgar supported renewing, while Inman opposed.
Inman, who previously served as VMI’s chief of staff and special assistant to former Superintendent Ret. Gen. J.H. Binford Peay III, was appointed to the board by Youngkin in June 2023.

(Photo courtesy of John Seymour)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and 38 other attorneys general want Congress to pass a bill to prohibit pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies, according to a letter Miyares co-signed Monday. 
Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs retain rebates and discounts from contracts, leaving consumers and pharmacies unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. That lack of transparency has raised bipartisan concern among Virginia lawmakers.
In their letter, Miyares and other AGs assert that PBMs’ use of pharmacies owned by themselves or their parent company “has exacerbated the problem of manipulated prices and unavailability of certain prescription medications.”
“PBMs were originally created to streamline prescription drug access and reduce costs for patients, but they’ve become powerful gatekeepers,” Miyares said in a press release announcing he’d signed onto the joint letter. “Virginians and Americans deserve better, and I’m fighting to ensure they get it.” 
In urging congressional action, the attorneys general argue that banning PBMs or their parent companies from pharmacy ownership would “allow pharmacies to compete on fair terms and create a market that is more accessible to consumers.”
Meanwhile, Virginia lawmakers have already worked on ways to reform PBMs at the state level. 
This year, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers passed a bill that would eliminate health-plan-run PBMs in Medicaid and establish a single state-contracted one. This move, supporters say, would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat.
Lawmakers push back on Youngkin budget, pass bipartisan bills on probation, dangerous driving

More than addressing drug costs for patients, some advocates stressed that reform can help support rural healthcare access and small businesses. 
“I know what it’s like to spend $10 to make $5 back from Medicaid,” said Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell, who has owned an independent pharmacy. 
“We’re the first line,” Blacksburg-area pharmacist Jeremy Counts told The Mercury earlier this year. 
He emphasized how local pharmacies serve as key access points for prescriptions, vaccines and physician consultations for rural patients where hospitals are not always nearby. With both national and local pharmacy closures on the rise, Counts warned of “pharmacy deserts” and patient access issues, especially in Southwest Virginia. 
After the bill passed the legislature with bipartisan support, Gov. Glenn Youngkin sought an amendment to study the move rather than charge forward with creating a state-run PBM 
“We do not need more studies,” Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, one of the bill’s patrons, said Wednesday. “This is a true bipartisan bill.” 
When the legislature reconvened earlier this month, the PBM bill was among those whose gubernatorial recommendations were rejected. Now Youngkin has until May 2 to sign the bills into law as they passed, or veto them.

Americans have many big and important differences these days, but if we can’t come together to agree on a handful of fundamental ideals and human rights that have been baked into our Constitution and way of life for over two centuries, we’re in big trouble.
And one of those fundamentals is the simple idea that government cannot suddenly seize and imprison any person — much less deport them to a foreign gulag — without due process and the right to defend themselves in open court.
Tragically, however, the Trump administration has been trashing this fundamental right of late by, quite literally, empowering masked and armed officers to simply seize people on the street and whisk them off to unknown sites.
Such disappearances represent a despicable betrayal of everything our nation supposedly stands for.
The bottom line: Whatever their disagreements on other issues, it’s imperative that all North Carolina elected leaders of both major parties stand up, speak out and demand an immediate end to these outrageous and unconstitutional acts. Our nation’s status as a free country is on the line.

(File photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)More than 100 property owners in Central Maryland have refused to let power company PSEG onto their land to survey for the proposed Piedmont power line project, the company said in a legal filing Tuesday.
In a 53-page filing with the U.S. District Court for Maryland — at least 14 pages of which is a listing of defendants — the New Jersey-based company is seeking an order that would let it access the properties with a minimum of 24 hours notice, and prohibit the property owners from interfering.
In its filing, the company said that despite “numerous real and bona fide efforts” to obtain consent from landowners, each has refused.
“Despite our efforts to engage with property owners and even offer reasonable compensation, we have been unable to gain voluntary access from a sufficient number of property owners that will allow us to conduct these environmental surveys,” PSEG said in an April 9 public statement, which also warned that lawsuits could be coming.
The company said it had offered financial compensation to landowners who allowed temporary access for the “noninvasive environmental surveys.” But it said in the filing that an “organized and funded opposition, led by STOP MPRP, Inc.” has “urged property owners to refuse the Company access.”
The group was convened last year, after community members first learned of the power line project, known as the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project — and grew concerned that the 67-mile power transmission line would destroy tracts of rural land in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties.
The all-volunteer organization is funded entirely by donations and membership payments, said Joanne Frederick, a co-founder and president of the board of directors.
As demand for AI rises, so do power-thirsty data centers

“People have the right to say no when someone wants to come on their land,” Frederick said. “And as an organization, we made people aware of their rights to say no.”
Frederick called Tuesday’s court filing from PSEG “another attack” on local landowners, who were startled to learn of PSEG’s plans for the line, and the possibility that it could use eminent domain to acquire land.
“PSEG wants to come onto peoples’ properties to do surveys, so they can use that information to strengthen their application to then later come and take our land,” Frederick said. “Do we, as landowners, have to make it easier for someone to take our land?”
STOP MPRP said Wednesday evening that it had retained legal counsel “to advise our organization on the best course of action to support our members and affected landowners,” and it urged Gov. Wes Moore (D) to issue a public statement in support of the landowners.
Frederick said distrust for PSEG abounds in the community, and some residents are concerned that the surveys could do damage to their properties — or that the data gathered could be distorted to suit PSEG’s needs.
PSEG is completing the surveying — including forest, wetland and sensitive species assessments — as part of its application before the Maryland Public Service Commission for the power line, filed in December. The commission, which regulates utilities in the state, must issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity before the project can go forward.
Only after PSC approval could the company seek to use eminent domain. In a prior public statement, the company called it an “option of last resort,” adding that it would only be used “to maintain reliable electric infrastructure for all Marylanders.”
The transmission line was commissioned by PJM Interconnection, the electric grid operator serving Maryland and 12 other states, as well as Washington, DC. It would connect a Baltimore Gas & Electric right-of-way in northern Baltimore County to the Doubs Substation in Frederick County.
PJM has said that it commissioned the Piedmont line, along with other transmission projects, to account for increased energy demand, including from power-hungry data centers like the ones in Northern Virginia, and the loss of energy supply thanks to retiring fossil fuel generators.
In its legal filing, PSEG said it is obligated, under an agreement with PJM, to bring the power line into service by June 2027, and to do so, it must begin construction by January 2026.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
If the court does not grant access for the surveying, PSEG would be forced to redraw the power line route, and resubmit its application with the Maryland PSC, the company said. But a different route may not change the outcome, because of the significant community pushback, PSEG said.
“Based on public comments and correspondence the Company has received to date, it is likely that the Company would encounter additional opposition with any alternative proposed line,” reads the lawsuit. “This, in turn, would likely put the Company in exactly the same position in which it finds itself now: seeking Court intervention.”
So far, PSEG has paid nearly $1.6 million to siting and environmental consultants, and $1.3 million to a real estate firm helping contact relevant property owners, according to the company’s lawsuit. Resubmitting an application would likely require the company to incur those fees all over again, and jeopardize the project’s timeline, the suit stated.
Frederick said that PSEG is essentially “asking landowners to either give up and just allow this to happen, or hire what could be very costly attorneys to protect their own land rights,” adding that the impacted property owners include elderly individuals, and some who have never been involved in legal proceedings before.
“We’re standing together. People are resolute. I do not believe that this latest foray will suddenly cause people to just give up,” Frederick said.
Frederick, who lives on a farm property impacted by the route, said she is one of the landowners who was sued earlier this week. If the power line is constructed, she said that she stands to lose about 5 acres of forest on her property, which contains conservation and forest buffer easements.
She purchased the property in 2020. It was a one-time dairy farm, once owned by her great-grandparents, that was sold out of the family in 2004 and fell into disrepair. For the past five years, Frederick said she has been working to restore the farm and her family’s legacy.
But PSEG’s project threatens to upend that, she said. That’s why she has thrown herself into the opposition effort, she said.
“It has been all-consuming,” Frederick said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20240829_125307-2048x921-1-e1735746730455-1024x584.jpg,,,2025-04-17 06:00:10.150798

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/17/board-of-nursing-has-cleared-hundreds-of-cases-of-questionable-documentation-for-nurses/,The Maryland Board of Nursing said it has cleared almost all of the 259 nurses and nursing applicants who may have obtained a Maryland license using fraudulent documents from a scheme revealed in Florida more than two years ago.,"(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)The Maryland Board of Nursing said it has cleared almost all of the 259 nurses and nursing applicants who may have obtained a Maryland license using fraudulent documents from a scheme revealed in Florida more than two years ago.
The board said that it found “no cause to take disciplinary action” against 205 of the Maryland cases linked to “Operation Nightingale,” a multistate investigation by federal official in 2023 of a Florida-based wire fraud scheme that provided bogus documentation of nursing credentials.
The board did revoke the “privilege to practice in Maryland” for three nurses and voted to issue charges against seven others, who were referred to the Office of the Attorney General for prosecution. Three nurses voluntarily surrendered their licenses, another 12 applicants withdrew their applications for a registered nurse license in Maryland and the board voted to dispose of another three without taking action.
Those numbers were included in the board’s response to an Office of Legislative Audits report released last week that was a followup to a 2024 inquiry into several boards and commissions that oversee health care facilities or practitioners.
Among the findings of the report, which covered the period from September 2019 to July 2023, was that the agencies often failed to investigate complaints against licensees in a timely manner — a problem the auditors said could be due to staffing shortages during that period.
The report said that the 20 boards and commissions it studied had a total of 4,916 open cases as of February 2024, but that 3,051 of those had been open more than two years. The Board of Nursing, the largest by far of all the boards, had 2,411 cases that had been open more than two years, it said.

The auditors also reported in February 2024 that the nursing board could not provide documentation that it had investigated any of the 259 nurses whose names came up as part of Operation Nightingale — a claim the board disputed at the time, and again last week.
The board now says it is missing documentation for just 26 of those 259. While that is a significant improvement, the OLA report adds on to other audits that raise concerns in oversight and documentation of Board of Nursing and the Department of Health over several years.
The Operation Nightingale investigation became public in a January 2023 post from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. It said its investigation, along with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, uncovered three Florida nursing schools tied to “bogus” nursing degree diplomas and transcripts that were sold to “aspiring” Registered Nurses (RN) and Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurse (LPN/VN) to qualify for the national nursing board exam.
“Upon successful completion of the board exam, the nursing applicants became eligible to obtain licensure in various states,” the HHS statement said. “Once licensed, the individuals were then able to obtain employment in the health care field. The overall scheme involved the distribution of more than 7,600 fake nursing diplomas and transcripts. These schools are now closed.”
Former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Markenzy Lapointe said at the time that the wire fraud scheme “erodes public trust in our health care system.”
“Not only is this a public safety concern, it also tarnishes the reputation of nurses who actually complete the demanding clinical and course work required to obtain their professional licenses and employment,” Lapointe said in the 2023 statement.
The Maryland Board of Nursing was notified of 287 nurses or nursing applicants who may have received licensure with false credentials, with the expectation that the Maryland board would look into those cases. By February 2024, the board said it had reviewed most of those cases, even though the OLA said it lacked documentation at the time for that claim. At that time, 131 of those nurses had been working within the Maryland health system, the OLA said.
The Board of Nursing agreed that the audit’s findings were factual and has since located much of the missing documentation regarding those 259 nursing licenses — though documentation for 26 cases are still missing.
“Board of Nursing has located a substantial amount of the records documenting the work conducted to screen and process the 259 individuals who may have obtained licensure in Maryland using fraudulent credentials,” the board responded in the April audit report.
The board believes that it will resolve the outstanding 26 cases by July. The Board of Nursing has a list of the actions it has taken related to nursing licenses involved in Operation Nightingale.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed became the second Democrat to enter the race for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat on Thursday.
El-Sayed, who ran for governor in 2018, joins state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) in seeking the seat after incumbent U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) announced that he would not seek re-election.
Other potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit). Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) have also been mentioned as possible Democratic candidates.
El-Sayed said in an interview with the Michigan Advance that he chose to run because “it’s way too hard to get by in Michigan right now, and in the richest, most powerful country in the world, folks shouldn’t have to struggle so hard to afford basic things.”
He said he thinks about the effect rising costs are having on everyday people he met during his 2018 campaign.
“You can just see it grinding them down in ways that shouldn’t have to happen,” El-Sayed said. “I look at what Trump and Musk are doing, and frankly, they’re just making it so much worse. We’ve got to step up and we’ve got to fight back, and I think that happens best in the seat in the U.S. Senate.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After suffering defeat to President Donald Trump in the last election, El-Sayed says Democrats must “speak plainly about issues of direct relevance to people’s lives in ways that are easy to understand and to embrace, and we have to run on public policy that has direct impact on people’s lives as immediately as possible.”
“I think sometimes when it comes to the way that we run, we try to tact or triangulate to the least common denominator of what we think everybody can be okay with, and I think that makes us seem inauthentic, and it leaves us sounding like we don’t really have anything to say at all,” El-Sayed said.
He said it’s not enough to simply fight against the Trump administration, arguing that Democrats must also articulate a positive, forward-looking message about what they plan to do.
He pointed to universal health coverage, environmental regulations, affordable housing and reigning in corporations and the ultrawealthy as priorities.
“I feel really well placed in a race like this, because I have the opportunity both to be that fighter who stands up to Donald Trump and Elon Musk and all their acolytes, but also to have the skills to be able to build after they’re gone,” El-Sayed said. “And I think there’s going to be a lot of wreckage that they leave in their wake.”
El-Sayed pointed to his time as the director of the Detroit Health Department from 2015 to 2017 as evidence that he is “able to build in the circumstances of wreckage that politicians leave behind.”
But while El-Sayed critiqued Democrats’ messaging, he is taking a different approach than his former boss, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is running for governor as an independent and has said that the Democratic and Republican parties have a “death grip” on Michigan politics.
“When parties aren’t delivering for folks, the question isn’t to run outside the party, it’s to have the courage to rethink what your party ought to be doing,” El-Sayed said. “I’ve had my fair share of disagreements with the Democratic Party on a number of issues, and what I’m trying to do about it is to demonstrate the capacity to win elections by campaigning on the issues that I believe in.”
While El-Sayed said there is a short-term urgency to fighting back against the Trump administration, he added that Democrats must also address what he described as a broken political system that allowed Trump to be elected in the first place.
“If you’re unable to address the circumstances that Donald Trump exploited to get elected in 2016 in the first place, then I worry that all you’re doing is kind of your own version of Make America Great Again; it’s just 2015 instead of somewhere in the 1930s, where Donald Trump seems to want to be dragging us,” El-Sayed said.
But many of those policy goals would be difficult to get through the Senate if the filibuster remains in place, El-Sayed said, arguing that it “has served to interfere with more progressive legislation and, frankly, interfere with our ability to deliver on what we say it is that we want to do which has redounded to the benefit of Republicans.”
“Remember, at the end of the day, their governing philosophy is that government is part of the problem, ours is that government is part of the solution,” El-Sayed said. “So anything that stops the government from working inevitably redounds to their benefit.”
El-Sayed said the filibuster is “anti-democratic on its own terms.”
“The idea that one U.S. senator can block legislation for the entire country, it does not comport with the ideals of democracy,” El-Sayed said. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was widely criticized for breaking a Democratic filibuster to advance a Republican-backed stopgap funding bill earlier this year. El-Sayed declined to commit to supporting any specific candidate to be the Democratic leader if elected, saying he would have to see who seeks the role before making any decisions.
“Anybody who tells you that they’re going to support one person or another without knowing who the alternative is, is just either unsophisticated or unnuanced about the choice in front of you,” El-Sayed said.
McMorrow has indicated that she would not support Schumer to continue as Democratic leader.
Michigan’s soon-to-be senior U.S. senator, Elissa Slotkin, made similar waves in her 2018 campaign for the U.S. House, when she vowed to withhold support from Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker.
El-Sayed said he would find common ground with Slotkin on issues like workers’ rights and environmental protections while “leading on those issues that my background and my experience give me particular expertise on,” like health care.
“She and I are very different people, but what better representation in the state of Michigan than a Jewish woman and a Muslim man,” El-Sayed said.
El-Sayed said he made the decision to run for the U.S. Senate rather than making a second attempt at becoming governor in part after he watched federal funding that the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services get caught in a federal funding freeze.
“I’ve asked myself, where is the fight now? 43% of the state’s budget is federal funds, and I think it’s going to be really difficult for anybody leading our state if Trump and Musk continue to do what they are doing and decimate a lot of the funding that the state relies on,” El-Sayed said. “And so, to me, I think the locus of the fight has to be at the Senate.”
El-Sayed appeared last month at a rally with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Warren that drew more than 10,000 people, filling three overflow rooms with an additional crowd gathered outside.

He said the level of enthusiasm “demonstrates a real hunger for a politics that is direct, that is unapologetic and that is consistent with the needs and frustrations that people have in this moment.”
“That, for me, was a really, really important testing point for the argument that we are making here, which is that if we are serious about winning elections in the future, then Democrats have to be serious about being honest, direct and clear about what we fight for, not just what we fight against,” El-Sayed said.
That also extends to the primary, El-Sayed said, saying that one of the mistakes of his 2018 campaign – which ultimately ended with now-Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sweeping all 83 counties – was being too focused on the other candidates in the primary.
“Sometimes we missed the opportunity to just demonstrate – to show people, not tell them – why I’d be the best candidate for them and for the future,” El-Sayed said.
But while that campaign ended nearly seven years ago, he said he’s not concerned about recapturing momentum and standing out in a potentially crowded primary field.
“If there’s any upside, politically, to having a name like mine, it’s that it’s not one that people soon forget,” El-Sayed said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.

“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

Pharmacy middlemen working in Ohio on behalf of huge health conglomerates have long claimed they keep down drug costs. But a report released last week calls that into question.
The Ohio Department of Medicaid had been burned in the past by the big middlemen. And pharmacies across the state for years had said their Medicaid reimbursements were so scant that it was hard to stay in business. So the Medicaid department in 2022 gave the big pharmacy benefit managers — or PBMs — the boot and created a new system of paying for drugs.
The result: Dispensing fees paid to pharmacies were boosted more than 1,200% on average — and the new setup still achieved savings of $140 million over a two-year period, according to a study done by Milliman, the Medicaid department’s actuarial firm. 
At the same time, the system managed to sign up nearly every pharmacy in the state, the report said. That makes medicine more accessible to Medicaid patients, who often lack access to reliable transportation.
“Bottom Line: The (new system) delivers on its goals of accountability, transparency, and fairness – While doing so at a significantly lower administrative overhead cost to taxpayers,” the Medicaid department said in a cover letter to lawmakers that accompanies the study.
The three biggest PBMs in the United States are each owned by one of the 15 largest companies — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts. The conglomerates own major insurers and myriad other health businesses, such as doctors’ offices and pharmacies.
Their pharmacy benefit managers work on behalf of those and competing insurers to facilitate drug transactions that run through their own and competing pharmacies. They decide which drugs are covered by insurance and which get preferential treatment.
Combined, the big-three PBMs control nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United States. That gives them great leverage to negotiate huge rebates and fees from drugmakers and to impose opaque contracts on pharmacies.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The big PBMs have long claimed they use their size to squeeze savings from drugmakers and pharmacies that they pass along to the insurers they represent. The conglomerates that own them also say that strict firewalls stand between their business units to keep their middlemen from providing unfair advantages to insurers and pharmacies owned by the same corporation.
But there are widespread complaints that the PBMs’ dealings are far from transparent, making it impossible for outsiders to know whether they’re getting a good deal. In 2018, the Ohio Department of Medicaid learned that it wasn’t.
Independent and small-chain pharmacies across Ohio had been complaining that they were getting killed in the Medicaid program. The reimbursements and dispensing fees they got from CVS Caremark and OptumRx were so low that it was making it hard for them to stay in business, they said.
The Columbus Dispatch in 2018 undertook an investigation. It gathered confidential reimbursement data from dozens of pharmacies, compared them to Medicaid claims data and determined that the two PBMs were charging the state a lot more for drugs than they were paying the pharmacies that had bought and dispensed them.
That prompted the Department of Medicaid to get the PBMs to turn over all their data. It commissioned a study showing that in 2017 alone, the two PBMs servicing the program charged taxpayers $224 million more for drugs than they paid out to pharmacists.
Those and other revelations prompted Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to file several lawsuits against the PBMs on behalf of state agencies. In addition, state lawmakers in Ohio and elsewhere have passed a raft of laws aimed at reigning them in, and the Federal Trade Commission is investigating and suing the companies.
For its part, the Ohio Department of Medicaid fired CVS Caremark and OptumRx and devised its own PBM. 
Launched in October 2022, it unbundled the services that had been provided by the big PBMs to create transparency and ensure contractors weren’t imposing huge markups as they had in 2017. 
In the interest of keeping pharmacies whole, it also mandated a huge increase on dispensing fees paid to them — from an average of just 73 cents per prescription under the old system to $9 under the new one, the report said. Partly as a result of that, the Medicaid department was able to get almost every pharmacy in Ohio to join its network and thus maximize accessibility for recipients.
The single PBM “pharmacy network is the largest, most inclusive in-state pharmacy network ever, with over 99% of Ohio pharmacies contracted as in-network providers, the Medicaid department said. “In addition to standard retail pharmacies, Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries also have access to specialized compounding pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies, home delivery pharmacies, and specialty pharmacies. In total, over 2,600 unique pharmacy locations are contracted with (the single PBM), including nearly 250 accredited specialty pharmacies.” 
The Medicaid department also boasted that recipients enjoy “complete freedom of choice with respect to their pharmacy selection” because Gainwell, the company that runs its PBM, doesn’t own a pharmacy.  
Ohio attorney general and 38 others call on Congress to stop middlemen from owning pharmacies

CVS Caremark and OptumRx are part of giant health conglomerates that also own pharmacies. Yost and 38 other state attorneys general on Monday accused the conglomerates of using their middlemen to favor their own pharmacies over their competitors. In a letter, they called on Congress to prohibit the health care giants from owning both PBMs and pharmacies.
The Medicaid department said it avoided such conflicts under its new arrangement.
“Under the (former arrangement), members were often steered to PBM-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacies; today, members are provided their options and are free to select the pharmacy provider that best meets their needs,” the department said. 
In addition, the new, single PBM eliminated duplicative administrative costs. That measure saved $333 million over two years when compared to what they would have cost under the old system, according to models created by the Medicaid department’s actuaries.
If you deduct increased dispensing fees and other new expenses from those savings, the new system created net savings of $140 million over a two-year period, the actuaries said.
The new system “has delivered much needed accountability and price transparency for Ohio taxpayers and Ohio pharmacies, providing assurance that Ohio’s tax dollars are spent appropriately,” the Medicaid department said.

(Photo by Benjamin Rondel/Getty Images)The New Hampshire Senate has often trashed landfill bills. But with growing political attention to solid waste issues, including from the governor, advocates hope this year will be different.
An early test came Tuesday, when the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee heard one bill to pause new landfills in the state for three years and another that seeks to rewrite recently updated regulations that some say are far too weak. 
The bills — House Bill 171 and House Bill 707, respectively — complement one another in ways. Advocates say the state should need only one new landfill in the next century. They argue taking a pause on new development will allow the state time to consider issues like the ones raised in HB 707 related to siting landfills, as well as others like managing the “trash juice” several landfills have failed to handle properly, or addressing the fact that half the waste dumped in New Hampshire comes from out of state.
Both bills proved uncontroversial in the House, passing on the consent calendar, where lawmakers approve a host of committee recommendations on legislation all at once and without debate. Solid waste issues in the state have garnered bipartisan support, with bills being led by both Republicans and Democrats. 
“Landfills should be the last resort, and we only really need one in the next 100 years,” Rep. Kelley Potenza, a Rochester Republican leading HB 707, told committee members. “And let’s do it in a perfect place that’s got good soil, clay, and we can make it happen.”
In the backdrop of the legislative debates is a proposal for a new landfill that many — including Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte — have criticized for its close proximity to a pristine lake and state park. Casella Waste Systems, the Vermont company that has fought for years for the landfill in the northern town of Dalton, is now fighting the Department of Environmental Services in court over the agency’s recent denial of a solid waste permit application for the project. 
HB 707 seeks to address criticisms against the state’s updated landfill regulations, which went into effect in December. The body that gave the final green light to those changes, the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, had approved them even as some members were concerned they weren’t adequately protective. Lawmakers on the panel argued, though, that those issues were policy ones for the Legislature to decide. This bill aims to take up that mantle.
For one, it would establish stricter setback standards for new landfills from “any existing drinking water well, perennial river, lake, or coastal water of New Hampshire.” Landfills would have to be 1,500 feet from those waters or be set back far enough so that groundwater from the site would take more than five years to reach those waters in the event of a leak or failure. Whichever of those two setbacks is the greatest would be what is required of the site. 
Additionally, it would strengthen the state’s requirements for the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at the site of a landfill, a metric that helps describe how quickly contaminated water would move through the soil in the event of a leak or failure. Some types of earth, like sand or gravel, are more permeable than others, like clay.
This standard — which would require a hydraulic conductivity of 0.0001 centimeters per second or less — would apply to the natural soils 20 feet below the landfill and under leachate storage and transfer stations. The current standard is 0.001 centimeters per second or less for the natural soil of the landfill going down 5 feet in depth. (The lower the rate, the slower pollution would move through the soil.)
Or, in what critics have called a “loophole” in the current regulations, a landfill can import a 2-foot base of soil with a hydraulic conductivity of 0.0001 centimeters per second or less. The bill would eliminate that option, stating explicitly that “no amount of imported soil can overcome such deficiency” in the hydraulic conductivity of a site’s natural soil.
The bill would also require that applicants for new landfills and expansions to investigate the sediments and bedrock beneath and adjacent to the proposed site, “at least to the depth of any aquifers currently used to provide drinking water to residents.” 
Under the bill, landfills would be required to always have at least one person on site. It also directs the department to incorporate the Ford Act into its landfill permitting requirements, “specifically the provision limiting the construction or establishment of municipal solid waste landfills within 6 miles of certain smaller public airports.” 
Current law says the department “may” deny a permit if a person “fails to demonstrate sufficient reliability, expertise, integrity, and competence to operate a solid waste facility.” It may also deny a permit if a person or a company’s “officers, directors, partners, key employees or persons or business entities holding 10 percent or more of its equity or debt liability” were convicted or pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony within the past five years in state or federal court.
This bill would change that “may” to a “shall,” making it a requirement that the department reject permits under those conditions instead of an option.
The legislation would also make what advocates say is a key change to the statute governing the department’s rulemaking. Instead of simply saying the commissioner has the responsibility and authority to adopt rules, it adds that those rules “are necessary to protect the public health and the environment with an ample margin of safety relative to this chapter.”
Some lawmakers on the panel, as well as a representative of Waste Management, which intends to expand its Turnkey facility in Rochester, indicated they would like more clarity in the language of the bill about how broad its exemption for expanding landfills is.
Henry Veilleux, a lobbyist for Waste Management, said the standard for the 20 feet of undisturbed soil beneath the landfill “would be problematic” and could create issues for the landfill starting in 2028. If the bill was changed so the landfill was allowed to bring in other material to be compliant, “then it would be OK,” he said. 
He also raised issues with part of the bill that would strengthen existing references to storm events in permitting requirements to apply to 100-year storms “with a 50% margin of safety,” arguing the department’s current model makes more sense for the region.
Though he raised concerns about these provisions, Veilleux also told the committee members he had just spoken to Potenza, and that the bill did not intend to impact the Turnkey facility. 
Shaun Mulholland, Lebanon’s city planner, said he was concerned that parts of the bill would affect the city’s plans to excavate its unlined landfill “that is leaking into the ground” into a lined one. He said Waste Management had identified a number of those concerns, but also added that he felt it would be challenging for the city to find staff for a guard onsite 24/7, considering it already has “great difficulty in this labor market in hiring people just to work in the daytime at the landfill.” He suggested technology like sensors would be more appropriate and effective.
Michael Wimsatt, director of DES’ waste management division, defended the department’s rules at the hearing. He said those rules include a site-specific setback requirement, but critics reject that characterization. 
Wimsatt pointed to language that says landfills and associated infrastructure “shall be located only in areas where groundwater monitoring for release detection, characterization and remediation can be conducted prior to a release having an adverse impact on groundwater quality at the property line” and before it has “an adverse impact on a water supply.” It also requires the landfills are located so that releases “will be detected and assessed, and remediation initiated prior to contamination reaching any perennial water body.”
Current regulations also require more general setbacks of 200 feet from certain streams and 500 feet from other water bodies. 
Wayne Morrison, president of the North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, a citizen group that has advocated for more protective waste policies, called the provision Wimsatt cited “a motherhood statement.”
“We think it lacks the heat behind it,” he said. 
On DES’ argument that its current regulations are site specific, Potenza was blunt: “They aren’t.”
“That doesn’t give anyone any instruction,” Potenza said of the provisions, “and to be honest … it puts the state in a very precarious position, I believe, for lawsuits and everything like that, because it doesn’t have anything, literally, specific.”
Under the state’s regulations, “you can put a landfill anywhere in the state of New Hampshire right now, as long as you bring in some soil,” Potenza said. “Doesn’t matter what that … site is, as long as you’re 500 feet back.” She called the state’s rules the weakest in the world; when asked by a lawmaker if that was the case, Wimsatt said, “I don’t believe that for a moment.”
The conversation on landfill siting underscored the push for a pause on new landfills in the state. And it’s not just the direct neighbors of landfills who are affected, Morrison said.
“What I have found is it’s in everybody’s backyard,” he said. “New Hampshire’s a small state. If you mess up a water table, it doesn’t just affect Dalton, it affects all the surrounding towns.” 
He said the state has ample landfill capacity to buy it time to carefully consider how it wants to move forward with its solid waste management. 
“We have the time, and … I think we have the obligation to future generations of people in New Hampshire to step back, do the investigations, find best practices, think differently about what we’re doing,” Morrison said. “We have to live with these decisions for the next 100 years, and we have the time to fix them. Let’s try and get it right.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/landfillsenate-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.



To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-17 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT students’ visas revoked: As details emerge, fears escalate",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-student-visas-revoked-details/,"Most students’ status terminations appear to be connected to a wide range of interactions with law enforcement, rather than campus protests.","Normally at this time of year, students at Connecticut colleges and universities are caught up in the stress of researching final papers and preparing for exams.
But in recent days, thousands of international students — who have come from far and wide to pursue degrees from the state’s renowned higher education institutions — have been consumed with fear of losing their permission to study in the United States.
Earlier this week, the University of Connecticut confirmed that 13 students — six undergrads, six graduate students and one person in a post-graduate professional program — had seen their visa status terminated by federal authorities. None had been given a reason why, a spokesperson for UConn said.
The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, which represents 14 independent schools including Yale University, Trinity College, Quinnipiac University and Wesleyan University, said visas had been terminated for more than 40 students at its member institutions.
Initially, when reports began to emerge late last month of student visa cancellations and legal status terminations at schools around the country, the effort appeared to be focused on students who had protested or voiced opinions in favor of Palestine or against the war in Gaza. President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order in January to “combat anti-semitism,” and the administration has stated its intent to “quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” 
That no longer appears to be the only criteria.
CCIC President Jennifer Widness and lawyers who spoke to The Connecticut Mirror said the majority of the students whose statuses were being terminated were not involved in campus protests. Instead, the terminations appear to be connected to a wide range of interactions with law enforcement — many of which may not be deportable offenses, the lawyers said.
“This has been very painful on the students,” Dana Bucin, an immigration attorney and partner at the law firm Harris Beach Murtha, said. In recent days, Bucin said, she’s been contacted by about a dozen students, some from inside Connecticut and some from other states, all of whom have had their immigration status revoked.
“I can tell you this: Instead of focusing on finals and dissertations and graduations, now they have to figure out how to protect themselves from sudden arrest,” Bucin said. 
On the evening of April 8, a graduate student at UConn received a message in his inbox from the university’s office of International Student & Scholar Services, informing him that his immigration status had been terminated. 
The student, who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns for his immigration status, said he knew it was coming.
The student told the CT Mirror that he had been arrested once. In 2024, he’d had what he described as a “minor argument” with his ex-girlfriend while on the street, he said. It became physical, and a bystander called the police. He was arrested on a family violence charge, but the court referred him to counseling and the case was dismissed within a few months, according to both him and his lawyer. Court records confirm the case was dropped. 
The student — who was expecting to graduate in the fall of 2026 — said he knows of other students at UConn whose visas had been revoked. He said he’d formed a group on social media that included hundreds of students nationwide.
“ People are feeling panic. And some of them have already got their visas terminated, and some of them have the arrest records, and they are expecting that day to come,” he said. 
Chris Llinas, a criminal defense and immigration attorney in Connecticut, said a person’s visa status can be terminated only if that person is convicted of certain types of crime and sentenced to a year or more of prison time. 
“I’ve been in touch with many of the affected Connecticut students, and none of them have that,” Llinas said.
Llinas said he’s spoken to students who are in diversionary programs, who have had their cases dismissed after participating in diversionary programs (alternatives to prosecution and incarceration) or court supervision, and one who was found not guilty of a crime. 
Bucin said she’s spoken to students whose closest brush with a crime was a traffic violation.   
“ It sounds like it’s simply if there’s been any interaction with law enforcement whatsoever, even for a small traffic ticket, these people are being targeted for status revocation,” she said.
Most international students affiliated with Connecticut primary, secondary and higher education schools in March 2025 had come from India, China, Canada, South Korea and Nigeria. Indian students made up 33.41% of the total, with 5,934 students, followed by 4,468 students from China, 25.16%. Students from Canada were 4.14% of the total, while South Korea and Nigeria made 2.84% and 1.75% of the total, respectively.Connecticut has a total of 17,760 international students with F and M visas. F visas are for full-time students at academic institutions. M visas are for students in vocational programs.
Bucin described three avenues students could take if they’ve had their immigration status terminated. First, she said, they can appeal to have their F-1 visa reinstated, which they need to do within five months of termination.
Bucin noted that a student would have to apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is housed under the Department of Homeland Security — the same agency that terminated the student’s status. “It’s as if your judge is your prosecutor,” she said.  
Another avenue is to self-deport, since once a person’s status is revoked, they can legally be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and deported at any time. But Bucin said she didn’t like that option. 
“ I hold the legal opinion that these F-1 status revocations have been done illegally. So for you to voluntarily give up your tuition payments and your course of study and everything you’ve built here in this country, and just voluntarily depart … it just goes counter to my sense of justice,” she said. 
The third way, she said, is to file a lawsuit, either as an individual or a class action, in federal court.
Earlier this week, the law firm Kuck Baxter filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Northern Georgia against top officials in the Trump administration. The firm is now representing 150 students who have had their immigration status terminated.
On March 25, the American Association of University Professors filed a lawsuit against members of the Trump administration, in which they allege that the policy of deporting international students who have participated in protests supporting Palestine to be a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments.
One of the plaintiffs in the AAUP lawsuit is Aslı Bâli, a Yale Law School professor and president of the nonprofit Middle East Studies Association. The lawsuit claimed Bâli’s work is being disrupted by the policy and that she had received “a cascade of requests for advice and assistance from noncitizen students and colleagues who fear that they will be targeted for deportation based on their speech.” 
“Many of these individuals have deleted their social media profiles, removed online references to their involvement in campus groups that have supported Palestinian rights, and taken down previously public writing about Palestine,” the lawsuit read. “One noncitizen colleague is considering declining an offer to chair their department out of concern that they might be limited in what they could say or do in the role without making themselves a target for deportation.” 
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has written to DHS and the State Department seeking more information about the visa revocations, according to a press advisory sent late Wednesday. Blumenthal and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker are expected to provide more information on the letter at an event Thursday morning in New Haven.
Later in the day Thursday, AAUP is holding protests against the federal government’s actions toward universities at Yale University and UConn’s Storrs campus. 
Llinas said attorneys are still trying to decide the best course of action to address the status revocations. 
“There are good lawyers who care deeply about this, who are working hard to figure out the best possible way to approach this, to serve the F-1 student visa holders across the state who have been affected by this,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_UConn_campus_2015-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

(Submitted by Christine Persun)Lily stared at me with wide, worried eyes, trying to process every word I said as I explained the problem in her workbook. I slowed down and repeated myself. She hung on every word, desperate to keep up.
Lily had immigrated from China just two years earlier and had spent time traveling back and forth. She was an incredibly hard worker, still learning English, and, as a first-year teacher, I had no idea how to help her.
Five years later, Eugenio arrived in my classroom from El Salvador. In many ways, he reminded me of Lily—motivated, hardworking, and eager to please. But unlike Lily, he had just arrived in the country and didn’t speak a word of English.
This time, though, I was prepared. I gave him directions in my very limited Spanish. I used AI to generate translated notes and assignments. I created a Spanish-to-English math dictionary and kept it handy for him. I modified assignments that would help him learn the concepts and experience success. I was ready to do whatever it took to help him learn.
The difference? Experience.
By the time I had Eugenio in my class, I knew my curriculum and I knew how to meet individual student needs. I knew where to look to find resources. I knew which colleagues to go to for guidance and support. When I had Lily as a student, I was a brand-new teacher, fresh out of student teaching. I had completed my university’s teacher preparation program and learned from a supportive mentor, but I was unprepared for the realities of the classroom. I needed a preparation program that equipped me to help students like Lily and Eugenio from day one—not five years later.
Teacher preparation programs at the university level often train pre-service teachers through a theoretical lens rather than a practical one, leaving many feeling underprepared for the realities of the classroom. In Pennsylvania, these programs vary greatly in coursework requirements, meaning a teacher’s readiness depends as much on their training program as on their own abilities.

A publication from the William Penn Foundation found that in order for teachers to succeed, they require much more time and practice in the classroom than current pathways to teaching offer. What future educators need are training experiences that truly mirror the realities of the classroom.
This means rethinking how we prepare teachers. Education majors should begin their work in schools in the early years of university rather than postponing until their student teaching experience during their senior year, when they may realize that teaching is not for them. From early on in their bachelor’s programs, pre-service teachers should be learning hands-on in the classroom.
Integrating early and consistent field experiences into teacher preparation programs is essential. As noted by Carolyn Parker, director of graduate teacher education at American University’s School of Education, “Get them into the schools as early as you can and as often as you can.” This approach gives pre-service teachers the time they need to build meaningful relationships with students and communities, ensuring they are well-prepared for the realities of the classroom.
They should be completing experiences by observing classrooms and meeting with students. Coursework should center on realistic case studies with real students instead of abstract theories. While standardized tests like the Praxis have been shown to correlate with effective teaching in specific subjects—particularly those requiring deep content knowledge, such as elementary math and reading—clinical experiences and capstone portfolios offer a more comprehensive way for teacher candidates to demonstrate their effectiveness.
More realistic forms of assessment allow candidates to showcase their teaching abilities in real classroom settings, which provides a clearer picture of their preparedness for the challenges of teaching.
Structural changes in teacher preparation policies are also necessary. New teachers consistently cite student teaching as the most valuable part of their training, as it allows them to apply theory in real classrooms under the guidance of experienced mentors.
To maximize its impact, student teaching should last an entire year, not just one semester to ensure that teacher candidates will be able to manage classrooms effectively. Universities must move away from the traditional model which delays classroom experience until later in academic programs. Instead, education majors should begin experiencing classrooms immediately.
Further, licensure requirements should be revised to prioritize demonstrated teaching skills over standardized test scores, allowing for a more accurate assessment of a candidate’s ability to succeed in the classroom.
A stronger, more practical approach to teacher preparation would mean fewer new teachers struggling to support students like Lily – and more teachers entering the classroom equipped to provide students like Eugenio the help they need from day one.
If we want new teachers to succeed, we need to demand change in how they’re prepared. It’s time to prioritize hands-on experience over outdated theory—because when teachers are prepared, students thrive, and when students succeed, we all succeed.

(Getty Images)Each year, a number of bills aim to legislate medicine. These are attempts by lawmakers to regulate the treatment relationship between physicians and their patients, or to determine when treatments can and cannot be delivered. This is nothing new, but a concerning trend has emerged recently in New Hampshire: Some bills go beyond an attempt to legislate medicine by including provisions that also criminalize medicine. 
These tactics include language within bills that impose criminal or civil penalties for physicians who do not comply with specific mandates. This year, House Bill 10, House Bill 232, and House Bill 377 each include provisions that would impose penalties on physicians. 
While health care and the practice of medicine is not — and should not be — political, tactics that seek to criminalize medical care and aspects of the physician-patient relationship stem from shifting political headwinds. Criminalizing medicine distracts and shifts the focus away from the real issues. Facets of medical practice that are seen as hot-button issues are likely to garner debates, both scientific and ideological. Legislating and criminalizing medicine, though, will have a ripple effect that might be felt throughout the health care community in numerous ways. 
Criminalizing medicine is an irresponsible and inappropriate way to control and respond to these issues. 
As physicians, we dedicate our lives and our careers to our patients, typically spending over a decade in training. This includes four years of undergraduate education, four years of medical school, three to eight years of residency training (depending on the medical specialty), and potentially one to three years of subspecialty fellowship training. This training provides us with the medical knowledge necessary to treat the unique health care challenges of each of our patients. Legislating and criminalizing medicine in New Hampshire, however, would mean that our physicians would be practicing medicine with one hand tied behind their back. This would then increase the likelihood that a patient’s health care needs might not be adequately addressed. 
Such bills, even when well-meaning, offer a reductive and punitive approach to health care. Treating the health care needs of vulnerable populations requires physicians to combine evidence-based principals, experience, training, and patient preferences to provide individualized medical care for each of our patients. Health care decisions are not made in a vacuum, and bills that criminalize medicine compromise our ability to make these vital treatment decisions.
Bills that criminalize medical care could set a dangerous precedent and have a “chilling effect,” creating barriers to providing high quality medical care for New Hampshire’s physicians. In other states that have criminalized elements of medical practice, physicians may hesitate to provide care in emergencies due to fear of criminal penalties. This has led to patient deaths that otherwise may have been avoidable. As medical professionals, we need to be entrusted to provide the right care at the right time for patients who need it. 
While Granite Staters already are finding medical care to be hard to come by, criminalizing medicine would make it more difficult to attract and retain physicians and other medical professionals to New Hampshire. This would in turn make it more difficult for patients to get appointments for primary care and specialist care. Bills that remove physician autonomy to care for our patients and penalize them for using their skills and training will have the unintended consequence of pushing physicians out of the state and exacerbating our shortage of physicians — especially in the most rural areas of the state.
Criminalizing the practice of medicine would not just fail our state’s physicians, but it would also fail all of our patients. This would set a dangerous precedent in New Hampshire and put the government in the middle of the relationship between physicians and their patients.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mergerdartmouth-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-17 05:03:42.763763

The Ohio House’s version of the two-year state budget only acknowledge two sexes, male and female, excluding transgender people and intersex people born with a mix of chromosomes or just one chromosome.
“It is the policy of the state of Ohio to recognize two sexes, male and female,” according to language from the House budget. “These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”
The budget passed last week with a 60-39 vote and it now moves to the Ohio Senate. Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine must sign a budget by June 30. He has line-item veto power, so he can remove the gender limitation.

Adding the language to the budget is reckless, said Equality Ohio Executive Director Dwayne Steward. 
“The budget is not the place where we should be discussing culture war or legislating against people’s rights,” Steward said. “Instead of focusing on what’s important, like funding our schools and making sure kids have access to quality healthcare, they have decided a small percentage of the population should be attacked.”
The language in the House budget is similar to President Donald Trump’s executive order earlier this year saying the U.S. government will only recognize two sexes. 
“These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” it says. “Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”
Ohio’s legislators are trying to be in lockstep with the Trump administration, Steward said. 
“It’s almost verbatim from the executive order,” said Dara Adkison, executive director of TransOhio. “We know that there is an intentional effort to make it very difficult for trans people to exist in public spaces.”
The language in the House budget disregards intersex people who are born with variations in their sex characteristics that do not fit the typical binary definitions of male or female. 
“People who are intersex have genitals, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don’t fit into a male/female sex binary,” explains the Cleveland Clinic. “People who are intersex may have a mix of chromosomes, such as XXY. Or they may have some cells that are XY and some cells that are XX. Or they may have just one X chromosome (XO).”
It is estimated that up to 1.7% of the population has an intersex trait, according to the Center for American Progress. 
“The invalidation of all of those Ohioans as part of the budget is ridiculous,” Adkison said. 
The intersex community deserves to be recognized, Steward said. 
“They do exist,” he said. “You can’t legislate people out of existence.” 
Half of all transgender and nonbinary young people in Ohio who participated in a recent Trevor Project survey said they seriously considered suicide in the past year. Fifteen percent said they attempted suicide. 
This is according to the Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People. The survey included about 700 people from Ohio, ages 13-24. 
Nearly three-fourths of transgender and nonbinary young people in Ohio reported feeling anxiety and 61% experienced depression, according to the survey. 
About 60% of transgender and nonbinary young people or their families have considered leaving Ohio because of anti-LGBTQ politics and law, according to the survey.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Every year, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost releases a report detailing the state of Ohio’s capital punishment system. This year, as with last year, it depicts an expensive and inefficient program. Yost argues serious reform is needed to drag it out of the ditch, but opponents contend the attorney general is misreading the facts in front of him.
They argue it’s time to scrap the death penalty in Ohio, not grasp for an end-run to restart executions.
Yost’s perspective
In the 2024 Capital Crimes report, Yost notes the average time death row inmates spend waiting for execution has grown to 22 years. At this point they’re more likely to die by suicide or natural causes than state corrections officials carrying out the sentence.
Throughout, Yost heaps scorn on Ohio’s approach to the death penalty. He describes it as a “ponderous machine” that is “essentially paralyzed” capable of producing “churn, waste and endless lawsuits — and little else.”
“This system satisfies nobody,” Yost argues. “Those who oppose the death penalty want it abolished altogether. Those who support the death penalty want it to be fair, timely and effective. Neither side is getting what it wants.”
Ohio AG Yost continues to back capital punishment despite system’s shortcomings

The report takes swipes at the way exonerations are discussed and the role of pharmaceutical companies. Defendants acquitted at retrial for lack of evidence or a prosecutor’s dismissal haven’t been proven innocent, Yost insists. “To state it plainly, guilty people sometimes beat the rap.” And pharmaceutical companies refusing to sell the state drugs used in lethal injection are “imped(ing) the laws of our nation,” according to Yost.
Yost’s solution for this self-described “stalemate” is to work with the U.S. Department of Justice to secure the necessary drugs or for state lawmakers to approve legislation allowing execution with nitrogen gas.
“There are two paths available to Ohio to enforce the laws on our books,” Yost states. “Pick one.”
Opponents’ view
Yost’s description of the capital punishment system’s shortcomings was so strong that Ohioans to Stop Executions quoted him to begin their own report.
Capital punishment “burns enormous amounts of effort, time and money, all to no purpose,” Yost stated. “It is a system that fails to deliver on the promise of justice for victims and their families, while wasting millions of taxpayer dollars.”
With that in mind, the organization contends, it’s time for Ohio to cut its losses and find a better solution.
“It’s time for Ohio to stop spending millions of dollars to prop up this broken system,” Ohioans to Stop Executions Executive Director Kevin Werner argued. “Repealing the death penalty is not just fiscally responsible, it is a moral and practical necessity.”
Alongside Werner, two people whose loved ones were murdered argued the death penalty is the wrong consequence. Sister Joanne Gross of the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland described how a member of her order, Sister Joanne Marie Mascha, was raped and murdered 30 years ago.
“Despite our public opposition to the death penalty, the prosecutors were not deterred and pursued death anyway,” she explained. “Only a jury’s mistake on the verdict forms resulted in the young man not facing the death penalty at sentencing, which was an answer to our prayers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Late last year the man convicted of murdering Mascha sent the sisters a letter, Gross said, “taking responsibility for his actions and seeking forgiveness.”
Rev. Jack Sullivan explained in 1997 he learned that his 21-year-old sister had been shot and killed in her home. He argued his family is one of many with “absolutely no confidence in the death penalty.”
“As we know, executions possess no life-restoring powers,” he said, “and offer no life honoring properties.”
Sullivan added, “Executions cannot mend broken heart(s) but only create more. They cannot heal grieving souls but only create more. And they cannot provide ever-elusive closure.”
Werner argued the state is at an impasse, and finding a new source for drugs or allowing executions with nitrogen gas won’t solve the system’s underlying problems. Those changes won’t make the legal process faster or cheaper, address wrongful convictions or provide support to victims’ families.
“It doesn’t fix a single problem,” Werner argued. “It feels a little bit more like a like a political thing, than it does good public policy that has outcomes that are both desired and needed.”

(Graham County Public Library)“An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone.”
Let’s hear it for humanities!
In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. The legislation combines technical information needed for a new law with aspirational language needed to describe its purpose: An advanced civilization, along with investing in science and technology, must also “give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.”
The legislation established the National Endowment for the Humanities, which was designed to keep Americans engaged and thinking about democracy and ideas. The work of state humanities councils — there is one in every state and territory, including Humanities Kansas — has been embraced by millions of Americans participating in activities like local preservation projects, community conversations, and local exhibits. This work has also been supported by every Congress for the last 60 years.
Until now.
On April 2, Humanities Kansas received a letter from the Department of Government Efficiency terminating the federal grant that carries out the intent of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. This has significant implications for our state and nation.
Federal funds are appropriated by Congress to the National Endowment for the Humanities and then sent out to the state humanities councils, like Humanities Kansas, that are charged with distributing the funds across their state. It’s a process that works.
Why would the United States government have responsibility to fund projects that explore history and literature and support community treasures like museums and libraries? Because, as the Act explains, democracy depends on the exchange of ideas.
The creation and passage of the 1965 Arts and Humanities Act did not occur in a vacuum, writes historian Jason Steinhauer in a recent History Club commentary.
The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, the growth and popularity of television, and a cultural focus on technological advancement led a group of passionate Americans to convince members of Congress from both parties that our position in the world — and our very democracy — would be threatened without a serious investment in strengthening civic engagement through arts and humanities.
“Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens,” the legislation states. “It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.”
That statement, and the entire act, is as relevant today as it was then.
My colleague Adam Davis, executive director of Oregon Humanities, shared in a recent podcast how the state humanities councils do this work: “Person by person, room by room, community by community.”
This is true in Kansas, too.
  Ann Dean presents “The Power of Imagery during the Civil Rights Movement” at the Gordon Parks Museum. (Ann Dean)
Last year, Humanities Kansas, using federal funds designated to us, supported 488 events in 126 communities. The events are local — person by person, community by community. The Cherryvale Museum volunteers sat down and interviewed local Vietnam War veterans. The Republic County Historical Museum worked with filmmakers to tell the story of a once thriving town named Minersville, now long gone, built on Kansas’s lignite coal industry.
Historians partnered with Humanities Kansas to create a special speakers bureau to explore the legacy of the 1954 landmark Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka on its 70th anniversary. Four speakers were invited to speak 32 times in 25 different Kansas communities over the course of a year. And free tickets to the U.S. Poet Laureate’s appearance in Salina, as part of an event created by Humanities Kansas, the Salina Art Center, and Salina Arts and Humanities, sold out in 22 minutes. Kansans love the humanities. Demand for humanities resources continue to rise.
Kansans and Kansas organizations turn to Humanities Kansas because they’re looking for something — a financial boost to get a project to the finish line, inspiration from talented authors and thinkers, a chance to connect with others. And Kansans connect with the humanities in ways that make sense to them. It might be through attending local history presentations, poetry hikes, oral histories, book discussions, film festivals, exhibitions and community festivals. It might be collecting recipes from family members passed down by our grandparents or learning about heirloom gardens and growing heritage tomatoes.
These are all activities rooted in stories — stories of our families, our communities, and our nation. These are stories that connect people to place and show us what we, as Kansans and Americans, have valued over time and across generations. They show us what it means to be part of a democracy.
Kansans are engaging with democracy through humanities programming created by and for the local community with a boost, when needed, by Humanities Kansas. At events that are free and open to the public, we see communities invested in civic engagement: “What would happen if you shared your idea, and I shared my idea and then together we came up with an even better idea?”
Isn’t that what we all want? Something better? For our communities and our nation? It’s a movement of ideas. It’s how we strengthen our democracy and honor our country. It’s how we move forward. It’s what the 1965 law intended.
Let’s make sure our Kansas stories — community by community — are preserved.

Feeling tariff whiplash? You’re not alone. On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs – a 10% levy on nearly all U.S. imports, along with targeted duties aimed at punishing countries he accuses of exploiting American markets. Just a week later, on April 9, his administration abruptly paused much of the plan for 90 days, leaving markets and allies scrambling for clarity.
The proposed tariffs were pitched as a way to revive U.S. manufacturing, reclaim jobs and counter what Trump considers unfair trade practices. But they immediately rattled the financial markets and raised alarms among economists and America’s global partners. Critics across the political spectrum revived a familiar warning: “beggar-thy-neighbor.”
History shows that such policies rarely succeed. In today’s interconnected world, they’re more likely to provoke swift, precise and painful retaliation.
 What is the ‘beggar-thy-neighbor’ strategy?

The phrase comes from economic history and refers to protectionist measures – tariffs, import restrictions or currency manipulation – designed to boost one country’s economy at the expense of its trading partners. Think of it like cleaning your yard by dumping the trash into your neighbor’s property: It looks tidy on your side until they respond.
This approach starkly contrasts with the principles laid out by Adam Smith. In “The Wealth of Nations,” he argued that trade is not a zero-sum game. Specialization and open markets, he observed, create mutual benefit – a rising tide that lifts all boats. Trump’s tariffs disregard this logic.
And history backs Smith. In the 1930s, the U.S. adopted a similar strategy to the one Trump is experimenting with through the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, raising duties to protect domestic jobs. The result was a wave of global retaliation that choked international trade and worsened the Great Depression.
 A case in point: Lesotho

As an example, consider the 50% tariff the United States imposed on imports from Lesotho, a small landlocked African nation. The measure took effect at midnight on April 3 but was reportedly subject to the 90-day pause starting midday April 4.
The tariff rate was calculated by taking the U.S. trade deficit with Lesotho – US$234.5 million in 2024 – dividing that by the total value of Lesotho’s exports to the U.S., or $237.3 million, and dividing that by two.
The 50% tariff would have a negligible effect on the U.S. economy – after all, out of the $3.3 trillion the U.S. imported in 2024, only a tiny fraction came from Lesotho. But for Lesotho, a nation that relies heavily on garment exports and preferential U.S. market access, the consequences would be severe. Using the same tariff logic across all partners, big or small, overlooks basic economic realities: differences in scale, trade capacity and vulnerability. It epitomizes beggar-thy-neighbor thinking: offloading domestic frustrations onto weaker economies for short-term political optics.
Lesotho is just one example. Even countries that import more from the U.S. than they export, such as Australia and the U.K., haven’t been spared. This “scoreboard” mentality – treating trade deficits as losses and surpluses as wins – risks reducing the complexity of global commerce to a tit-for-tat game.
 The return of a familiar — and risky — playbook

Such thinking has consequences. During Trump’s first term, China retaliated against U.S. tariffs by slashing imports of American soybeans and pork. As a result, those exports plummeted from $14 billion in 2017 to just $3 billion in 2018, hitting politically sensitive states like Iowa hard. The European Union responded to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs by threatening to target bourbon from Kentucky and motorcycles from Wisconsin – iconic products from the home states of former GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. Canada and the European Union have shown a willingness to use similar tactics this time around.
This isn’t new. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30% on imported steel, prompting the European Union to threaten retaliatory tariffs targeting products such as Florida citrus and Carolina textiles made in key swing states. Facing domestic political pressure and a World Trade Organization ruling against the measure, Bush reversed course within 21 months.
A decade earlier, the Clinton administration endured a long-running trade dispute with the EU known as the “banana wars,” in which European regulators structured import rules that disadvantaged U.S.-backed Latin American banana exporters in favor of former European colonies.
During the Obama years, the U.S. increased visa fees that disproportionately impacted India’s technology services sector. India responded by delaying approvals for American drugmakers and large retail investments.
Not all forms of trade retaliation grab headlines. Many are subtle, slow and bureaucratic – but no less damaging. Customs officials can delay paperwork or may impose arbitrary inspection or labeling requirements. Approval for U.S. pharmaceuticals, tech products or chemicals can be stalled for vague procedural reasons. Public procurement rules can be quietly rewritten to exclude U.S. companies.
While these tactics rarely draw public attention, their cumulative cost is real: missed delivery deadlines, lost contracts and rising operational costs. Over time, American businesses may shift operations abroad – not because of labor costs or regulation at home, but to escape the slow drip of bureaucratic punishment they experience elsewhere.
 Tariffs in a connected economy

Supporters of tariffs often argue that they protect domestic industries and create jobs. In theory, they might. But in practice, recent history shows they are more likely to invite retaliation, raise prices and disrupt supply chains.
Modern manufacturing is deeply interconnected. A product may involve assembling components from a dozen countries, moving back and forth across borders. Tariffs hurt foreign suppliers and American manufacturers, workers and consumers.
More strategically damaging, they erode U.S. influence. Allies grow weary of unpredictable trade moves, and rivals, including China and Russia, step in to forge deeper partnerships. Countries may reduce their exposure to the U.S. dollar, sell off Treasury bonds, or align with regional blocs like the BRICS group – led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – not out of ideology, but necessity.
In short, the U.S. weakens its own strategic hand. The long-term cost isn’t just economic – it’s geopolitical.
Rather than resorting to beggar-thy-neighbor tactics, the U.S. could secure its future by investing in what truly drives long-term strength: smart workforce development, breakthrough innovation  and savvy partnerships with allies. This approach would tackle trade imbalances through skillful diplomacy instead of brute force, while building resilience at home by equipping American workers and companies to thrive – not by scapegoating others.
History makes a clear case: Ditching the obsession with bilateral trade deficits and focusing instead on value creation pays off. The U.S. can source components from around the world and elevate them through unmatched design, innovation and manufacturing excellence. That’s the heartbeat of real economic might.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
Black colleges ponder their future as Trump makes cuts to education dollars

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Stock photo by IronHeart/Getty Images)In 2016, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and its Division of Behavioral Health, as a part of its strategic plan, identified the need to study of the costs associated with providing mental health and substance use disorder services.
Agency leaders believed the findings of this study would help them ensure “statewide capacity and access to behavioral health services.”
That cost modeling, which looked at behavioral health services, identified state reimbursement rates far below the costs associated with providing care. Many services were receiving 7% to 35% below actual costs.
The Nebraska Legislature and Appropriations Committee Chairman John Stinner and Vice Chair Kate Bolz led needed efforts to increase rates. This, in turn, allowed providers to expand and improve access to care and take steps to maintain and expand workforce.
Funding priorities
Unfortunately, too many people still cannot afford access to mental health care, and that is why the Legislature should continue making behavioral health care a priority. Medicaid is one of the primary payers for mental health and substance use disorder services, resulting in many of our community providers relying on those rates for a high percentage of their revenues.
Providers are paid for their services through a managed
care system in which the state contracts with insurance companies, which then negotiate reimbursement rates with providers.
The Legislature appropriates funds for the Medicaid program, which includes provider rates. Each July, after the start of a new fiscal year, the Medicaid division posts the legislatively approved rates.
These rates are what managed care companies use when negotiating contracts with providers. But uncertain times have providers worried about maintaining their services and meeting the needs of their clients. So they need to know that the rates appropriated by the Legislature will be the minimum rate they receive.
Potential changes
One way to do this is Legislative Bill 380, a proposal from State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha aimed at tightening up managed care and provider audit statutes.
The bill establishes that posted rates will be the floor for rates paid to providers. Knowing that they won’t be paid less than what the Legislature budgets gives providers, who are business people, too, some assurances for maintaining and growing their workforce.
Businesses require such certainty to add services and meet people where they live. Addressing this planning issue is critical to ensuring that the progress Nebraska mental health and substance use disorder providers have made is not jeopardized.
Statistics around mental illness and substance use disorders are still disturbing. In Nebraska, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds and 25- to 34-year-olds. We have four times more deaths by suicide than car accidents.
One in six youth ages 6 to 17, and one in three young adults ages 18 to 25, struggle with a mental illness. Yet we know that many people do not receive the care they need for these treatable illnesses.
We must continue building a strong, more resilient system of care that improves access and helps us, as a state, to keep moving the trends involving mental health in the right direction.
Annette Dubas was the first executive director for the Nebraska Association of Behavioral Health Organizations (NABHO). She began that role after serving eight years as a state senator.

John McCosh/Georgia Recorder“It’s our mission to enhance your college experience through the internationalization of campus,” the University of Georgia tells its 2,600 foreign students on its website. “No matter your held identity, perspective and worldview, there’s a place for everyone.”
Except, there’s not a place for everyone. 
Not anymore.
All around the country, including here in Georgia, hundreds and most likely thousands of foreign students are being stripped of their student visas for little or no apparent reason, and are told to either deport themselves immediately or be arrested and deported by force. 
Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under pressure to meet deportation quotas, have found those students to be easy pickings. They’re simple to find – their names and addresses are already in a federal database – and ICE agents are apparently sifting through that database, trying to find any reason, plausible or implausible, to evict people.
In some cases, students are being targeted for voicing support for Palestinians, not necessarily in protests but on social media and other outlets as well. One student in Vermont, a 10-year U.S. resident with a green card, was arrested for deportation at an interview that he scheduled as part of his process to become an American citizen, and we still don’t know the reason. Others have been ordered to leave the country immediately based on years-old traffic tickets or dropped misdemeanor charges, and some based on no apparent reason at all. 
Lawsuits have been filed in federal courts here in Georgia and elsewhere, attempting to force the government to justify its actions, but the outcome of those suits is uncertain. The fact that there’s so little rhyme or reason to the deportation orders, which come with no warning, makes them even more frightening and dangerous. These aren’t terrorists or criminals who are being targeted. They are people who came here legally, through the process, and the random nature of their attempted removal makes the message clear: 
Immigrants, get out.
The impact here in Georgia can be significant. Emory University hosts roughly 3,300 foreign undergraduates and more than 1,000 post-graduate students and scholars, many in the medical field. Kennesaw State enrolls more than 1,600 international students, and Georgia State has more than twice that number.
Not surprisingly, Georgia Tech hosts the largest contingent of international students in the state. In addition to more than 1,600 undergraduate students, Tech has attracted almost 12,000 post-graduate students to its campus, representing the best and the brightest of more than 100 countries. They make up more than a third of Tech’s post-grad student body.
Those students and the often-cutting-edge research they conduct have in turn helped to attract venture capital, startups and incubators to Georgia Tech’s Technology Square in midtown Atlanta. Companies such as NCR, Boeing and others have invested more than $1 billion in projects at Tech Square, which according to Georgia Tech has “the highest density of startups, corporate innovators, academic researchers, and students in the entire southeastern United States,” with “over 100 startups, 5 startup accelerators, 25 corporate innovation centers, 7 venture funds, 10 research labs, 10 Top 10 engineering programs (and) one Top 10 MBA program.”
These are, or ought to be, the foundations upon which a modern, prosperous economy are built. In fact, according to one study, “21 of the 87 privately held U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more had a founder who first came to the United States as an international student.” 
Yet we’re in the process of running them off.
In addition, foreign students are a big revenue generator for many schools, because they generally are able and willing to pay full tuition, in effect subsidizing their U.S. classmates. If the flow of international students and revenue is shut down, as seems likely, some smaller private schools may even be forced to close. Overall, higher education is an American specialty, an “industry” renowned around the world for its quality, and we’re locking the doors to incoming customers. 
The impact of these deportation attempts goes well beyond those individuals being targeted for removal. Word has already spread overseas, where these evictions are creating a climate of fear and distrust that will last generations. To make things even worse, the Trump regime is also attempting to slash funding for American scholars who want to study and do research overseas, through programs such as the Fulbright. 
What supposedly began as a concern about illegal immigration has grown into something much uglier and destructive. We are shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world. We are telling them we don’t want their business, we don’t want their friendship, we don’t want them.
It’s just crazy what we’re doing to ourselves.

Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy addressed the sudden termination of two vital USDA programs: the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) and the Local Food For Schools Cooperative Agreement Program (LFSP). 
These critical programs allowed food banks and schools to source food from local small farmers, strengthening both community food access and local agriculture.
To bolster local food supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration launched this pair of USDA programs. In 2021, leveraging American Rescue Plan funding, the USDA distributed $1 billion in grants to states, enabling school districts, food banks, and distribution hubs nationwide to purchase produce, meat, dairy, and other minimally processed foods directly from over 8,000 local farmers. These programs essentially provided small, diversified farms with direct market access to community institutions.
The LFPA and LFSP initiatives not only fortified regional supply chains and fostered crucial stakeholder partnerships, but also improved the health and well-being of all students and food insecure families. Furthermore, they injected vital financial capital into small farming enterprises. 
This nationwide investment of hundreds of millions of dollars yielded significant positive outcomes for community health and local food economies, reflecting a strategically sound policy approach. Recognizing the programs’ success, President Biden allocated $1.1 billion in late 2024 to extend their reach and continue to build resiliency within local food systems. Farmers, school food service directors, and food banks, having established strong connections with food hubs, eagerly anticipated this continuation, with farmers already having invested in seeds and planting.
State agencies nationwide, including those in Connecticut, received notification on March 7, that the $1.1 billion second funding round for the LFPA and LFSP programs had been terminated due to a shift in priorities and cost-saving efforts, diverging from the previous administration’s objectives.
“Let’s be clear,” said Renee Giroux, farmer and founder of the Northwest Connecticut Food Hub, who spoke on behalf of small Connecticut farmers at the press conference, “This isn’t just about numbers. It’s about real people, real farms, and real families. At a time when food insecurity is rising and local farms are struggling to survive, we should be strengthening programs like LFPA and LFSP, not cutting them. Local food production and direct distribution to the local community is good for our health, economy and environment.”
The cancellation’s repercussions for Connecticut are significant: $9.3 million that would have continued to strengthen local agriculture, student resources, and food security initiatives, will no longer be available.
Let’s break down the numbers:
The Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) aimed to connect Connecticut farms directly with food pantries. From 2023 to 2025, the CT Department of Agriculture received $6.7 million from the USDA for this initiative, and expected an additional $3.7 million. 
CT Foodshare, a key partner, received $3 million initially and was slated to receive an additional $1 million before the program’s cancellation. This funding enabled them to supply fresh produce from local farms to pantries statewide. 
“The loss of this funding is immense,” a spokesperson for Connecticut Foodshare said, “and it has a direct impact on both the people we serve as well as our local farm partners. The program would have enabled us to provide millions of fresh, Connecticut-grown meals to the one in eight Connecticut residents (including one in six children) experiencing food insecurity.”
The Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program (LFSP), designed to bring local farm products to schools, provided the Connecticut Department of Education with $1.873 million from the USDA between 2022 and 2025. Prior to its cancellation, an additional $5.6 million was planned. This second round of funding included $4.6 million for K-12 schools and $1 million for early childhood education centers. 
Ashley Carl, Director of Food and Nutrition Services in Plainville states, “The funding from LFSP has been essential in allowing us to provide students with locally sourced foods. Without this support, maintaining the diverse range of local offerings on our limited budget would be an enormous challenge.”
We have to ask ourselves, what could possibly be a higher priority than ensuring students and those facing food insecurity have access to nutritious food, while simultaneously supporting the economic health of Connecticut’s small farms?
As local leaders, deeply invested in a just, regenerative and resilient food system, we ask for your help. Contact your federal representatives immediately. Urge them to demand that the USDA reinstate funding for the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program (LFPA) and the Local Food for Schools Program (LFSP).
Contact your district’s delegation immediately. Urge them to support H.B. 7013, “An Act Concerning Enhancements To The Local Food For Schools Incentive Program And The CT Grown For CT Kids Grant Program,” currently under consideration.

Unfortunately, instead of properly funding towns, the Democratic majority has once again relied on budgetary gimmicks —not to improve education, but to circumvent their own fiscal rules.
For years, Democratic leadership has put Connecticut’s municipalities at the bottom of the priority list. Their spending formula is clear: state employees and their benefits come first, then the massive entitlement bureaucracy that supports them. Only after that do they consider municipal aid. The result is skyrocketing property taxes as towns are forced to make up for the state’s shortfalls.
I have always prioritized municipal aid because funding towns properly reduces the pressure to raise property taxes, something Connecticut desperately needs. That’s why I supported the original $40 million special-education funding bill when it passed unanimously earlier this year. Then, Gov. Ned Lamont inexplicably vetoed it. 

State Sen. Rob Sampson
Normally, this would lead to an easy override vote. Instead, Democrats saw an opportunity to sidestep their own spending caps and funneled the same $40 million into an off-the-books account using “emergency certification”—a process that bypasses public hearings and committee review, leaving taxpayers in the dark.
There was no reason to avoid a transparent process other than to evade Connecticut’s bipartisan fiscal guardrails —rules designed to protect taxpayers from reckless spending. These same Democrats had unanimously supported these budget guardrails (also known as spending caps) in early 2023 at the urging of legislative Republicans. Governor Lamont himself recently called them “sacrosanct.” However, when following them became inconvenient, they chose to ignore them.
If their goal had been to truly help students, they would have had a better option. Republicans responded to this maneuver by proposing an amendment to more than double the funding —offering $92.2 million for special education within the budget guardrails. Every Democrat voted that amendment down —making it less about funding schools and more about bending financial rules to fit their agenda.
At the same time, Democrats approved another bill that funnels $3 million to politically connected advocacy groups, including organizations focused on illegal immigration and gender-affirming care. 
Among the recipients were: Planned Parenthood, which received $800,000 despite having over $2.5 billion in assets; Hartford Gay and Lesbian Health Collective, which received $387,500; New Haven Gay and Lesbian Community Center, which received $225,000; Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, which received $225,000; Junta for Progressive Action, which received $62,500; and Anchor Health Initiative, which received $62,500. These organizations were hand-picked with no public vetting and there will be nearly zero oversight on how these taxpayer dollars are spent.
Meanwhile, Connecticut families struggle with affordability. Electric rates remain artificially high due to the public benefits charge, which Republicans are fighting to remove. Property taxes are among the highest in the nation, yet towns are forced to beg for funding while millions go to well-connected special interest groups.
To put this in perspective, I offered an amendment redirecting this $3 million toward Meals on Wheels for seniors and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program—funding that would help those most in need. Democrats voted it down on party lines.
What happened in the legislature weeks ago wasn’t just fiscal irresponsibility; it was a blatant display of misplaced priorities.
Special education funding should be managed transparently and responsibly. Instead, Democrats exploited it to undermine Connecticut’s hard-fought budget stability while simultaneously directing taxpayer money to ideological groups with no accountability.
If we want a government that serves the people, we must hold lawmakers accountable for following the budget rules they themselves voted into law. We need to properly fund municipal aid to reduce property tax burdens. We must stop politically motivated spending and focus on real affordability solutions.
I will continue fighting for responsible budgeting, protecting taxpayers, and demanding transparency. If the majority refuses to put Connecticut residents first, then it is up to the public to demand better.

Connecticut leads the charge in the fight to preserve the American rule of law. Whether native to Hartford or Peru, our elected officials have answered the call to sustain our democracy. In Washington, D.C., U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy’s fervent advocacy is meticulous. Laying out a comprehensive timeline of an unprecedented incidence of corruption, Murphy is a bulwark on the senate floor. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has lucidly tracked critical votes and federal developments, keeping Connecticut in the know amidst unprecedented change.
Speaking at a town hall in Greenwich, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, fellow first-generation, Connecticut-native, and U.S. House Representative Jim Himes went directly to the people. As attorneys general across the nation prepare for extensive legal battles, Tong emphasized the importance of checks, balances and our own civic participation at the local level. As I contemplated writing these very words, Rep. Jim Himes called me into a telephonic town hall with my neighbors. Their message is resoundingly clear: Do not despair. Organize.
I am proud to see our elected officials on the frontlines of this fight. Their efforts, however, should offer us no comfort. Dr. Martin Luther King was arrested for standing up for his beliefs. Writing a letter to generations to come from a jail cell in Birmingham, Dr. King expressed profound disappointment in the moderate “who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action’.” 
We voted for leaders who we believed would stand up for Connecticut. In so doing, we do not cast aside our own responsibility to do the same.
The Constitution State was present for the birth of American democracy. As a second year Harvard law student, I write home to plead that we continue to sustain the same American values and ideals that I grew up believing in. We live in overwhelming times, but it is not in our nature to sit idle. I am grateful to our senators, our attorney general, my own congressional representative for their example to us. 
But we all have a role to play. Whether its standing on principle as a corporate law firm, making the tough editorial decisions to ensure the free press remain free, or even donating your time or money to local causes, there is still work to be done. Don’t despair. Organize.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)With Utah public universities preparing to make cuts on what may be considered low-performing programs to comply with a new state law, different institutions are quickly making plans to merge colleges, and to lay off some of their staff.
This year the Utah Legislature approved HB265, giving instructions to the Utah Board of Higher Education to cut 10% of budgets for courses and switch that funding from “underperforming programs” to degrees that may have waitlists. That left universities scrambling to meet the state-imposed deadlines starting with a first draft of the plans due on May 9 to the Utah Board of Higher Education. 
While that’s the initial deadline, the schools have three years to implement their plans in order to receive the ongoing total of $60 million retained by the state in a “strategic reinvestment account” meant to be spent on high-demand programs.

Salt Lake Community College, which has to cut $5.2 million to invest in other areas, is gathering leaders at the institution to evaluate their instructional budget considering factors such as completion time, outcomes and workforce demand, said Jason Pickavance, interim provost for the office of Academic Affairs at the college.
Budget bills targeting ‘underperforming’ university programs press forward

Reallocations within schools weren’t invented with the bill, Pickavance said. They are a routine exercise the college goes through to update its curriculum and keep up with what’s needed in the workforce. Already having a system in place is what may make this process even more challenging, he added, since programs have already been streamlined. 
“One of the things I’ve done to make the exercise more achievable is I’ve extended it to non-instructional areas of Academic Affairs,” Pickavance said. Those areas include a curriculum office, testing services, a library and an e-learning office. “One of the charges to the deans and the associate provosts is to consider not just looking at instruction, but thinking about how they might consolidate staff or administration in their area.”
That means that as part of the reallocation process, there could be layoffs to decrease the number of academic administrators — which include associate deans, directors, deans and associate provosts. Other staff lines would also be consolidated.
As for programs, that’s still under consideration since their effectiveness evaluation is more nuanced than simple enrollment and graduation metrics. 
SLCC’s dental hygiene program, for example, is a small program that admits about 25 students per cohort, he said. But that’s partly because there’s a fixed number of stations where instructors can teach. So, that program, despite its demand and success won’t be getting larger anytime soon. 
“They graduate every one of those students, and every one of those students goes and gets a job,” Pickavance said. “So that program, to me, is a very small, but high performing program.”
But programs like, say, psychology, which has hundreds of students a year, don’t have those kinds of equipment constraints and are designed to transfer students to other institutions, and not necessarily to get them directly in the workforce. 
“The technical challenges we came up with as we were thinking about ‘how do we want to evaluate programs?’ is that programs are very varied in their purpose and in their scope,” he said. “And you really want to think about is a program accomplishing what it’s intending to accomplish, not holding a program to some rigid one-size-fits-all metric.”
So far, it has been an anxiety-inducing process, Pickavance said. While the college is working hard to be responsive and agile while managing taxpayer dollars, they are also trying to approach this from a humane perspective.
“We’re talking about staff or faculty, and I expect there will be some people that we have to let go,” he said. “I hope it’s minimal, and I hope that we’re really thinking carefully about, if we do have to discontinue, is there another spot in the college that we can find a space for them?”
USU is merging colleges and cutting staff
Utah State University, which must cut $12.5 million as part of the state’s reallocation project, is making two college mergers. 
The first will combine the Caine College of the Arts, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the College of Science, resulting in a new college “that aligns with common arts and sciences models nationally,” Alan Smith, interim president of USU said in an update. Joe Ward, the dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences is set to lead it.
The second will be a merger of the S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources and the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences into a new school “that aligns with those found at several thriving land-grant institutions,” Smith wrote. A dean of this new college is still to be determined. 


Let us know what you think...


 

“The restructuring of these colleges will be accompanied by department consolidations, moves, and reconfigurations that strengthen alignment and cohesion,” Smith said. “These changes will likely impact downstream programs, initiatives, and centers or institutes.”
At the end of March, Smith wrote in another message that “there will be no way to avoid job cuts,” since personnel are the primary cost of the institution, offering faculty and staff to apply for a “voluntary separation incentive plan,” with cash incentives depending on age and years of service.  
Under the new bill the university may also adopt policies that supersede other institutional policies to reach the goals, Smith wrote. So, “existing policies tied to curricular changes, tenured roles, and other areas will not be applied when implementing our HB 265 plan.”
University of Utah bracing to cut $19 million, plus federal cuts
The University of Utah saw this coming, Mitzi Montoya, senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said in a newsletter. In early 2024, the Utah System of Higher Education received an ongoing 1.5% cut in its budgets beginning this summer and heard that more could come in 2025, so the university had already anticipated a 10% reduction.
To save the $19.7 million the U. has to reallocate, each academic unit will meet to develop plans before the initial draft deadline coming up in May, Montoya said in an Academic Senate meeting on April 7.
“We’re focusing particular support on working with the deans that have programs that might be flagged as lower enrollment,” Montoya said in the meeting. “The task is to work on developing explanations of the data, potentially growing enrollment, or making whatever changes may need to happen from a curricular standpoint.”
Audit: Could cutting low-performing college programs help Utah’s academic outlook? 

Programs that have fewer than 40 students enrolled are to be considered “low enrollment,” a benchmark also used by the Utah System of Higher Education.
Some of the low enrollment but high impact programs that may be affected by the reallocations are mining engineering, metallurgical engineering and geological engineering. 
“We are also using our data to build a picture of the contributions of our smaller programs,” Montoya wrote in the newsletter. “We can’t know what the outcome of this process will be, but we do know that we will continue to be committed to the full swath of disciplines that make an R1 institution such as ours strong and contribute to research advancement.”
One of the goals at the state’s flagship university is also to invest to support student growth, Montoya said in the meeting. She noted that some areas where lawmakers would like to see growth are accounting, data science and nursing, all highlighted in the audit that inspired HB265.
With looming federal cuts, the university is also bracing for changes in its research department, guiding researchers to move with urgency, and “aligning discovery with national priorities,” according to a message from Erin Rothwell, the U.’s vice president for Research.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)A crowd of over 100 residents gathered in front of the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau on Wednesday, for a “pop-up” protest calling for due process and justice for a Maryland man mistakenly deported and imprisoned in El Salvador.  
“Protect the Constitution!” the crowd chanted, and demonstrators held hand-made signs reading: “Uphold the rule of law!” “Due process matters,” and “Bring Kilmar home.”
Outrage has grown across the country, with protests and town halls, around 30-year-old Kilmar Abrego Garcia — who was granted asylum in the U.S. due to threats of gang violence in 2019 — his mistaken arrest and deportation to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and ensuing court battle to bring him home. 
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the government must “facilitate” Garcia’s return to the U.S., but stopped short of requiring it. On Tuesday, a federal district court judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to show how it has tried to secure the release of Garcia. So far, the judge said the record shows “nothing has been done.”
The White House maintains it has no power to ask El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia from the mega-prison, and that the judge overstepped her authority in ordering the administration to conduct foreign affairs.
At the protest in Juneau, demonstrators gave impromptu speeches denouncing the Trump administration, calling it a violation of due process rights. Speakers called for protection and support for Alaska-based immigrant families, some who received notices to “leave now” and self-deport, some sent in error. They urged Alaskans to continue speaking out, including calling on U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan to do more in Congress. 
“Sending immigrants to an El Salvador prison that is likened to a concentration camp or a gulag, is just reprehensible,” said Mary Hakala, a lifelong Juneau resident in an interview after the protest. 
“(For) everyone in the United States, whether they’re an immigrant, a U.S. citizen, due process is what keeps us all safe,” she said. “And so if they are able to throw out and ignore the laws regarding the rights of citizens and immigrants, none of us are safe. It’s a very frightening time.”
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a key partner in the Trump administration’s new deportation and imprisonment effort, refused to assist with Garcia’s return in an Oval Office meeting on Monday. “Of course, I’m not going to do it,” he said. “The question is preposterous.”
At that meeting, President Trump expressed openness to deporting U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to El Salvador. “If it’s a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,” Trump told reporters. “We’re studying the laws right now… If we can do that, that’s good.”
The U.S. government is paying El Salvador to imprison immigrants, despite a federal law barring it from financially supporting foreign security forces facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.

Attorney Philip Thompson, who represented Sapelo residents Barbara Bailey, Christopher Bailey, and Stanley Walker set the scene, telling the justices, “The purpose of this petition is to protect and preserve the Hogg Hummock community, one of the last Gullah Geechee communities in the United States and a cultural and historical treasure, both for the state, but also for the country as well as a whole.”
The case stems from McIntosh’s decision in September 2023 to allow the construction of larger houses in the modest Hogg Hummock neighborhood. Long-time residents feared the resulting gentrification and the higher taxes that accompanied it would drive them out of their ancestral homes in favor of wealthy developers. The county seeks to expand its tax base.
About 96% of Sapelo is owned by the state. In the 434-acre neighborhood of Hogg Hummock, about 250 acres are owned by descendants of enslaved people brought to the island from West Africa. Hogg Hummock is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
To undo the 2023 zoning, residents mounted a petition drive that collected enough signatures to force the county to hold a referendum on the issue. Early voting had already begun in September when the county sued its own Probate Court Judge Harold Webster to stop the referendum. Superior Court Senior Judge Gary McCorvey then agreed with the county that the referendum wasn’t legal, halting the voting midstream.
In a separate, ongoing lawsuit nine Black residents of Sapelo are suing the county in McIntosh Superior Court on the grounds that the zoning measure was unjust and discriminatory. Attorneys from Southern Poverty Law Center and Bondurant, Mixson & Elmore are representing the residents.
Arguments heard Wednesday
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the appeal of McCorvey’s decision Wednesday. Two other related cases were heard at the same time: Webster v. McIntosh County, and McIntosh County v. Webster et. al. These two cases deal directly with McIntosh’s Webster’s approval of the referendum.
The state constitution’s “Home Rule” provision lays out the referendum process, which allows for a vote on “local acts or ordinances, resolutions, or regulations” if the requisite number of county residents sign a petition requesting it.
It’s not the first time a referendum issue has come before the high court. Camden County held a referendum on a proposed spaceport in 2022. The county objected to the referendum in Camden v. Sweatt, but in a unanimous decision the high court affirmed the validity of that vote.
Much of Wednesday’s hearing dealt with whether referenda can be employed to revoke zoning decisions. The county contends the Home Rule provision doesn’t apply to zoning, while the residents and Webster say it does. The justices probed both sides, trying to discern the original intent of lawmakers in a maze of paragraphs and subparagraphs. The questions turned esoteric at times.
“You have paragraph (a) that expressly reserves to the General Assembly, I think, a sort of substantive power to expand or limit anything that comes under that,” said Justice Andrew Pinson. “And then in paragraph four, it reserves to the General Assembly the more limited power to enact procedural things. And so I see there’s sort of a tension between, if zoning comes under (a) what about four?”
Those questions reflected the need to clarify the little-used provision of the Constitution, Thompson said.
“The justices were clearly very well prepared and very tuned in to the difficulties presented by the language of the Constitution,” Thompson told The Current after the hearing. “By language that hasn’t been tested a lot, certainly not on the scale it was tested in the Camden case and now tested here. We feel confident in our position. It’s only a good thing that the judges were so keyed in.”
The justices also examined the fact that the county was suing its own probate judge in his official capacity.
“He’s a county official, right? asked Chief Justice Nels S. D. Peterson. “So isn’t a suit by the county against a county official in their official capacity, essentially a suit by the county against the county?”
The situation means that McIntosh is paying for the attorneys on both sides of its case against Webster.
Several justices seemed concerned that the zoning ordinance in question was not included in the filings.
“So if we don’t have that in the record, what is the court to do?” asked Justice Verda M. Colvin. Jarrard referred them to the language of the referendum question.
The hearing lasted about 45 minutes and can be viewed here.
“McIntosh County appreciated the opportunity to present its position to the Georgia Supreme Court,” Jarrard said. “The County looks forward to receipt of the Court’s ruling.”

“As long as this is accurate it’s OK. Might stir up some media attention,” Dan Welch, the former GOP chair texted to the paid executive director of the party in October of 2020.
“It was a tough piece,” Welch said, telling jurors he “hated attack ads,” but felt they were permitted if accurate and relevant to the race, including one pitting two Republicans against each other — Janet Palmtag, the owner of a Nebraska City real estate firm, and incumbent State Sen. Julie Slama.
Ryan Hamilton, the party’s executive director, responded in an email and in a phone conversation with Welch that he was “certain” it was true, and that he had read a consent agreement signed by the Iowa Real Estate Commission that backed up the accuracy “if anyone questions this.”
The testimony came during the third day of a trial over the alleged defamation of Palmtag by the Nebraska Republican Party during a contentious state legislative campaign in southeast Nebraska.
Palmtag, a long-time GOP volunteer who was backed by several prominent Republicans, lost the 2020 election to Slama, who was appointed to her seat and supported by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts. Three months after the election Palmtag filed a civil lawsuit alleging she was defamed. She is seeking damages from the state GOP for lost business and emotional distress.
Must prove actual malice
Palmtag, who is being represented by prominent Omaha attorney Dave Domina, must prove that the GOP acted with “actual malice” or reckless disregard for the facts in sending out the mailers, which she has labeled as “lies.”

The case is viewed as an important one in the arena of political campaign speech, with the potential to set how far “hit pieces” can go in attacking a rival candidate.
Palmtag testified on Monday that she had voluntarily dropped her Iowa real estate license, and that of her firm, J.J. Palmtag Inc., because the market in the Hawkeye State near Nebraska City had been ruined by flooding.
Palmtag said that she had reached a “consent agreement” with the Iowa commission in 2018 to resolve a mistake made by a gravely ill salesman who had worked for her. She paid a $500 but admitted no violation of state laws. While everyone received their proper payments, the salesman had failed to get all the signatures required in Iowa to transfer an earnest deposit for the sale.
On Wednesday, Welch, an attorney and former member of the Omaha City Council, took the stand to tell jurors that in his opinion, an Iowa law had been broken.
But when asked by Domina if he now feels that Palmtag “lost her license” as the mailers stated, Welch’s answer was nuanced.
“What I now question is how she lost her license, and I don’t know the answer to that,” Welch said.
On Monday, the GOP’s lead attorney, Kamron Hasan told jurors that Hamilton had read the consent agreement and it stated that J.J. Palmtag “had not contested the alleged violation” of Iowa real estate law, and had looked up the status of the company and it read that its license had been “cancelled.”
That, Hasan said, showed that the claims in the campaign mailers were true.
Impact of ads
On Wednesday, Palmtag’s local physician and family friend, Dr. Bradley Vasa, testified that she is still being treated for symptoms of depression brought on by the campaign mailers he labeled “a hit piece” and “false.”

“She changed after that,” Dr. Vasa said, following the mailers from the Nebraska GOP.
Palmtag was “more withdrawn” and less visible in Nebraska City, he said, and fewer “J.J. Palmtag” for-sale signs were visible around town.
Vasa also testified that Palmtag had been treated successfully for intermittent anxiety and migraine headaches prior to 2020, but insisted her condition had worsened after the contentious campaign.
Palmtag’s ex-husband, John, also testified that their 40-year marriage ended in part due to the hurt caused by the campaign claims he labeled as untrue.
Friends and local residents tended to believe they were true, he added, because they came from the party instead of an independent “dark money” group.
One long-time friend of Palmtag’s, Sara Crook, a retired Peru State professor, said she had noticed that Palmtag’s usually upbeat and outgoing personality had changed after the harsh campaign claims made against her in the 2020 campaign.
“In a small town, your reputation means a lot,” Crook said. “It hurt her reputation.”
“If a political party can turn on you,” she added, “how can we get good people to run for office?”
Testimony, via depositions from Hamilton and others, is expected to continue tomorrow with closing arguments scheduled Friday morning.

“This budget continues the success that North Carolina has seen in the last decade-and-a-half,” said Sen. Brent Jackson (R-Sampson), a lead budget writer.

The legislation would cut hundreds of vacant state government positions, and some filled jobs. Under the plan, educators would see an average 2.3% raise next year and bonuses across two years. Most state employees would receive 1.25% raises and two-year bonuses; correctional officers, law enforcement officers, and highway patrol officers would receive more extensive boosts.
It also increases the subsidy rate for child care providers, sets up money for future Hurricane Helene recovery and funds a new children’s hospital to be built in the Triangle, among other provisions.
Democrats have offered praise for parts of the budget, including pay raises that they say are overdue. But they urged more extensive investment, and warned that planned cuts to state jobs and income taxes did not meet the economic moment.
“Right now, North Carolina needs a record investment in its people, because our house is on fire,” said Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake). “But this budget sends a sympathy card to them instead, saying ‘sorry for your loss,’ instead of a fire truck.”
After a final vote in the Senate that’s expected Thursday, the proposal will go to the House, where members will write and pass their own version. A compromise between the two chambers will eventually go to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk. 
Debate on tax cuts and more as Democrats propose flurry of amendments
The Senate budget continues a plan for tax cuts, despite state economists’ warnings that North Carolina is facing a shortfall in the coming years. It keeps the previously planned cuts to personal income tax rates and continues the phase-out of the corporate income tax. 
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said earlier this week he did not believe the economic forecast, expressing faith that the state’s growth would continue to exceed expectations.
“What we have seen is the state’s economy continuing to grow and flourish,” Berger said this week.

Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) failed in his attempt Wednesday to stop the corporate income tax phase-out. The scheduled cuts primarily benefit the wealthy, he argued. 
“This is a cheapskate budget. We are not a cheapskate state,” Meyer said. 
“We are leaving North Carolinians behind,” he added, while creating “a structural deficit that is going to leave us in trouble for years to come.”
Among Democrats’ other proposed amendments was one from Sen. Kandie Smith (D-Edgecombe) that would have added a 10% earned income tax credit that Democrats have touted as a more equitable tax break. The state had such a credit earlier in the century, but it was repealed when Republicans gained control of the legislature in 2011. The amendment also proposed to cut the amount of money going toward the Opportunity Scholarships school voucher program.
Sen. Joyce Waddell (D-Mecklenburg) tried to add a 2% cost-of-living raise for state retirees. Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) sought to boost funding to the state’s struggling DMV. And Batch, the Democratic leader, offered a final unsuccessful amendment to raise the state’s minimum wage, as she decried the budget as “anemic.”
Berger, in his closing comments after almost five hours of debate, praised the budget and criticizing Democrats’ attempted amendments.
“The minority caucus, what do they offer the people of North Carolina?” Berger said. “Higher taxes, curtail options that parents have for their children’s education, increased debt, more bureaucracy and higher utility bills.”
Helene recovery
Senate Republicans’ plan sets aside $700 million for future aid in western North Carolina. Gov. Josh Stein is expected to outline a spending request in the coming weeks, after which lawmakers will draw up a new round of relief.
State officials remain wary of reduced and slow-moving money on the federal level.
“We remain hopeful that the federal government will provide increased and expedited reimbursement,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said Wednesday. “But we must be prepared to fend for ourselves.”
Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) ticked off a list of provisions she wished were in the budget to support the region. That included a grant program for small businesses and money to help local governments avoid looming shortfalls.
“Federal money is not flowing yet, and a lot of people are doing stuff about that but we can’t open that spigot,” Mayfield said.



Stein: Senate budget ‘falls short’
Stein, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the Senate’s budget “falls short.”
He added that he would work with lawmakers to “improve this budget” and send additional money to western North Carolina.
“We should be making investments in what makes North Carolina a great place to live: educating the next generation of North Carolinians, growing a strong workforce that drives our economy, and keeping communities safe,” Stein said in a statement.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1640-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 21:01:04.060001

Bernie Sanders pulled whistles and cheers out of a crowd of Montanans and fans from out of state on Wednesday at the University of Montana as part of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
“But it’s not just oligarchy and the power of the rich that we are fighting right now,” said Sanders, of Vermont. “We are taking on a president who undermines our constitution every day.”
  People drove from out of state to see Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez in Missoula in April 2025. An estimated 7,500 people filled the Adams Center with another 1,500 outside. Here, rallygoers wait to get into the stadium, some arriving as early as 5 a.m. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
The full-capacity crowd descended on the Adams Center at UM, some 7,500 people sitting in the bleachers and standing on the floor, with an estimated 1,500 more spilling far outside the doors.
“Brothers and sisters, we are tired of being oppressed,” Sanders said in a more than 30 minute speech that brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly. “We believe in democracy, not authoritarianism. We believe in an economy that works for all, not just for Musk and his fellow billionaires.”
Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats but stings them with criticism as well, said billionaire Elon Musk poured $270 million into the campaign of Republican U.S. President Donald Trump.
“His reward for that $270 million was to be made the most important person in the United States government,” Sanders said.
But he said Democratic billionaires are a problem as well.
“There is a reason why, over the years, the Democratic Party has not been as strong as it should be in standing up for the working class,” Sanders said.
Members of the crowd came from Missoula and from outside Montana, the early risers in line by 5 a.m.
They came to hear the message from the progressive politicians and star Montanans rallying people to push against a system they describe as broken for everyday workers and devastating the things they love.
They came because they are worried — about Social Security, human rights, due process for all people, federal workers, Medicare, education.
They came to be encouraged — to stay involved in politics and hear a message from Sanders, a politician some have admired for decades.

Sarah Willis said she’s a lesbian from Livingston who is “up to my ears” with Trump and his followers.
“I just want to feel good and inspired, like there’s some hope,” Willis said.
In November 2024, Trump won his second election for president, with 58.4% of the vote in Montana, a higher margin than he earned in 2020.
In a social media post Wednesday, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte reminded people voters had chosen Trump — and rejected his opponent and the vision of the visitors to Montana.
“Bernie Sanders and AOC are in Montana pushing their far–left agenda — but Montanans rejected them and their puppet Joe Biden after four years of failed policies,” Gianforte said.
“The people have spoken. They aren’t feeling the Bern.”
However, some Montanans have seen consequences they don’t like from the Trump administration.
Workers for the U.S. Forest Service have lost their jobs, the Montana Food Bank Network has lost money for food that goes to pantries across the state, and international students at the Montana University System recently lost visas.
Cammie Edgar of Stevensville said she’s worried about cuts to federal institutions including those earlier this month at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a National Institutes of Health research facility in Hamilton.
The facility lost two dozen employees earlier this month as part of a nationwide reduction intended to take the NIH down by 1,200 workers, according to the Ravalli Republic.
“That’s going to hit the Bitterroot Valley really hard,” said Edgar, who wore a T-shirt that read, “This is my living in unprecedented times shirt.”
Ahead of the keynote, Tracy Stone-Manning, former head of the Bureau of Land Management, warned the crowd of more to come, such as potential sales of public lands.

But Stone-Manning also said the country needs Montanans.
Stone-Manning, head of The Wilderness Society, said the organization turned 90 this year, founded by Bob Marshall, of the eponymous Bob Marshall Wilderness Area.
Marshall said the country needed “spirited people who will fight for the freedom of wilderness,” she said.
“Y’all know a thing or two about bringing spirit,” Stone Manning said.
She asked people to bring that spirit to fight for the Forest Service, the Park Service, the BLM, their favorite trailhead.
National parks brought Connie Sidebottom of Polson to the rally. Sidebottom wore a “Resist” button with Smokey Bear, and she said she’s worried about cuts to the places she loves.

“I want to resist because I love our national parks,” Sidebottom said.
She and her husband, Ralph, take their grandsons to a national park every year, and in 2010 or so, they saw a grizzly mama and cubs in Yellowstone National Park.
“We take our grandsons to parks so they love them like we do,” Connie Sidebottom said.
Ocasio-Cortez, a former waitress, said the crowd had gathered because people share a frustration and heartache that comes from watching those in power actively tear down the country and refuse to fight for everyday working Americans.
“We are watching as our neighbors, students and friends are being fired, targeted and disappeared,” said Ocasio-Cortez, of New York.
The possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028 said people who are LGBTQ+ are being harassed, immigrants are being taken off the streets by men in vans without uniforms, and educators are being fired for teaching American history accurately.
She said the Trump administration jailed a husband and father without evidence of a crime.

But Ocasio-Cortez said it will always be the people, the masses, who refuse to comply with authoritarian regimes, who will uphold democracy.
“Know that a better world is possible, and we are willing to do something about it,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
But she also said the political state of affairs didn’t come out of the blue. It has been a long time coming, she said, and it is tied directly to the growing and extreme wealth inequality building in America for years.
“Donald Trump is not an aberration,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “He is the logical conclusion of an American political system dominated by corporate and dark money.”
She told Montana that America is at a crossroads, and some members of the crowd saw the crossroads in their own lives.

John Moderie, of Missoula, said he hasn’t been politically active in the past.
But he’s on Social Security, and he’s worried about it, along with a multitude of other things.
“I don’t really lean left or right too much, but what’s going on woke me up, got me stirred up,” said Moderie, who wore a black leather vest with the American flag on the back. “So I’m political now.”
His brother, Mike Moderie, wore his “Fight Oligarchy” T-shirt over a Kamala Harris T-shirt written in UM-Grizzlies-maroon.
Harris, a Democrat, lost her presidential bid against Trump, but Moderie said he’s alarmed at the actions of the government, and he wants Republican representatives to impeach Trump.
He also said he wants people in the United States to follow Turkey’s lead in the ferocity of their political activism.
“They’re filling the streets up and pushing their leaders out,” Moderie said.
The crowd booed when the speakers mentioned members of Montana’s Republican Congressional delegation and Gianforte, a multimillionaire, and they cheered when Ocasio-Cortez said she knew Missoula had elected Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr to Montana’s Legislature.
One of the Montana speakers, Anne Hedges with the Montana Environmental Information Center, spoke to the wealth and power in the Treasure State, in times past and the current day.
She said Montanans are familiar with oligarchs of the past, the timber barons and the Copper Kings.
Now, she said, Montanans are beholden to NorthWestern Energy, a monopoly utility she said is fighting a healthy climate, recently raised rates 28%, and is asking for 26% more.
“Montana simply cannot afford these modern-day robber barons,” Hedges said.
Although the speakers railed against money in politics, their fight takes resources too.
A media contact for the Fighting Oligarchy event did not answer a question about the cost of the tours or sources of funds.
However, Sanders’ campaign committee listed on the Fighting Oligarchy website, Friends of Bernie Sanders, pulled in $11.5 million in the most recent quarter, of which $9.7 million came from donations of $200 or less, according to the most recent report filed with the Federal Elections Commission.
Ocasio-Cortez reminded the crowd that she pledged when she first ran for office that she would never take corporate donations, although an investigation by the Washington Examiner showed she has taken significant money from lobbyists representing powerful corporate clients.
But she also illustrated the influence of lobbyists in Washington, D.C., when she landed on the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce and said all of a sudden, her phone lines lit up with lobbyists who wanted to be her new best friend.
Ocasio-Cortez said the tour had recently drawn 12,000 people in red Idaho, 20,000 in Salt Lake City, and 36,000 in Los Angeles.
She said she learned on the way to Missoula that some House Republicans in districts where they’d held rallies wrote a letter warning Republican leadership: “We don’t know if we can vote for Medicaid cuts now.”

The politicians encouraged the crowd to run for office and stay involved, to hold their elected officials’ feet to the fire, and rallygoer Brittany Doctor said she always drags her significant other, Aaron Leek, to political debates and town halls.
Doctor and Leek drove from Walla Walla, Washington, for the event the night before, and they were second in line at 5 a.m. Wednesday.
Doctor said they’ve been disappointed that Republican Congressman Michael Baumgartner stopped doing town halls in their district.
But they both love Sanders and his message to the people.
“We’re taking every opportunity we can to, I guess, liberate ourselves,” Doctor said.
Allison Wilson, 24, said she works at the Poverello Center, a soup kitchen and shelter in Missoula, and she feels anxious about everything.
“I came to hear Bernie and AOC and to feel connected in the community, gain some hope out of it,” Wilson said.

Wilson said she’s seeing federal money dry up including dollars that go to local government and support housing programs.
“It just sucks that you can see a big storm coming,” Wilson said. “I know for sure I feel nervous.”
The Trump administration is making deep cuts to the federal government and its employees, and speakers and members of the crowd said the trend worried them.
Sam Forstag, a wildland firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service and union leader, told the crowd he has coworkers and friends “who’ve broken their backs and died in their boots making $15 an hour as a federal employee.”
“When I talk to my coworkers today, I hear a lot of people who are trying real hard just to hold onto hope because right now, the people who give their lives to public lands and public service are under attack,” said Forstag, who noted he was speaking personally and not in an official capacity.
Joan Egan, 80, said in the place she lives, many residents exist on Social Security, “and they’re very frightened.”
She said the nation is rapidly descending into an oligarchy, and she was hoping to help gird it against the slide.
“We’re here to try to save our nation,” Egan said.

On a 97-0 vote, the House amended, then passed Senate Bill 5263 on Wednesday to put Washington, for the first time, on a course to fully fund special education in its public schools.
It also adjusted two other funding levers in the bill to drive more dollars for special education to the state’s 295 school districts. All told, roughly $870 million more will be sent out over the next two budgets. That sum is a compromise with the Senate, which wanted to spend closer to $2 billion. 
Rep. Gerry Pollet, D-Seattle, who called the cap “unconscionable and maybe unconstitutional,” said its elimination is “a historic achievement.” It commits the state to amply fund the education of every child with a disability, he said.
Ditching the cap “is the very first step to saying we’re going to fully fund special education. This is going to absolutely help our schools,” said Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, who has three children with individualized education plans, or IEPs — plans developed for every public school student who needs special education services.
“It represents something we should all be proud of,” he said. Couture urged his colleagues to guard against any weakening of the legislation in the final stages of budget talks. 
Also Wednesday, the House passed a Senate bill to send additional dollars to districts to cover materials, supplies and operating costs — MSOC in state budget lingo. These costs, which cover non-employee-related expenses tied to a district’s daily operations, have surged in recent years.
“This is a bill that will literally keep the lights on in schools,” said Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, a former school board member.
The House amended, then passed Senate Bill 5192 on an 85-12 vote. It would boost the amount of state funding per student for MSOC to $1,614, an increase of $35. An additional $214.94 is provided for each high school student. That’s four dollars more than the current rate.
Couture opposed this legislation, saying it’s too small an increase to help the most needy districts.
“I don’t think an extra $35 will keep the lights on,” he said.
Cap would be removed
Special education is the area where the gap is largest between what districts receive from the state and what they pay for with local dollars. 
In the 2022-23 school year, districts spent $590 million of local levy receipts to make up the difference, according to a performance audit issued in January by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee.
Washington uses two key mechanisms for determining what a district receives.
First, there is the cap on the percentage of a school district’s student population that can receive extra dollars for special education services. 
Under current law, the state only provides additional funding for up to 16% of a district’s student population. In other words, if 20% of a district’s population requires special education services, the district cannot get additional money for the remaining 4%.
Second, the state distributes an amount of money for each student enrolled in a school, plus additional dollars for each special education student under a formula known as the multiplier.
Senate Bill 5263 removes the enrollment cap and increases the multiplier to send more dollars to districts. 
It also simplifies the formula used by the state to determine how much will be provided per student. And it makes it easier for districts to qualify for additional special education dollars through a safety net program run by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, are the bill’s co-sponsors.
Pedersen, prior to the Senate vote, acknowledged the state’s tight budget situation this year but said Washington’s Constitution “is very clear that funding basic education is our paramount duty.”
“The fact that it is expensive doesn’t change that on the ground we’ve got kids with special needs who are in our charge and are relying on us to make sure that they get the education to which they’re entitled,” he said.
Initially, the House upped the multiplier and safety net but left the enrollment cap in place. 
Pollet continued to press for the cap’s erasure as he has for the past 13 years. This time he prevailed. Changes made Wednesday will pump out $870 million to districts, he said.
If House Bill 2049 passes, it will be more, he said. 
That bill would allow an increase in annual property tax growth from the current 1% cap to the combined rate of population growth plus inflation within a taxing district, not to exceed 3%. This would apply to the state’s property tax, also known as the common schools levy.
The bill would also make other changes that could help districts receive more taxpayer dollars.
A fiscal analysis estimates that uncapping the state property tax would bring in an additional $200 million in the next biennium and $618 million in the 2027-29 budget. School districts collectively could raise another $900 million locally over four years. The legislation is slated to be voted on Friday in the House Finance Committee.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/classroom-students-raising-hands.jpg,,,2025-04-16 21:01:04.060001

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Two furloughed employees with the U.S. Department of Education warned Colorado lawmakers on Wednesday that a reduced workforce in the department could result in delayed or incorrectly disbursed grant money to the state.
The Colorado Department of Education receives about $870 million from the federal government, or a little over 11% of its money, according to Commissioner of Education Susana Córdova.
“The funding that we receive through all of these different funding sources are supplemental funds that really are essential to services, particularly for the most vulnerable students,” she said during a special Senate Education Committee hearing.

That money comes from grant allocations doled out by program, ranging from about $206 million for special education and services for students with disabilities to about $371,000 for students in juvenile detention centers or other alternative education settings. Other programs support students in poverty, students learning English and out-of-school enrichment programs.
Since 2010, the money has spread across over 100 grant programs for a total of over $20 billion.
But two recently-furloughed employees from the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education said that the slashed workforce directed by the Trump administration could endanger efficient data processing and ultimately disturb the timeline and accuracy of funding disbursements.
“The office’s day-to-day operations are guided by a grant making life cycle, which includes pre-award, award and post-award activities. It is not as simple as writing a check,” said Sarah Newman, who helped lead the office’s data management team.
The work includes publicizing grant opportunities, assessing grantee risk, calculating funding using formulas, ensuring compliance and providing technical assistance. All of that relies on data processed and maintained by Newman’s team. They looked for anomalies and errors that would affect funding.
Since President Donald Trump ordered the drastic reduction of the department in March, about 90% of the OESE workforce has been fired or left, Newman said. Trump has repeatedly called for the closure of the Department of Education, which he does not have the power to do as president, but he can severely reduce its capacity.
“Since January 20, the current administration has taken numerous actions that have threatened the operations of (the Education Department), as well as the sustainability of the funding and services Colorado currently receives,” Newman said. “I stand before you today concerned that, beginning with this next fiscal year, the federal funds Colorado schools have come to rely on will not be there.”
It could also impact the current round of funding. Even though data was submitted and sent to the programs, people on the team were fired before the standard correction period ended.
“I worry that the decisions made to distribute the grants on July 1 are based on preliminary data, which the states did not have an opportunity to correct or explain. I also have concerns about the program’s ability to do all the work required just to make the awards in time,” said data analyst Joe Murphy.
Murphy and Newman emphasized that delayed, repurposed or eliminated funding would have the biggest impact on school districts in poor and rural areas. Littleton Public Schools, for example, gets about 5% of its funding from the federal government, but Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, which misses out on property tax revenue because of its proximity to an Army base, gets 30% of its funding from federal sources.
Newman and Murphy suggested that state lawmakers try to use historical funding data and codify at the state level the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, which is the country’s main education law. The law includes the federal programs related to low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities, English Learners and other historically marginalized students.
Murphy worries that the federal government will resort to giving block grants to states, rather than divided up by program. That switch would require a change in federal law.
“You can look at what’s in ESSA and say, ‘These are the funds, and this is where they’re supposed to go’ and carry that out at the state level,” Murphy said.
The state’s legislative session ends the first week of May, so such a large policy undertaking could be near-impossible this year.
Córdova, the education commissioner, told lawmakers that she is hopeful that “verbal commitments” to maintain program funding for low-income students and students with disabilities will stick.
“What we’ve heard from the new secretary of Education is a commitment to continue funding,” she said. “We’re very hopeful that that would be the case, because I think absent that funding, very important and critical services would be missing for students who rely on them.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A $15 million obligation to cover deficits in the Providence Public School District (PPSD) may have come under duress for Mayor Brett Smiley last fall, but he posed it as a win in his fiscal 2026 budget address Wednesday at City Hall.
“This budget includes the largest investment in our schools since at least 2006, making up for a generation of underfunding of our educational system in one fiscal year,” Smiley said in unveiling his $624.1 million spending plan.
But he said the city needs $25 million in new revenue to satisfy all the terms of the November settlement with the Rhode Island Department of Education, which has controlled Providence’s public schools since 2019. The proposed budget represents a roughly 4% increase in spending over the current fiscal year that ends June 30. 
The city is relying on a $29 million increase in its tax levy to support the proposed budget, with $23 million coming from new revenue sources. One of the primary mechanisms for getting that revenue, however, depends on authorization from the General Assembly allowing the city to raise its tax revenue above the 4% state cap for the next fiscal year. 
Smiley’s proposed budget assumes the city will acquire the state approval needed to raise its tax levy, or total collected tax revenue, by 7.5%. The mayor’s spending plan has actually lowered tax rates for all types of properties, but recent, state-mandated reassessments of home values in Providence mean that, even with the lower tax rates, the city would still go beyond the levy.
That’s why Smiley is waiting on state approval of a city-sponsored tax levy bill. An initial version of the bill stalled in March as Providence lawmakers  held off to allow the Providence City Council to make recommendations. On April 2, Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak introduced the current iteration, which has yet to be scheduled for a committee hearing. 
Companion Senate legislation, meanwhile, has yet to be introduced. Sponsor Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, said he intends to introduce the bill once the state legislature resumes next week.  
Kislak said via text Wednesday that maneuvering the bill through the State House has been difficult because state reps haven’t had all the needed facts.
“Where the mayor and city council (unanimously) are in agreement, I think the state should give them reasonable leeway to exceed the levy cap,” Kislak wrote. “And once we see the budget we can have concrete conversations about the policy (and levy cap) which until tonight were hard to have. We didn’t have any way to talk about what the cost would be to Providence homeowners.”
If the levy hike failed, Smiley’s budget would return to the City Council, which would need to cut and pivot accordingly to keep it under the existing cap. Should that happen, Kislak noted that the State House can help in other ways, and that proposed legislation relating to parking lot and Airbnb taxes could help plug the gaps. 
Speaking to reporters after his speech, Smiley said he’s still “confident that the General Assembly would pass our request for a one-time exception to the cap. Were that not to pass, we’d be back to the drawing board, and we’re going to have to make very serious cuts. But I don’t think anyone wants to do that, and I think especially now that the actual tax rates are out, and instead of talking in the abstract, we’re talking about specifics.”
Balancing act
This year’s spending plan would have been actually $9 million less than last year, if not for the settlement payment, Smiley said in his speech. 
“We think we found that right balance,” Smiley told reporters after his speech. “At least $9 million worth of cuts is exceptional. That never happens in city government.”
The tightrope act was so successful, Smiley said, that the tax increase “we feared was necessary” became “the lowest responsible rate,” the mayor said.
The increase is a little more complicated underneath the hood: The city actually had to adjust and lower the ratios between different kinds of tax rates to comply with state laws. But, Smiley noted in his speech, “Many people’s homes may be worth significantly more than they were 10 years ago,” and for fiscal year 2026, some types of properties in Providence saw their value jump over 30% or 40%. Adjusting the ratio tax rates cushioned the increase to individual tax bills while increasing the levy overall.   
After adjusting for the lowered tax rates and increased property value, the proposed rates are:

4% for single-family homes. The average value went up 31% to $551,881. The average tax bill would go up $161, from $4,392 to $4,553. 
16% for owner-occupied homes with two to five families. The average value increased 47% to $585,027. The average tax bill would go up $650, from $4,176 to $4,826. 
4%  for owner-occupied condos. The average value rose 32% to $507,713. The average tax bill would go up $166, from $4,023 to $4,189. 
5% for single-Family Homes, non-owner-occupied. The average value went up 33% to $445,385. The average tax bill would go up $287, from $6,127 to $6,414. 
16% for non-owner-occupied homes with two to five families. The average value went up 48% to $606,365. The average tax bill would go up $1,197, from $7,534 to $8,732.

-1% for buildings with 11 or more units. The average value went up 28% to $4,832,121. The average tax bill would go up $1,699, from $132,392 to $134,091. 
-2% for commercial Properties. The average value went up 20% to $855,368. The average tax bill would go down $401, from $25,035 to $24,635.

In the meantime, Smiley didn’t want to put the onus of this debt entirely on the city’s residents. About 96% of the city’s costs are fixed year over year, and the remaining 4% is more flexible. City accountants exercised their cleverness to reduce spending without pilfering too much from residents’ pocketbooks. 
“There’s only three ways to balance this budget,” Smiley said. “Either we raise property taxes, we find other revenues, or we make cuts. The budget that I propose tonight does all three things, and it tries to do all three things and strike the right balance.”










We think we found that right balance. At least $9 million worth of cuts is exceptional. That never happens in city government.


–  Providence Mayor Brett Smiley


Property tax exemptions for people over age 65 and veterans would see 25% and 100% increases, respectively, to mitigate the tax hikes.  
The city expects to cut 23 positions, many of them vacant. Only two would require layoffs, and both are nonunion, city officials said. Cost of living adjustments will be paused for nonunion employees making over $100,000. A $3.2 million savings in public safety overtime, meanwhile, is largely possible because of increased staffing in the municipal fire department.
There’s also a $2.8 million cut in services, but these do not represent an elimination of resident-facing programs, officials said. Residents would not see reductions in direct services like trash pickup — an earlier idea to pick up garbage every other week has been nixed, for instance. The 8% reduction in services in the mayor’s spending plan, city officials said, involves more cuts to internal purchases or contracts within city departments.
Alas, life in the city will not go untouched. Take the shiny new parking kiosks Smiley mentioned in his budget address last year, which could now be bearers of bad news for drivers who forget to feed the meter.
A number of fees and fines could eke up. Among the fee changes:

The fine for “overtime parking” from 2 to 5 a.m. would go from $20 to $50.
Parking at an expired meter would rise from $25 to $40.
Parking in a prohibited area would rise $30 to $50.
Parking in an emergency zone would rise from $100 to $250, although the city is considering raising the cost only for nonresidents.

The budget is available on the city’s website. City Council committee meetings will see the budget inspected and reviewed, and council members have the power to edit line items. The final budget will emerge in June.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)House Democrats think their most likely strategy to prevent major cuts to Medicaid or other popular federal programs in the current budget reconciliation process will be to win over a few House Republicans.
“We just need three Republicans, basically nationwide, to say no to something,” said U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth) at a Q-and-A session with reporters Wednesday in his Madison office.
The Republican majorities in both houses of Congress are using the complicated budget reconciliation process to pass a spending plan that will allow them to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during President Donald Trump’s first term.
As part of that, House Republicans passed a blueprint calling for $880 billion in cuts to programs overseen by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Medicaid represents the largest expense item in the committee’s purview, and analysts have said Congress could only hit that target by making Medicaid cuts.
Pocan said estimates of the cost of preserving the tax cuts have risen in Washington, from $4.5 trillion in the original House proposal to “more like $7 trillion in tax cuts” in the current proposal combined from House and Senate alternatives.
The objective for House Democrats currently is to make cuts to Medicaid harder for GOP members to go along with, Pocan said. In Wisconsin, about 1.3 million residents are enrolled in Medicaid, including one third of the children in the state and 55% of seniors in nursing homes.
“You know, the more they hear that, at some point they may listen,” Pocan said of Republican members who won swing districts by narrow margins — and, he argues, they could push back against those sorts of cuts.
“I don’t expect them to maybe say it publicly and maybe to hold a town hall and say it, but if they say it privately in their caucus, that’s good enough, as long as three people won’t support something,” Pocan said. “That’s enough to kill something, right? So that’s kind of my goal is to keep facilitating that.”
The focus, though, is not on stopping the tax cuts, but stopping the cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other federal programs.
“If we could stop that, and we could stop, maybe, some of the education cuts that might otherwise come … funds for low-income [districts], funds for special ed, I think they’re still going to move forward with their tax cut bill,” Pocan said.
He speculated that under those circumstances, the GOP majority would pay for the tax cut with a deficit increase. 
“Is that a good answer? No,” Pocan said. “But is it better than seeing people lose their health care right now or their food assistance through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program? Yeah. So you know my job is to wake up in the morning and get excited about bad choices rather than the worst choices.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa is an outlier for the wrong reasons, according to several environmental advocates who spoke at the Harkin Institute’s annual wellness symposium, which this year focused on the future of clean water. 
Speakers at the symposium noted Iowa’s cancer rates, which are the second-highest in the nation, the state’s overwhelming amounts of animal manure and its problems with polluted water. 
This was the setup to launch an initiative between the Iowa Environmental Council and the Harkin Institute to explore the relationship between environmental risk factors and cancer rates in Iowa. 
“At its heart, this entire initiative is about each out you, and about Iowans,” Sarah Green, IEC’s executive director said.

The initiative will combine both community outreach and a “rigorous” review of academic research on the subject. 
The review will result in a public report and journal article with visual data mapping to show environmental risks and cancer rates. The two organizations aim to share these reports widely across the state and hold 15 listening tours to hear and amplify Iowan’s lived experiences with cancer. 
“Our goal is to give voice to Iowans — whether they’re urban or rural — give them a voice, give them the opportunity to share and document their story,” Green said. 
  A project that will explore the relationship between the environment and cancer rates in Iowa, was launched at the Harkin On Wellness symposium at Drake University. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Green said it’s now “well established” that certain factors, like tobacco use, tanning beds and alcohol consumption contribute to cancer rates, but she questioned “what else might be at play.” 
Cancer research was a priority outlined in Gov. Kim Reynold’s Condition of the State address earlier this year, when she called on the Legislature to fund a $1 million partnership between the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Iowa to research factors contributing to Iowa cancer cases.
Adam Shriver, the director of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute, said the partnership between Harkin and IEC would “address the gaps” in the conversations about cancer in the state.
“Part of what’s motivating our project is that even though there are lots of groups talking about studying the high cancer rates, there are some groups that want to limit what we’re looking at when we’re having these conversations” Shriver said. 
Future of clean water
The Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement, based at Drake University aims to facilitate public policy research and citizen engagement. Previous iterations of the Harkin On Wellness symposium have centered on topics like well-being in schools and healthy food. 
Sue Mattison, Drake University’s provost, said the 2025 topic, the future of clean water, touches “every community, every discipline and every life.” 
Mattison, who is also an epidemiologist, said she has seen “firsthand” the impact environmental factors, like water quality, can have on health outcomes. 
“We know that climate change, population growth, pollution and the burden of inequitable environmental infrastructure are putting immense pressure on our water systems, and it’s clear that no single sector can change these challenges alone,” Mattison said in her opening comments at the symposium. “The problems we face require collaboration across every sector.” 
The event featured speakers across disciplines who discussed the need for cleaner water through the lenses of cancer research, environmental ligation, public policy, community action and even art, with a satirical video listing the ingredients in Iowa’s “pure” drinking water. 
Speakers identified industrial agriculture practices, like the over-application of nutrients to cropland, and runoff from confined animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, as key polluters to Iowa’s water. 
The most mentioned pollutant, nitrate, enters streams from manure, fertilizer, septic and sewage runoff. On its own, nitrate is not a carcinogen, but when ingested, it interacts with other compounds that can be carcinogenic, according to the National Cancer Institute. 
Excessive consumption of nitrate can also cause health issues like blue baby syndrome, thyroid problems and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Citizen scientists take to Iowa’s waters to monitor nitrate levels

Lu Liu, an assistant professor at Iowa State University, said only 4% of public water systems in Iowa treat drinking water for nitrates, according to a recent study. 
The study “Disparities in potential exposures to elevated nitrate in Iowa’s Public Water Systems” was published in February and found that more than 7% of Iowa’s average population are exposed to drinking water with nitrate levels in excess of 5 milligrams per liter. This metric is half of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s limit on nitrate in drinking water, but Liu said existing research of exposure at the 5 mg/L level has demonstrated negative health outcomes.
Jim Larew, an attorney with the northeastern Iowa environmental group Driftless Water Defenders, said he has seen the reputation of Iowa change over the years from a state with high education rates and healthy citizens, to the state with some of the highest rates of cancer in the country. 
Larew, who has litigated against issues like the renewal of a water use permit for a CAFO at the head waters of a trout stream, said it would be a “misstatement” to blame all of the cancer in the state on industrial agriculture.
“But surely, when you look at the maps and incidences of cancer and where we’re doing the most intensive farming, there’s at least an association,” Larew said. 
He said environmental work, to him, is also a social movement that is on the “cusp of a civil rights movement” in Iowa. 
“This is not something that just involves lawyers and judges — if we’re going to move things in the right direction — it requires people,” Larew said.

HB 476, sponsored by Rep. Marilyn Lands, D-Huntsville, would require the manufacturers of technology devices and software providers to provide information, tools and parts for items they produce to consumers and repair shops.
“It would reduce consumer cost and have significant environmental and economic benefits,” Lands told the committee prior to the public hearing. “It promotes affordability, sustainability and access to critical supplies.”

The bill states that an original equipment manufacturer will not impose contractual limitations on access to documents that outline how to repair the items they make.
Manufacturers will also ensure that parts are available to repair their devices for at least five years after the discontinue making the item and that the parts are offered on “fair and reasonable” terms without requiring consumers or repair shops to buy additional services from them.
It also makes manufacturers subject to a $10,000 fine for not complying with the provisions in the bill and allows consumers and repair shops to file lawsuits against manufacturers for violating elements of the bill.
Members of the public spoke both in favor of and against the legislation.
“It is wonderful for our environment to keep appliances going for longer rather than throwing them into landfills, particularly with the sort of toxic components that are often involved in e-waste,” said Tabitha Isner, who spoke in favor of the legislation. “It is also great for the economy to have folks who are able to make a small business out of repairing electronics.”
Dustin Brighton, director Repair Done Right Coalition, an organization that advocates for the safe and secure repair of electronic devices opposed the bill, saying that it would lead to safety risk and threats for Alabama residents.
“Mandating that companies outsource their repair service to a third-party network prevents them from being able to fully stand behind their products’ safety and security,” he said.
The committee plans to vote on the legislation next week.

Shapiro and his family. It is being investigated as arson. (Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Gov. Josh Shapiro flatly condemned political violence without commenting on the motives of the man accused of firebombing his official residence, after court documents revealed 38-year-old Cody Balmer made a reference to Palestine in a call to authorities after the attack.
“I know there are people out there who want to adopt their own political viewpoints or their own world views to what happened and why. I choose not to participate in that,” Shapiro told reporters Wednesday during a stop in Derry Township, Dauphin County. He and his family were awakened during the attack about 2 a.m. Sunday by a state trooper assigned to his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
Shapiro noted he had similarly avoided speculation after the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in July and the arrest in Altoona of the man charged with shooting and killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.
“This kind of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it,” Shapiro said. “This level of violence has to end, and it has to be roundly condemned by everyone, both political parties, people from all different walks of life.”

In an interview Tuesday on WILK-AM in Wilkes-Barre, U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) expressed sympathy for Shapiro and his family, but was critical of Shapiro’s opposition to the Trump administration. He suggested that it was contributing to political tension, adding, “They got to tone it down.”
“I mean, every action Josh Shapiro has taken against the president has either been a lawsuit or a falsehood,” Meuser claimed in the interview.
Apparently surprised by a reporter’s summation of Meuser’s remarks, Shapiro said elected leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity. “It would appear that the congressman failed to measure up to that,” Shapiro said.
Members of Pennsylvania Islamic organizations condemned the attack but also expressed worry that Balmer’s statements could intensify Islamophobia across the nation.
Court officials released search warrants Wednesday for Balmer’s home, a storage locker and for a sample of his DNA that provided new information about his actions after the attack on the Governor’s Residence around 2 a.m. Sunday morning.

Balmer is charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses. A Dauphin County district judge ordered him held without bail during his arraignment Monday. Relatives of Balmer told CBS news and the Associated Press that he had struggled with mental illness and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been treated in a psychiatric hospital twice. 
Police allege Balmer scaled a fence to enter the grounds, broke two windows and used Molotov cocktails to set fire to public areas of the residence including the state dining room where Shapiro had hosted Passover Seder with family and guests hours earlier. They said Balmer admitted that he hated Shapiro in an interview with investigators after his arrest.
Shapiro, who is Jewish, has drawn criticism for his support of Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,200 Israelis. It centered on his remarks labeling pro-Palestine protests against Jewish-owned businesses antisemitic and urging the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions to quell campus protests.
After fleeing the Governor’s Residence, Balmer called 911 and told a dispatcher his name, stating Shapiro needed to know Balmer “… will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
Balmer also said in the 911 call Shapiro needs to stop having Balmer’s friends killed and “our people have been put through too much by that monster,” according to the search warrants. He concluded the call by telling the dispatcher “all [Shapiro] has is a banquet hall to clean up,” police know where to find him, and that he would confess “to everything that I had done.”
The warrant concluded Balmer’s remarks demonstrate his political motives and requested court approval to seize electronic devices and writings that mention Shapiro, Israel, Palestine or Gaza.

Shapiro said it was for prosecutors to determine what motivated the attack, and referred further questions to the Dauphin County district attorney’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice. A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney John Gurganus said he had no comment Wednesday.
Under Pennsylvania law. ethnic intimidation is an offense that can be added to enhance another offense such as aggravated assault by increasing the possible penalties.
More than two dozen mosques and Islamic community organizations across the statehave signed a letter expressing shock and outrage about the attack and condemning violence. The letter says the group’s members pray for Shapiro and his family’s safety and noted that Shapiro and previous governors have opened the official residence to leaders of diverse faiths.
“The horrifying images of the damage inflicted upon this historic space have shaken our community and reinforced our concern that the rising tide of hateful rhetoric and the current political climate pose a grave threat to our shared vision of a peaceful, inclusive Pennsylvania,” the letter says.
Ahmet Tekelioglu, executive director of the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the acts Balmer is accused of are not those of the pro-Palistine movement. 
“It’s important to note the pro-Palistine movement in the United States has followed the tradition in American democracy of nonviolent protest,” Tekelioglu said, adding that while CAIR has disagreed with some of Shapiro’s statements, “We don’t think that this is, in a real democracy, how things get resolved.”
Tekelioglu said CAIR Philadelphia has provided Mosques, schools and community centers with additional guidance on security and increased communication with law enforcement.
“There’s already a heightened sense of risk given the current administration’s attacks on our communities,” he said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a $6.2 billion draft state operating budget, putting Alaska on track for a significant deficit in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
If Wednesday’s draft is added to a capital budget draft passed Tuesday by the Senate and a planned supplemental budget needed to fix a deficit in the current fiscal year, total general-purpose spending is near $6.6 billion. 
Meanwhile, the Alaska Department of Revenue expects $6.1 billion in general-purpose revenue during the upcoming fiscal year. The House is proposing to spend from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s main savings account, to balance the budget.
“This is the best our body can do right now,” said House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage.
Kopp went on to say that the House-passed budget is preliminary and subject to change by the Senate.
An earlier version of the House budget included $2.5 billion for the 2025 Permanent Fund dividend, enough to pay almost $3,900 to every recipient. To reduce the size of the expected deficit, the House voted to cut PFD spending to $950 million, a payout of about $1,400 per recipient.
“Some may argue that we should cut the fat. What fat is there? We are at the bone,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee.

The one major increase in the budget is an $86 million increase to K-12 public school funding, equivalent to a one-time $1,000 increase to the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula. 
Last year, lawmakers approved a one-time $680 increase to the BSA. 
“I want to celebrate today … this is a pro-growth budget that puts our state on a path toward prosperity,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage.
Wednesday’s vote fell along caucus lines, as all 21 members of the House’s coalition majority — 2 Republicans, 5 independents and 14 Democrats — voted in favor of the budget draft. 
All 19 members of the House’s Republican minority voted against it, with some citing the deficit.
“This budget is a bunch of lofty promises. That’s what’s so heartbreaking about it, because everybody here knows they will not be kept,” said Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer and a member of the minority.

Vance and other members of the minority said the budget is unsustainable because it relies on spending from savings. Even if the CBR — which contains $2.8 billion — is sufficient to cover this year’s deficit, it may not be enough to cover next year’s projected gap, which is expected to be worse.
“This budget makes promises it can’t keep,” said Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer and a member of the minority.
“It will probably be the other body that takes on the responsibility that we have given up,” she said, referring to the Senate.
Senate leaders have said throughout the session that their aim is to pass a budget without drawing from savings.
“We’ve got to balance the budget without a CBR draw for this year and prepare for next year,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a Tuesday news conference with reporters.
Over the next fiscal year, the Alaska Department of Revenue expects North Slope oil prices to average $68 per barrel. That’s significantly lower than the current year and would reduce the amount of revenue available to the state.
“To the fundamental core question: Can the Senate balance the budget at $68? The answer is yes. Is it going to be fun, without any difficult decisions? No,” Stedman said.
Asked where the Senate’s cuts will be, Stedman said that remains to be determined.
“Everything’s in play,” he said.

(Photo by Adam Gault/Getty Images)As a board-certified family and lifestyle medicine physician in Salt Lake City, I laud both the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency for separately announcing initiatives last week to start backing off of animal testing.
In a news release on April 10, the FDA said it plans to phase out animal testing in the development of monoclonal antibody therapies and other drugs with more effective, human-relevant methods. “The new approach,” the agency said, “is designed to improve drug safety and accelerate the evaluation process, while reducing animal experimentation, lowering research and development (R&D) costs, and ultimately, drug prices.” Separately, EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou told the Washington Examiner in a statement on Thursday the EPA “is wholly committed to getting the agency back on track to eliminating animal testing.”
As a former NASA engineer turned physician, I have the highest regard for evidence-backed decision making. The move by these two federal agencies to minimize animal testing in favor of human-focused models makes perfect scientific sense and ultimately will benefit patients by getting new pharmaceuticals and therapies to the market sooner and in a more cost-effective manner.
Animal testing is outdated. It is tedious, expensive and oftentimes produces data that doesn’t translate to human health. Experimental methods that don’t use animals, like tissue chips and computational models, lead to the development of safer and more effective therapies and pharmaceuticals.
In addition to benefits to human health, human-centric research approaches save animal lives and prevent their suffering.
My perspective is not unique.
A recent survey shows the vast majority of Americans are in favor of phasing out animal experiments.
A September 2024 Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine/Morning Consult poll of more than 2,000 asked for agreement levels to the statement “The US government should commit to a plan to phase out experiments on animals.” Eighty percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed. This represents a shift from a 2018 Pew Research Center study that found that 47% of Americans were in favor of using animals in scientific research labs and 52% opposed it.
In my lifestyle medicine practice, I work with patients to prevent and reverse chronic disease through diet, movement, and stress management. Often, my patients are able to come off of medications. But when pharmaceuticals are needed, I want to ensure they’re safe, effective, and fairly priced. To those points, the federal government’s recent moves to begin phasing out animal testing is a big step in the right direction.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-95011864-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-04-16 20:07:54.926289

“I want to make sure that we’re fully funding our obligation to public schools before we start spending 10s of millions of general revenue dollars on private schools,” Hough told reporters after making the cut.
In his State of the State speech to lawmakers in January, Kehoe said he was not funding the foundation formula to the level directed by state law because it no longer fairly distributes the money. The extra money for the scholarship program, he said, would give parents more educational choices.
Public schools come first, Hough said Wednesday.
Kehoe “admitted we’re not funding K-12 to the level that it’s supposed to be funded.” Hough said. “And I think that’s an obligation that we have, especially when we have the money in the bank.”
Missouri has a healthy general revenue surplus, with $3.7 billion in the fund on March 31. There is another $1.5 billion that, like general revenue, is unrestricted. But revenue is declining in the current fiscal year and, while modest growth is projected for the future, the budget being prepared now will use at least $1.6 billion from the surplus.
The budget is based on a projection of $13.6 billion in general revenue. Kehoe proposed spending almost $16 billion, including construction and maintenance funding, and the House budget plan uses $15.2 billion.
The exact totals for the 13 budget bills funding state operations approved by the committee were not available Wednesday. But with the extra money for public schools, plus $107 million for child care subsidies and dozens of new earmarks, the total is sure to be substantially higher than the $47.9 billion from all funds approved in the House and could exceed the $50.1 billion total in Kehoe’s proposal.
Three more bills spending another $3.7 billion for construction and maintenance are awaiting a final House vote before the Senate committee can make its changes.
The greatest uncertainty for the upcoming year is whether substantial cuts will be made to federal spending. The largest single shared program is Medicaid, with Missouri paying 10- to 35% of the cost for each person enrolled and the federal treasury covering the rest.
The group made eligible by a 2020 constitutional amendment costs the state the least, only 10% of the expense. So far, Missouri has not spent any general revenue on the expanded group, using other sources of money, including federal aid banked during the COVID pandemic.
If Missouri were required to pay 20% of the cost, it would have to find $300 million to keep it in place for the 350,000 enrollees.
Hough has been warning that federal cuts could upset Missouri’s budget. But on Wednesday, he said the committee can only write a budget based on what is currently in place.
“To the extent that we can, we plan for this kind of stuff,” Hough said. “But how do you plan for a Medicaid reimbursement on an expanded population that goes down by, say, say, 20% and costs us $600 million?”
The $50 million cut to the scholarship line was the largest cut of the day but not the only one. The Senate committee took out $10 million the House included to hire an architect to prepare plans for expanding the Capitol. Another set of cuts targeted some of the earmarked items approved in the House.
And cuts were used to express lingering resentment for the factionalism that fractured Republicans in the state Senate for four years. State Sen. Mike Cierpiot of Lee’s Summit cut 25 employees and $684,000 from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ budget, noting that the positions had been open for a long time and the office seems to function acceptably without them.
Hoskins was a member of the Freedom Caucus, which repeatedly tied the Senate up in filibusters to push its brand of Republicanism. And as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he argued often against retaining employee authorizations that departments were unable to fill within six to 12 months.
Hoskins, inaugurated in January, is authorized to employ 267 full time staff. During the fiscal year that ended June 30, his predecessor, Jay Ashcroft, used 205 of that amount.
Hoskins said he needs to study each position in his to determine if it is needed if the cut is made. 
“I will comply with whatever they do,” he said.
Hough said he had no objections to cutting the unfilled positions. 
“Sen. Hoskins, when he was on this committee with us,” Hough said, “was always kind of a hawk on that stuff.”

John Payton, R-Wilburn, present a proposed constitutional amendment to affirm Arkansans' right to keep and bear arms to the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs on Monday, April 14, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Three proposed constitutional amendments are expected to appear on Arkansas voters’ 2026 ballots after receiving legislative approval this week.
The House and Senate approved three Republican-led measures and sent them to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk:

A proposal to affirm that the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “is a natural, fundamental, and individual right that shall not be infringed.”
A proposal to allow the Legislature to create economic development districts throughout the state
The Citizens Only Voting Amendment, to affirm that only U.S. citizens can vote in Arkansas, which is already the law

All three proposals received approval from the House and Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs before each chamber voted on them.
The Legislature is allowed to refer a maximum of three amendments to voters during every regular session. Lawmakers referred only one measure to the 2024 ballot, a proposal for trade-school students to be eligible for scholarship lottery funds, which voters overwhelmingly approved in November.
The proposal pertaining to gun rights would alter the portion of the Arkansas Constitution that echoes the federal Second Amendment. The concise language of the amendment would clarify that the right to keep and bear arms extends to “the possession and use of” ammunition, firearm accessories and firearm components.
The proposed amendment did not generate discussion on the Senate floor last week or on the House floor Tuesday. House sponsor Rep. Matt Duffield, R-Russellville, gave an eight-minute speech encouraging his colleagues to support the measure.
“At the end of the day, the Second Amendment and our own right to keep and bear arms in the Arkansas Constitution is not about hunting, it’s not about sport-shooting and it’s not about self-protection,” Duffield said Tuesday. “It’s about a citizen’s last line of defense against tyranny, and it’s part of our nation’s DNA.”

Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, was the Senate sponsor of the amendments pertaining to firearms and noncitizen voting. Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, sponsored the Citizens Only Voting Amendment and told the House on April 7 that language in state constitutions that say “every citizen” or “any citizen” can vote is “a floor rather than a ceiling.”
“[Existing language] protects your right and my right as a citizen, but it’s insufficient because it leaves room for other people to be added to that list,” Ray said.
Noncitizen voting is already illegal in federal elections. Noncitizen voting in local elections is rare nationwide, but it has been legalized in a handful of cities, leading to backlash from conservatives.
House Bill 1422, another proposed measure to further ensure citizens do not vote in Arkansas, failed in the House in March. The bill needed 67 House votes because part of it would have amended the state Constitution, and 53 Republicans supported the bill while 14 more did not vote.
Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen, D-Springdale, expressed opposition to both the bill that failed and the proposed amendment that passed. She told her colleagues both times that noncitizens do not attempt to vote because it would cost them their path to U.S. citizenship.
Thirteen states — including Louisiana, Oklahoma and Missouri — have amended their constitutions since 2020 to specify that noncitizens cannot vote in those states.
The amendments pertaining to noncitizen voting and gun rights passed the House and Senate mostly along party lines, while the economic development amendment had bipartisan support in both chambers.
This proposed amendment defines an economic development district as “a designated area within a city, county, or cooperative area established under authority granted by the General Assembly to promote economic development.” Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, introduced the measure in the Senate.

“What we’re trying to do is level the playing field with our neighboring states,” House sponsor Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, told his colleagues Wednesday. “…It’s going to allow direct local incentives to be made, potentially for retail, for housing, to clean up blight in your communities, and it’s going to have the ability for local control, where your local communities can decide what’s important to them.”
The proposed amendment generated 45 minutes of debate on the House floor. Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, said she disliked that the proposal says “loans and grants of public money” will support economic development projects.
“The taxpayer is who this will roll down the hill upon if it should fail,” Lundstrum said. “I think this particular idea needs more vetting and more time.”
Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, expressed support for the measure.
“You come through Texarkana, you cross that state line and you see the economic development that happens in Texas,” Dalby said. “It’s not for lack of trying [in] Texarkana, Arkansas or Miller County, Arkansas. I guarantee you we fight constantly to get things into our district, and here’s what we hear all the time: ‘I can go across the state line and I can get a better deal.”
Proposed constitutional amendments require a simple majority of voter approval to go into effect. All three amendments would be effective Jan. 1, 2027 if approved.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duffield_Payton-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)This story originally appeared on Stateline.

Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.

But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.

Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”

Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, drew criticism from people who identify as transgender or nonbinary at a public hearing earlier this month. The bill would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify.
The substitute removed the section of the bill that did not allow a student to go by a name that is a derivative of their legal name.

Susan Dubose, R-Hoover, who read the substitute, said.
The committee adopted a substitute that added pronouns or names “patently inconsistent” with a student’s biological sex. The legislation requires students to get a permission slip signed by their parents if they use pronouns that do not reflect their biological sex. 
The bill passed with no discussion. It moves to the full House.

As Michigan House Republicans propose a budget that allocates no funding to the Office of Attorney General, as well as several government agencies in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 budget, Nessel said the result of such a decision would be disastrous.
“Let me tell you why that’s a bad idea. Our state would go bankrupt literally within weeks if that were that to happen,” Nessel said. “We defend all lawsuits against the state…and we’re the only department in the state that contributes revenue to the state that is not a tax or a fee.”
Operating on approximately one third of a percent of the state budget’s General Fund, about $120 million, Nessel said in 2024 the department won more than $500 million in court for Michiganders.

Nessel went on to say her office has obtained 11 settlements over her six-and-a-half-year tenure in its efforts to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for the opioid epidemic, which has resulted in thousands of overdoses in Michigan since 2000. These settlements have awarded $1.64 billion to the state to be distributed through local government and statewide government programs.
While there’s a lot of negative commentary regarding government employees, Nessel said, alluding to President Donald Trump’s executive actions to trim down the federal workforce and eliminate “bloat”, Nessel said her staff work tirelessly to improve the lives of Michiganders.
From educating elderly Michiganders on scams to investigating long-overlooked cases of missing and murdered indigenous residents, Nessel touted the work her office has done, including facilitating 315 individuals to enroll in the state’s Address Confidentiality Program to shield the addresses of those who have experienced domestic and sexual violence and stalking.
But it’s not just the Attorney General’s Office that is charged with helping Michiganders find justice, Nessel said, noting that county prosecutors play an instrumental role in the state’s justice system as the state faces a shortage of prosecutors amid staffing shortages and underfunding.
And now county prosecutor’s offices across Michigan face the task of reviewing hundreds of murder cases in a 180 day window after the Michigan Supreme Court eliminated mandatory life sentences without parole for 19- and 20-year-olds last week. The time schedule prescribed by the state court is “insanely short” Nessel said and will take an immense amount of effort from prosecutors to handle resentencings.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Twp.) has proposed cutbacks in the state budget for the Michigan Supreme Court and the State Court Administrative Office to invest into county prosecutors’ offices to address the workload.

“If the Michigan Supreme Court wants to upend the justice system and force communities to relive horrific crimes, they’re going to have to tighten their budget,” Bollin said in a news release Monday. “I’m going to make sure the people doing the real work — our local prosecutors — have the resources they need to keep dangerous criminals behind bars and fight for justice on behalf of victims and their families.”
It’s hard to explain the breadth of what the Supreme Court’s decision will mean for Michiganders, Nessel said. Beyond the “excruciating” experience for families of deceased victims during resentencing, cases will have to be revisited from decades ago and the effort it takes to rebuild a file will consume prosecutors’ offices.
“I hope when you’re formulating your budget, you just keep that in mind as to just how much work goes into that and how important it is for these types of cases, the most important kinds of cases where a person lost their life, so my hope is that you will consider that,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-16-at-5.04.04-PM-1024x579.png,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

The foundation records were posted online the same day that news emerged that Erik Dellenback, who has been executive director of Hope Florida since January, is stepping down from his post in the governor’s office. Dellenback, who remains chair of Florida Faith and Community Advisory Council, did not mention his pending resignation when he testified in a House hearing this week.
Hope Florida is an initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis to help steer people off public assistance programs. The foundation’s finances have come under scrutiny by the Florida House. Gov. DeSantis has criticized the probe as a “hoax” even as some House Republicans have questioned the legality of some transactions involving the Hope Florida Foundation, the program’s direct-support organization.
News of Dellenbeck’s resignation, first reported by Florida Politics, came as the Hope Florida Foundation made available its IRS form 990 for Aug. 25, 2023, through June 30, 2024, listing nine entities that made contributions. 
Hope Florida Foundation president Joshua Hay acknowledged this week that work on these tax documents did not begin until just a few weeks ago.
Ron DeSantis’ motto?
House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters Wednesday that the chamber’s probe into Hope Florida wouldn’t end when the legislative session is scheduled to wrap up on May 2.
“It is very clear by what has been put out there that Hope Florida could have been run better. That maybe transparency would be a benefit for Hope Florida. [The governor] refuses to acknowledge that; at least the chair of Hope Florida had the courage to do so,” Perez said. “Why is it that everyone around him has to abide by a certain set of rules?
“Rules for thee but not for me. That seems to be the motto of Ron DeSantis today.”
The board of directors will meet virtually Thursday to discuss the documents, which include bylaws and other material routinely associated with not-for-profit organizations. The board is also slated to discuss the state of the organization, its corporate governance, finances, public records, and public meeting laws, all to ensure it is furthering its mission and the Department of Children and Families’ priorities. That’s one of several agencies through which Hope Florida operates.
IRS Form 990 is the federal government’s tool for gathering information about tax-exempt organizations and is required to be submitted annually.
Medicaid managed care connection
The IRS Form 990 shows that the foundation had $809,293 cash on hand at the end of the reporting period.
The document doesn’t list the dates the contributions were made, only the time frame in which they were made.

Two state-contracted Medicaid managed care plans that were vying for lucrative new contracts made contributions to the Hope Florida Foundation. The contracts are the largest of their kind for the state and, according to the House of Representatives, the managed care plans will be paid $143 billion over the next six years to provide health care to the state’s poor, elderly, and disabled who rely on Medicaid for their health care.
The tax form shows that the Hope Florida Foundation received contributions from Simply Healthcare Plans and Centene, which contributed $98,408 and $95,223, respectively.
The state Agency for Health Care Administration announced plans to award new contracts in April and a second round of announcements in July. The decisions expanded statewide Simply Healthcare’s footprint in the Medicaid managed care marketplace. The new contracts have a requirement for the plans to work with Hope Florida and to report information about their members to Hope Florida. 
Meanwhile, the St. Joe Community Foundation made the largest contribution, according to the tax form: $200,000. The second largest contribution ($123,408) came from Tampa Electric Co.
Tidal Basin Government Consulting contributed $48,408; The Steven and Natalle Herring Family Foundation contributed $100,000; Lennar Foundation Inc. contributed $46,815; Gray Robinson contributed $23,408; and Baldwin Risk Partners contributed $25,000.

Second Centene payment
That was the first of at least two contributions health care giant Centene made to the foundation. In September 2024, Centene made a one-time $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation, first disclosed by former Department of Children and Families Secretary Shevaun Harris during a House Health Care Budget Subcommittee meeting earlier this month. 
The $10 million was part of a larger settlement the Medicaid managed care plan signed with the state to resolve overpayments for pharmacy benefits and services.
The foundation channeled the $10 million to two groups that turned around and contributed to another group battling last year’s initiative on recreational marijuana. The DeSantis administration organized opposition to that and the abortion-rights amendment using state resources. Both proposals were broadly popular but fell narrowly short of the required 60% approval rate.
DeSantis’ anti-pot committee, Keep Florida Clean, was run by James Uthmeier, then DeSantis’ chief of staff, whom the governor subsequently appointed as state attorney general following Ashley Moody’s departure for the U.S. Senate.

Scrutiny over Hope Florida also surfaced in the Senate the day before Dellenback’s resignation became public. Senators expressed doubts Tuesday about advancing a proposal, SB 820, formalizing in statute the Office of Faith and Community, which Dellenback also led.
Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about the connection between Hope Florida and the Governor’s Faith and Community Initiative through Dellenback’s leadership.
Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo pointed out Dellenback’s involvement in both programs during the Tuesday meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government.
“I don’t dislike it enough to vote no on it, but I am very concerned. I think we need to think carefully now that more information has come forward in this own committee meeting,” Winter Haven Republican Sen. Colleen Burton said. “I think we need to be very, very careful that if we do enshrine this in statute, that this office stands on its own two feet, that it’s not associated with other organizations.”
The House companion to that bill, HB 293, is scheduled for its final committee hearing on Thursday. 
Before the election, Dellenback joined Florida Family Voice’s tour throughout the state advocating against the passage of the ballot initiative to protect abortion access in the state constitution. 
During the Tallahassee stop of the anti-abortion tour, Dellenback thanked the people on behalf of the governor and first lady.
“Tonight, I represent government, but I have spent way more time as a faith person than I have as a government person. And this was a biblical issue before it was a political issue,” Dellenback told the crowd of nearly 100 people at Four Oaks Community Church in Killearn, a capital city suburb.

(Courtesy of the University of Idaho)A University of Idaho grant to help Idaho farmers develop climate-smart practices has been terminated. 
The $59 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program was the largest in the university’s history. 
Established under the Biden administration, it would have funded the university’s Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Partnership project, which opened applications earlier this year. It was a statewide project that would have paid farmers to incorporate practices that reduced the climate impact within Idaho’s top commodities including potatoes, sugar beets, wheat, barley, hops, chickpeas and beef.
As of March, 201 Idaho producers representing 27 Idaho counties had applied for the grant, according to a press release from the university on Wednesday.
But the grant was terminated as the USDA changed its criteria to evaluate climate-smart grants, referred to as “Farmer First” policy priorities. The new criteria asks that 65% of grant funds go directly to farmers. While more than 50% of the university’s proposal went toward payment to farmers — with the remaining funds going toward technical and marketing services for farmers — the project no longer qualifies for the grant under the new criteria. 
The USDA is rebranding the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which it called in a press release a “Biden era climate slush fund,” as the Advancing Markets for Producers initiative. 
The University of Idaho has the opportunity to resubmit a proposal by June 20 with adjustments to meet the new criteria. 
“While we are disappointed by the USDA decision to terminate the IAMP grant, we are thankful for the opportunity to resubmit our proposal,” co-director of the program Sanford Eigenbrode said in a press release. “The objectives of the IAMP project are in line with the expected guidelines from (the USDA) and their Farmer First priorities, and we are in a good position to reconfigure the project to meet those guidelines.” 
The USDA committed to honoring all eligible expenses incurred prior to April 13. The University of Idaho said it is in contact with its implementing partners and several producers to ensure any eligible expenses incurred prior to this date are reimbursed.

The Montana Legislature approved raising nonresident fees to purchase bonus raffle points for a coveted Smith River permit, funding maintenance along the scenic corridor and purportedly giving a slight edge toward resident floaters .
Located in central Montana, flowing north through the Big Belt Mountains toward Great Falls, the Smith River — a 59-mile stretch of which is officially Smith River State Park — is the only river in Montana that requires a permit for all recreational access.
Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, said the increasing popularity of the Smith River and the effects of compounded use, were reasons she brought Senate Bill 257.
The secluded stretch of river is so popular that the lottery system sees more than 20,000 individuals enter each year, with roughly 1,200 permits available. Of that, nonresidents can only receive 10% of available permits.
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks operates the permitting lottery with a bonus point system — applicants pay to enter the lottery and each year can purchase an additional bonus point to increase their chances of being selected. Bonus points can accumulate each year an applicant doesn’t draw a permit and the points are squared during the drawing.
Smith’s bill more than doubles the cost of bonus points for out-of-state individuals, from $50 to $125, while resident’s pay just $5.
“When I was door knocking, one things folks talked about in addition to public lands was Smith River permits. They were talking about the fact that people weren’t really pulling the permit, and so I looked at the bonus point system and what the money goes to,” Smith told the Senate Fish and Game Committee in February.
Revenue from the bonus point system goes into the state’s Smith River Enhancement Account, to “protect and enhance the integrity of the natural and scenic beauty of the Smith River waterway and its recreational, fisheries, and wildlife values.”
“Because of the increased foot traffic, in and out use, some of the funds have been used to improve the put in and put out,” Smith told the committee. “Ten years ago, when my now husband and I floated it, we used to camp at the put in. They said the impact at the bank, with so many people putting into the river there, really eroded those river banks. So they used this money to restore the put in and take out.”
According to the bill’s fiscal note, 1,114 nonresident bonus points were sold in 2024, and under the new fee structure would provide a more than $83,000 boost to revenue.
Revenue from the account has also been used to work on waste disposal systems along the river — which has no public access along its 59-mile stretch — and to purchase or lease adjacent land.
“The money goes to good causes that preserve the integrity of the river,” Smith said.
Trout Unlimited, the Montana Wildlife Federation and several individuals, including fishing guides, supported the legislation in committee hearings.
The bill sailed through the Senate with just four votes in opposition. The bill was unanimously concurred in the House on 2nd reading, but drew two nay votes on the final vote Wednesday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/smithriverpaddle.jpg,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

(Gavel photo by Getty Images; seal courtesy the State of Iowa)The House Government Oversight Committee questioned officials from the Iowa Judicial Branch and State Court Administration Wednesday while investigating the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds caused by programming errors.
Committee members heard testimony and asked questions of State Court Administrator Robert Gast, Iowa Judicial Branch attorney Amber Shanahan-Fricke and Caitlin Jarzen, the branch’s director of government affairs, about how errors in the programming used for court fine distributions that resulted in misappropriated money.
In 2020 and 2021, state lawmakers passed legislation that “significantly modified how court debt is collected and distributed,” judicial branch staff said in an October statement. Reprogramming the judicial branch’s case management system for these changes resulted in programming errors, according to the statement, which in turn resulted in incorrect distributions of court debt funds.
According to a December 2024 report by Auditor Rob Sand, the errors caused seven state funds, including the Victim Compensation Fund, to be underfunded between fiscal years 2021 through 2024, while the state’s general fund and two other funds received over-allocations.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the meeting, lawmakers criticized the Judicial Branch for not sharing information on the error and resulting misallocations with lawmakers until a significant period of time had passed after the problem was identified. In October 2024, House Speaker Pat Grassley and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen sent letters to Sand criticizing the auditor’s office for not taking action on the issue earlier, as the auditor’s office was alerted of financial irregularities in 2022 by the state Department of Transportation.
Sand, the only Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Iowa, and state GOP leaders had criticized one another for responsibility of investigating and addressing the impacts of the misallocations in 2024. But at the House committee meeting Wednesday, lawmakers said it is a bipartisan effort to ensure this issue is addressed and similar errors do not occur. Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, said the issue is “not partisan at all,” and the Legislature should be working together to find ways to fix the issue and attempt to simplify Iowa Code to prevent future errors.
“I ask that we collectively try to find ways — maybe there’s other states that do it better, maybe there’s a way we can make it home grown — but I ask that we collectively, in a bipartisan fashion, in a nonpartisan fashion, find solutions going forward,” Baeth said.
Gast, the court administrator, said in a December 2024 letter the judicial branch had implemented corrections to the programming errors in the case management system as of Nov. 22. He said in the letter the branch had contracted with a third party — Zirous, a West Des Moines information technology firm — to review and audit the new programming. He also told the committee the judicial branch was developing an internal auditing process for future programming changes.
Addressing questions from lawmakers on why the Legislature and other state entities were not informed earlier about the issues, Gast said delays in releasing information came as the process for working with a national consulting group to identify the errors took longer than expected.
“We wanted to have the full scope and breadth before we came to you and not come in, and (say) ‘the sky is falling!’ and not have some idea of what we were looking at,” Gast said.
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, a lawyer, said he had doubts about the judicial branch’s response on sharing certain emails and communications about the errors, and the timelines it would take to receive this information.
“I’ve practiced for 38 years and I know malarkey when I see it, and I know malarkey discovery responses when I see them,” Thomson said.
Court officials said they are willing to share information, and asked lawmakers to submit their requests in writing with time periods, involved parties and search terms specified.
Gast and Shanahan-Fricke said the judicial branch plans to present a technical bill next year that will keep the percentages of debt distribution in line with what the Legislature intended in previous bills, but would create a new framework for distributing the money that would address these errors.
“Along with the changes we’ve implemented internally on how we move forward on programming, and especially financial programming, I believe with what we’ve done in that bill, we will be able to put this to bed,” Gast said.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 
 
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.










There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher


Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

StebbinsAs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or USACE, continues to prepare the draft of its long-awaited environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project; the Corps confirmed on Wednesday that its evaluation would move forward on a shortened timeline following an executive order from President Donald Trump. 
The project would replace a four-mile section of the pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac with a new segment located in a concrete-lined tunnel beneath the lakebed, intended to contain any potential spills from the pipeline.

However, Native American Tribes and environmental activists have long argued the pipeline poses too much of a threat to continue operating in the Straits — where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet — as tribal nations and environmental organizations have brought forth several legal challenges against the project, raising concerns about the impacts of both constructing the tunnel and allowing Line 5 to continue operating. 
In order to move forward with construction, Enbridge Energy, the Canadian company that owns the pipeline, must secure permits from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
As part of its permitting review, the Corps must issue an environmental impact statement examining the natural, cultural and human environment before making its permitting decision. In 2023, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would extend its review for the statement, with plans to issue a draft statement in 2025 and a final decision expected in early 2026. However, a decision could come much sooner following an order from President Trump instructing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to exercise emergency permitting power to facilitate the nation’s energy supply.
Following Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order which declared a national energy emergency in order to boost fossil fuel production, many Line 5 opponents warned that the order could impact the Corps’ review of the tunnel project. 
After several indications that the Line 5 tunnel would receive expedited processing, members of the Corps confirmed on Wednesday that the project would be reviewed under emergency procedures. 
While members of the Corps could not offer an updated timeline for the project, Shane McCoy, the regulatory chief for the USACE’s Detroit District told reporters on Wednesday the draft environmental impact statement would most likely be released in June. 
Though the timeline for the project has been shortened, McCoy said the emergency procedures would not eliminate any steps from the review, later telling reporters, “We have full confidence that we will be making the decision based on the best information available.”

“The truncated process will result in a very legally defensible and very well informed decision in our record of decision,” McCoy said. 
McCoy also emphasized that the decision on whether to permit the project would not be determined prior to the completion of its analysis and all required consultations and coordinations. However, Whitney Gravelle, president of the Bay Mills Indian Community, said she didn’t believe that. 
On March 21, the Bay Mills Indian Community alongside the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi sent a letter to the USACE, withdrawing their participation as cooperating agencies in drafting the environmental impact statement due to the expectation that the project would soon receive permitting due to Trump’s executive order. The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians similarly withdrew from talks with the USACE on March 26. 
While USACE Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said tribal input helped shape and refine cultural resource surveys and reports and the consideration of cultural resources in the Corps of Engineers review, Gravelle said the process was inherently flawed, and that they had repeatedly submitted comments, data and scientific fact that was ignored. 
Despite the departure of the seven tribes participating as cooperating agencies, the USACE told reporters it continues to consult with them, as well as 13 other tribal nations. 
While the Corps determined Enbridge’s permit request met the definition of Trump’s emergency order, Gravelle said she’d like to know where the emergency is. 
“Emergency measures are in place for things like flooding or wildfires or loss of life and property, and how would Line 5 impact anyone in any way,” Gravelle said pointing to the Edenville Dam failure and Enbridge’s 2010 oil spill in the Kalamazoo River as recent examples of emergency permitting within the state. 
Should the project move forward, it would have detrimental harm to an already vulnerable population of white fish and lake trout in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which would reduce tribal fishing in the Straits, Gravelle said.

In 1836, the Anishinaabe signed the Treaty of Washington, ceding nearly 14 million acres of land to settlers. In return, Anishinaabe peoples would retain the right to hunt, fish and gather within the ceded territory. 
“We’ve shared evidence with them. Locations of, you know, fish spawning beds in both of the lakes, we’ve shared with them  cultural historic properties, both on the North and the South Shore…. we’re trying to not only prevent future harm, but we’re also trying to protect and preserve what we have now,” Gravelle said. 
“And nobody hears that right? Like nobody can understand the importance of tribal treaty rights, because when they think of treaty rights, they just think of someone going out and catching a fish. And they don’t realize that this is tied to teachings that you get from your parents on where to fish and how to fish, and then, you know, teachings that you get from your elders when you have fish at ceremony, or teachings on how to interact with the landscape, or like, why do we fish during these seasons, but not during the other seasons. It’s all interwoven into our Indigenous way of life,” Gravelle said. 
In a statement responding to the USACE’s notice, Gravelle’s message was simple: “We will continue to defend the rights of the Great Lakes. See you in court.”
“That’s exactly how I feel,” Gravelle told the Michigan Advance. “We have been setting ourselves up and positioning ourselves now that we will fight for our rights before the court, and we will do it not only on behalf of tribes, but on behalf of the rest of the Great Lakes.” 
When asked what the community was looking to challenge, Gravelle said all options were on the table, down to the executive order and the determination that the project meets emergency permitting criteria. 
“When you are threatening tribes and tribal people and our community’s way of life, there’s nothing to do, but left to fight and to fight, so that we can continue to exist,” Gravelle said. 
As the Army Corps of Engineers moves forward with its review, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission have already granted the project its necessary permits. 
However, the The Bay Mills Indian Community, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi alongside Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network have sought leave to appeal the Public Service Commission’s decision to the Supreme Court, after a previous court upheld the Commission’s decision. The Great Lakes water advocacy group For Love of Water — or FLOW — has filed a separate application aiming to appeal the case.

Additionally Enbridge must redo its water resources permit as part of a legal agreement with EGLE and the Bay Mills Indian Community. EGLE Strategic Communications Advisor Scott Dean told the Michigan Advance on April 3 that EGLE is currently reviewing two applications for construction activities related to the tunnel, including a joint permitting application covering its Wetlands Protection and Great Lakes Bottomlands permits.
EGLE is also considering Enbridge’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, with its current permit set to expire on Oct. 1, 2025. The permit aims to protect water quality by limiting the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a body of water.
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy referenced a previous statement when asked about the USACE’s shortened permitting pathway, calling the pipeline “critical energy infrastructure” 
“In 2021 the State of Michigan issued its environmental permits for the tunnel project, and in 2023 the Michigan Public Service Commission approved placing the new pipeline segment in the tunnel as Line 5 crosses the Straits of Mackinac. However, the project still awaits action by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on an environmental impact statement and a permitting decision,” Duffy said, adding that the company had reapplied for permits from EGLE which were set to expire in 2026.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC_04072-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 19:07:40.724124

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Senate Taxation Committee made headway on the property tax debate by moving several bills originating in the House through the committee on Wednesday morning, despite reservations by several legislators.
Gov. Greg Gianforte’s favored bill, House Bill 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad,  moved on, as did House Bill 155, which has become a flagship bill from Democrats in both chambers. Some Republicans also feel rebates are the way to provide tax relief, while the HB 231 camp and the Democrats try and adjust tax rates.
House Bill 528, which was a late, under-the-radar and bipartisan bill from Rep. Ed Bryne, R-Bigfork, was tabled in the committee.
A motion to reconsider House Bill 154, a renter tax credit Democrats had previously hinted wasn’t dead, also failed to move to the floor. Senate Bill 90, a bill favored by Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, and conservative members of his caucus, continues to hang around as a property tax option in the House.
SB 90 is a tax rebate that Democrats say does not provide enough relief. SB 90 has been added to HB 924, which includes a property tax credit. That legislation that would create a $1 billion trust that serves multiple interests, including childcare, infrastructure and disaster resilience. 
“Senate Bill 90 is alive and well,” Sen. Greg Hertz, chair of Senate Taxation said during the meeting.
His words were foreshadowing — Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings made a reconsideration motion on SB 90 during the House’s floor session. Around a dozen House members rose to speak during discussion on the blast motion, which ultimately failed by one vote.
The committee made several amendments on both HB 155 and HB 231. For HB 155, brought by Rep. Mark Thane, D-Missoula, the amendment included language to roll back property tax rates to 2024 and provide a homestead exemption on the first $50,000 of a home, bringing some Democrats into opposition because of those changes.
“155 now is different. It’s changed,” Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena said during the meeting. “I went from a yes to a no. It’s changed that much.”
Amendments to HB 231 included pushing the effective date back, as the bill was originally looking to be passed in March, and adding language to help fix a major hurdle for much of the property tax legislation — issues with charters in several cities that could see an increase local property taxes with the bill as introduced.
Language in HB 231 was amended to give local governments the option to switch from a mill-based levy to a dollar-based levy should they so choose.
There was also some debate over whether reimbursing cities with charters that conflict with state money could be a realistic option. Hertz said he thinks telling cities to ignore their charters is unconstitutional and had little doubt it would be challenged in court. 
HB 155 and HB 231 will now head to the Senate floor for the full Senate to consider. Property taxes remain a major hurdle for the Legislature as the end of the session nears and Montanans face another jump in property values.
“I committed to Representative Jones to get this bill out of here,” Hertz said of HB 231. “I don’t like it. It’s more or less a Frankenstein bill now, but I hope we can get this bill out of here so we can have the discussion on the floor.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate_door_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, and Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, react to new forecast data projecting $2 billion less in state revenue on April 16, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In a sharp turnaround from the flush financial fortunes of the last budget cycle, Indiana’s projected revenue for the next budget cycle fell by $2 billion according to new forecast data publicized on Wednesday. 
The current budget cycle for the 2025 fiscal year is also short by an estimated $400 million, though closing that gap will likely rely on reserves. 
Indiana’s tax revenue is still growing but not at the rate anticipated.
According to chief budget architects Sen. Ryan Mishler and Rep. Jeff Thompson, “everything is on the table” when it comes to potential cuts.

“We just have a lot of tough decisions to make and we have to be disciplined,” said Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “… K-12 education is the last thing we want to do anything with so I would prefer to put everything else in front of that.”
When it came to increasing so-called sin taxes — whether on gaming, cigarettes or alcohol, Thompson didn’t rule it out. 
“All of those things have to be discussed,” said the Lizton Republican. 
For longtime lawmakers, the news invoked memories of budgeting after the 2008 recession, when the state weathered more than a billion-dollar shortfall. 
“This one scares me a lot more because the number is a lot higher. And back then, if you remember, we had federal money to backfill. We don’t have any federal money to backfill. This is all on us,” said Mishler. “So we’re going to have to live within our means.”
With a goal to finish the 2025 legislative session next week, lawmakers don’t have much time to identify potential cuts — though the two Republicans anticipated long nights ahead to meet that preferred deadline.
Democrats pointed to the need to protect Hoosiers during uncertain economic times and minimizing harm through state resources.  
“We are extremely concerned for Hoosiers across the state, because the same underlying conditions that are impacting the state budget are impacting Hoosiers,” said Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “From the price of goods and services to the challenges of those who rely on retirement funds to small businesses relying on their products that they ship.”
Qaddoura noted that Senate Democrats had pushed to incorporate sin taxes into the budget earlier in the week, adding that a $2 cigarette tax increase would bring in an estimated $800 million. 
Moments after release of the downgraded forecast, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce called for the General Assembly to pull the trigger on that tax.
“A big action still on the table this legislative session is a minimum $2 per pack increase to the cigarette tax,” said President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “We urge lawmakers to put the increase in the state budget – both for the positive impact on the health of Hoosiers who smoke and the additional revenue.”
 What happened?

The December forecast data included roughly $800 million in new revenue for the state over the next two years, though nearly all of that came in the first year. Now even that marginal growth is gone. 
Much of the loss can be attributed to economic uncertainty, including worries about the impact of tariffs in the country’s most manufacturing-intensive state. 
“When the U.S. gets a cold, Indiana gets pneumonia,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis. “We’re a manufacturing state and (with) the tariffs and other issues out there in the federal government … this really affects our bottom line.”

According to an analysis from Axios Indianapolis, Indiana is the third-most reliant state when it comes to China, which imported $6.1 billion in Hoosier goods in 2023. More than half of that was in pharmaceuticals and medicines followed by oilseeds and grains. 
Democrats pointed to potential areas for savings, including pushing back anticipated income tax cuts and clawing back money from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. 
Qaddoura went even further, targeting the use of vouchers by wealthy families to attend private schools.
“I think if we’re looking at K-12 cuts, we definitely need to look at reversing the voucher program back to the 2021 level to be sure that the ultra-wealthy are not benefiting while we’re cutting … funding for K-12 education across the state,” he said. 
He said such a move would save an estimated $309 million. 
Potentially the biggest bill in the 2025 session altered property taxes with an explicit goal to give two-thirds of homeowners relief, at a loss for local units of governments and school corporations. 
Thompson said that effort, which has been signed into law, doesn’t need to be revisited in light of the news about the state’s finances. 
“I can tell you right now that the Indiana projected revenue is probably less than most locals. We’re probably in a tougher spot than they are,” Thompson said.
Gov. Mike Braun focused  on cutting waste, eliminating overhead, and getting back to the basics.
“We must finalize a biennial budget that respects the revenue forecast and protects Hoosier taxpayers from a worst-case scenario,” he said. “I will work with the General Assembly to craft a budget that is structurally balanced, maintains strong reserves, and funds vital services like public safety and education.”
 What about Medicaid?

In a small spot of positive news, Mishler noted that the growth of Medicaid appeared to be slowing. 
Medicaid rolls were just over 1% lower than previously estimated, a difference of less than 30,000 Hoosiers. More than 2 million residents rely on the program for their health care coverage. 
Breaking down budgets: Why Medicaid expenses are growing

But, as an entitlement program, much of the program can’t be cut — meaning that the state will likely remain committed to spending roughly $10 billion over the next two years. 
“We’re trying to make some changes to try to help us in the Medicaid space,” said Mishler, pointing to his efforts under Senate Bill 2. 
However, much remains uncertain about Medicaid’s future, especially with several large pieces of legislation still up in the air. 
Under Mishler’s bill, most able-bodied working-age adults would be required to work at least 20 hours a week to keep their benefits.
Additionally, changes to the state’s calculation of the hospital assessment fee or implementing the managed care assessment fee weren’t included in Wednesday’s presentation, though the latter could bring in $1.4 billion if fully implemented. 
But Mitch Roob, who helms the agency overseeing Medicaid, said he didn’t believe the Trump administration would allow the state to leverage the tax to the maximum extent.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Even though New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham struck language directing $80 million in new housing money to the state’s biggest city, Albuquerque officials believe the state will still provide adequate funds this upcoming fiscal year to help address the housing crisis. 
The governor late last week signed the record $10.8 billion budget lawmakers sent to her during the 60-day session, which included$110 million “to support housing, affordable housing, transitional housing and the expansion of housing services.” 
While the governor approved the total allocation — which the state Department of Finance and Administration will oversee — she crossed out language from lawmakers specifying $80 million for programs in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County, along with $10 million they had specified for Las Cruces and Doña Ana County. 
Striking the language did not impact the $110 million payment to the state Department of Finance and Administration, which will oversee the housing funds. However, legislative leaders had previously highlighted those earmarks as important because they directed most of the money to the areas where populations and needs are the biggest. 
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

“I think we’re investing far more in a targeted way that’s going to help bring folks off the streets and into homes,” said Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces) in a Feb. 24 news conference touting the House’s budget proposals. 
In a statement to Source New Mexico on Wednesday, the governor’s office defended striking the language, saying that now DFA will have more flexibility. 
“The removed language could have been interpreted as restrictive, effectively stating, ‘These are the only permitted uses for these funds,” governor’s spokesperson Jodi McGinnis-Porter said in an email. “By eliminating these constraints, DFA will have enhanced agility to respond to changing circumstances.”
Staci Dragmeister, a spokesperson for the City of Albuquerque, said the city is “optimistic” the change won’t affect the amount of money heading its way for housing. 
“The Governor kept the funding in place and there is a clear, critical need for more affordable housing and homeless services in Albuquerque,” she told Source in an email Wednesday. “The City is optimistic the funding will be used to help residents in Albuquerque and is ready to put it to work to build housing and expand services.”
A recent report from Pew Charitable Trusts found that homelessness in Albuquerque increased 108% between 2017 and 2024, which is more than the 87% increase seen across the state and nearly three times the 40% national average increase during that period. Despite adding more than 31,000 jobs in the last three years, city developers have added only 9,000 new housing units during that period. 
The line in the budget authorizing the $110 million in housing spending money to DFA specifies that the money is for affordable and transitional housing, and the expansion of housing services providers that “facilitate behavioral health services and substance abuse recovery, homelessness assistance and prevention for persons with behavioral health needs.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rentcontrol1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A Sioux City hospital nurse, fired for numerous alleged instances of substandard care in the emergency room, is not entitled to unemployment benefits, a judge has ruled.
State records show that on Dec. 18, 2024, registered nurse Corriene McKeown was scheduled to work from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the emergency room at Sioux City’s MercyOne Siouxland Medical Center.
During her shift, the hospital later alleged, McKeown provided substandard nursing care to eight separate patients. For seven of the eight patients, McKeown allegedly failed to complete the required assessments. For one patient, McKeown allegedly failed to complete the required handoff in charting to ensure continuity of care once the patient was admitted to the hospital.
For another patient, who was admitted to the ER at 12:35 p.m. after complaining of increased confusion, McKeown allegedly failed to complete a level of consciousness assessment until 7 p.m.
For a third patient, who was admitted to the ER at 5:52 p.m., McKeown allegedly failed to complete time-sensitive triage medical charting until 7:10 p.m. and the absence of that charting contributed to a delay in patient care.
When hospital officials later met with McKeown to discuss the alleged deficiencies, McKeown asserted the ER had been busy and short-staffed, and that she could provide good patient care or good charting, but not both. According to the hospital, McKeown had previously been counseled about charting in April 2024 and June 2024.
On Jan. 28, 2025, McKeown was fired. After a hearing on her application for unemployment benefits, Administrative Law Judge James Timberland concluded recently the “weight of the evidence establishes multiple instances of carelessness” by McKeown on Dec. 18, 2024, and he ruled McKeown was ineligible for benefits.
“These were part of a pattern of carelessness,” Timberland stated in his ruling. That “careless performance,” he added, included “multiple instances of failing to properly and timely chart patient care, directly impacted patient care, directly impacted the employer’s ability to provide appropriate patient care, and indicated a willful disregard of the employer’s reasonable nursing care standards.”
Other unemployment cases
Other Iowa caregivers whose unemployment cases were recently decided include:
— Debra Rawlins, who worked as a certified nurse aide for On With Life from November 2023 until January 2025, when she was fired after being accused of repeatedly abandoning her duties and neglecting brain-injured residents in her care. The final incident leading to her dismissal occurred on Jan. 8, 2025, when she allegedly disappeared repeatedly from her assigned area and then failed to respond to calls made through a mobile communication system. She was accused of loitering in a single-occupant restroom for 45 to 60 minutes until being discovered there by a nurse on duty.
According to her employer, Rawlins had twice been counseled previously for neglecting her assigned residents for 30 to 60 minutes. On New Year’s Eve 2024, the company alleged, management suspected Rawlins was under the influence of alcohol while at work but elected not to invoke its alcohol-testing protocol. Administrative Law Judge James Timberland ruled recently that Rawlins was ineligible for unemployment benefits, concluding she had “neglected the brain-injured residents in her care so that she could loiter while on the clock.”
— Bernice Thompson, who worked as a receptionist for Universal Health Services Midwest, which operates Clive Behavioral Health. She was fired after allegedly failing to comply with policies tied to the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, which requires hospitals to stabilize patients before discharge.
The hospital policy barred patients from leaving prematurely without signing records acknowledging they were leaving against medical advice. Thompson had reportedly objected to that policy, arguing it violated patients’ human rights, unlawfully held them hostage and amounted to some form of Medicaid fraud. She was denied unemployment benefits, with a judge finding her conduct “disregarded the wellbeing of the patients and violated the employer’s EMTALA policy.”
— Damariss Magne, who worked as a certified nurse aide for Christian Retirement Homes from August 2024 through January 2025, when she was fired. The care facility alleged that on the evening of Jan. 12, 2025, Magne discovered that one resident of the home had fallen out of bed, with their face and arms on the floor, and their legs still on the bed. With the help of another CNA, she placed the resident back in bed but didn’t inform a nurse of the fall until an hour had passed. The company fired Magne, alleging that video showed during the hour after the fall Magne was in close proximity to nurses on multiple occasions and could have informed them of the incident. She was denied unemployment benefits.
— Jonnie Weeks-Almaguer, who worked as a certified nurse aide for the nursing home Corning Specialty Care from April 2024 until she was fired in February 2025 for allegedly verbally abusing a resident. On Feb. 19, 2025, another CNA at the home, Destiny Luft, had reported overhearing Weeks-Almaguer say to a resident something to the effect of, “You need to clean yourself up because you did it to yourself.” The resident allegedly corroborated Luft’s claim. Weeks-Almaguer was denied unemployment benefits.
— Kelley Bender, who worked for the Madrid Home for the Aging as the director of nursing from September 2023 until she was fired in January 2025. Several weeks before she was fired, Bender had talked to the home’s compliance officer about concerns she had with the leadership of the home’s administrator, Rick Colby, and the home’s failure to report an incident of some kind. Days later, she met with the home’s CEO to discuss the same concerns.
Shortly thereafter, the home’s management launched an investigation of Bender, who had no incurred no prior warnings or disciplinary actions while working at the home. Management interviewed Bender’s colleagues and subordinates and gathered complaints from multiple workers. Without speaking to Bender, management allegedly opted to fire her. Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson recently ruled Bender is entitled to unemployment benefits, finding that the home’s stated reason for its investigation lacked credibility, and that “it seems more likely that her discharge was triggered by her report to the CEO than by her actual conduct at work.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

Free.,Maryland senator denied visitation with wrongly deported man in El Salvador,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-senator-denied-visitation-wrongly-deported-man-el-salvador,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen Chris Van Hollen said Wednesday he was denied a meeting with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador-born Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in his home country notorious for human rights abuses.The Maryland Democrat met with El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa in the Central American country in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States. Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador, but a U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 finding that sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger.After meeting with Ulloa, Van Hollen briefed reporters on the visit and said the Salvadoran vice president rebuffed his requests for contact with Abrego Garcia.“I asked the vice president if I could meet with Mr. Abrego Garcia and he said, ‘Well, you need to make earlier provisions to go visit CECOT (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo),’” Van Hollen told reporters in El Salvador, referring to the mega-prison.“I said, ‘I’m not interested, at this moment, in taking a tour of CECOT, I just want to meet with Mr. Abrego Garcia,’” Van Hollen said.“He said he was not able to make that happen. He said he’d need a little more time. I asked him if I came back next week, whether I’d be able to see Mr. Abrego Garcia. He said he couldn’t promise that either,” the senator added. Van Hollen said he was also denied a phone or video call with Abrego Garcia to ask how he was doing and report that information to his family. The senator said he would contact the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and request they ask the government of El Salvador to connect the two of them via phone, following a suggestion from Ulloa.Van Hollen’s visit came a day after a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but did not require — his return to the United States. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele also said Monday that he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.The Trump administration has acknowledged in court that Abrego Garcia was deported due to an “administrative error.”The administration accused him of being a member of the gang MS-13. He has not been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses, including gang-related crimes.Van Hollen, noting that the Trump administration “illegally abducted” Abrego Garcia, said he “won’t stop trying” to get the wrongly deported man out of the prison and back to Maryland and predicted others would follow.“I can assure the president, the vice president that I may be the first United States senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more, and there will be more members of Congress coming,” he said.Administration respondsMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security posted on social media Wednesday a copy of a restraining order Abrego Garcia’s wife sought against him in 2021 “claiming he punched, scratched, and ripped off her shirt, among other harm.”In response, Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, told Newsweek she had a disagreement with him, but that things did not escalate and she did not continue with the civil court process. Late Wednesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made a statement on the case, displaying the restraining order, repeating the accusation Abrego Garcia is a gang member and objecting to media references to him as a “Maryland father.”“There is no Maryland father,” she said.Patty Morin, the mother of a Maryland woman slain by a Salvadoran immigrant in the country without legal status, also appeared at the briefing and spoke in favor of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation actions.",,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

Seth Magaziner, right, holds a routable discussion with business and labor leaders inside the  International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 11's Cranston offices on April 16, 2025. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) CRANSTON — President Donald Trump’s tariff policy is rattling more than international markets. It’s fueling economic uncertainty among Rhode Island’s business and labor leaders.
“It’s like throwing a cat into a bathtub full of water,” said Justin Kelley, a business representative and political director for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 11. “It’s going to react, naturally, very poorly most of the time.” 
Kelley made the comments at a roundtable of local leaders from Rhode Island’s building trades, hospitality, and medical equipment industries hosted by U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner at the union’s Cranston office Wednesday afternoon.
Hours after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs went into effect April 8, he placed a 90-day pause on nearly all of them. His universal 10% duty on imports from nearly every country remains in place, along with a 125% tariff on goods coming in from China. 
The 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which went into effect on March 12, still remain in effect as well. Those duties will likely increase construction costs of projects employing Council 11’s roughly 600 Rhode Island-based workers.
Kelley told Rhode Island Current the union still has two years worth of public projects on the books. But if costs continue to spiral, he said projects will either reduce in scope or completely halt.
“If the steel doesn’t go up, we can’t paint the steel — and then we can’t put the drywall in and paint the building and do what we do,” he told Magaziner. “We have to figure out a way to try to mitigate this.”
Darryl Lindie, owner of AA Sign & Awning in Warwick, said he’s already had customers back out of signage projects after his team had completed the designs. On his way to the roundtable, he received a notification from a client who decided not to move forward with a project.
“I’m biased. I want to sell people the most signage that I can,” Lindie said. “You hate to see scopes of work decrease.”
​​Lauryn Estrella, executive director of the Home Medical Equipment and Services Association of New England, said many suppliers have been receiving notifications from manufacturers that they may have to raise the prices for wheelchairs and oxygen tanks.
“Our patients are the elderly and the disabled,” Estrella said. “They’re just being abandoned.”
Ryan Moot, manager of business development and government affairs for the Rhode Island Hospitality Association, told Magaziner that while restaurants aim to source locally whenever possible, it’s not feasible for commodities like coffee.
Most seafood sold in Rhode Island is caught in international waters, Moot said. Even catches hauled stateside, he said, are often processed outside the United States.
Moot recalled being with a seafood wholesaler in Washington D.C. when the tariffs were announced. He said the man frantically called everyone on the supply chain wondering just how much he would have to pay for shrimp coming in from Vietnam.
“There’s just so much that simply can’t be produced here,” Moot said.
Tariffs could lead to higher menu prices, which will turn away diners.
“There might be bigger brands that are more able to take that hit without passing it on to customers,” Moot said. But not the smaller local restaurants.
Who has the tariff authority?
Under the U.S. Constitution, the power to tax and tariff falls squarely on Congress, not the White House. 
But the legislative branch over the years has enacted laws giving the president some tariff powers, most notably through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The 1977 law gives the president the power to regulate international commerce in the event of a national emergency, which Trump has invoked in his latest attempt to tackle the nation’s trade deficit.
Congress could pass a law to regain its power over tariff policy with a veto-proof vote, but the  Republican-led House of Representatives on April 9 approved a procedural rule prohibiting the chamber from considering legislation to rescind the tariffs until at least Sept. 30.
Rhode Island’s Royal Charter inspires lawmaker’s idea for coping with tariff troubles

“If Republicans in Congress would actually grow a spine and have the courage to stand up to president Trump, in theory we could end these tariffs tomorrow,” Magaziner told Rhode Island Current. “But so far, the Republican leadership isn’t willing to do that.”
GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa has proposed a bill requiring the president to notify Congress of impending tariffs within 48 hours, which Trump has threatened to veto. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, has filed companion legislation in the House. Magaziner commended his GOP colleagues, but said there still needs to be popular support across the aisle.
In the meantime, Magaziner told industry leaders to continue to use their personal stories to raise the alarm.
“The administration has shown they are susceptible to public pressure, particularly on this,” he said. “The American people clearly do not want this.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A federal judge has temporarily blocked the cancellation of a 21-year-old University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate student’s visa and any actions in relation to that by the Trump administration. 
Krish Lal Isserdasani, who is from India, has been studying computer engineering at the UW-Madison since 2021 with plans to graduate on May 10. On April 4, just a month before graduation, Isserdasani received notification from UW-Madison’s International Student Services office that his visa was cancelled and his authorization to be in the country would end on May 2. He received no communication from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the State Department regarding the visa revocation.  
His cancellation was part of a wave of cancellations at universities across the country as President Donald Trump’s administration targets international students and ramps up deportation efforts in a crackdown on immigration.
U.S. District Judge William Conley wrote in his order Tuesday that Isserdasani has a “reasonable likelihood of success” on his claim that his visa was wrongly terminated and faces “possible devastating irreparable harm” as a result of the cancellation. Conley’s order bans the government from revoking his visa, detaining him or taking any other actions related to the cancellation pending a preliminary hearing April 28.
“The loss of timely academic process alone is sufficient to establish irreparable harm,” Conley wrote. “Given the amount of Isserdasani’s educational expenses and potential losses from having to leave the United States without obtaining his degree, the court concludes that Isserdasani credibly demonstrates that he faces irreparable harm for which he has no adequate remedy at law in the absence of injunctive relief.” 
Since the termination earlier this month, Isserdasani has reported a significant psychological impact on him, according to the order, including “difficulty in sleeping and fear that he will be placed in immediate detention and deportation.” 
“He reports being afraid to leave his apartment for fear of being apprehended at any moment,” the order states.
According to the complaint, Isserdasani and his family have spent about $240,000 on his education in the country. He would lose $17,500 on the current semester’s tuition and would be responsible for four months of rent despite not being able to stay in the country, the complaint states.  
Isserdasani is represented by Madison lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who said in a statement to the Wisconsin State Journal that the “international students have done absolutely nothing wrong.” 
“They have followed U.S. laws and fully complied with the terms of their student status. They do not deserve this,” Lotfi said. “America must speak out against this injustice and not allow the Administration to distort the facts for their own political purposes.”
Isserdasani is one of dozens of students and alumni at University of Wisconsin institutions to have had their visas canceled by the federal government in recent weeks. There have been at least 26 at UW-Madison, 13 at UW-Milwaukee and several more at other campuses.
UW-Madison first announced cancellations on April 8, saying the university wasn’t notified by the government but had learned about them because staff has been reviewing federal databases every day to see whether students have been affected
According to the Associated Press, the Trump administration’s work to cancel visas has affected  at least 901 students at more than 128 colleges and universities nationwide. Some have been participants in protests about the war in Gaza, and others have had minor infractions, including traffic violations, according to published reports. 
Conley’s order indicates that Isserdasani appears to have had his visa canceled in relation to an arrest for disorderly conduct in November 2024 after he and friends got into an argument with other people while walking home from a bar one night. Madison District Attorney Ismael Ozanne declined to pursue charges after the arrest, and Isserdasani never had to appear in court and thought the issue was dealt with. He has had no other encounters with police, the order says. 
The university’s notification email that Isserdasani received stated that the reason given was “otherwise failing to maintain status” and he was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.” It said the termination “does not have a grace period to depart the U.S.” and that “employment benefits, including on-campus employment and any practical training you may have had authorized, end immediately when a SEVIS record is terminated. Therefore, you no longer have authorization to work in the United States.”
The order said Isserdasani “was given no warning, no opportunity to explain or defend himself and no chance to correct any potential misunderstanding.”
The judge’s order also covers the visa cancellation for Hamidreza Khademi, a 34-year-old citizen of Iran and graduate student at Iowa State University, who is also being represented by Lotfi.  Khademi graduated in December 2023, but was working in the country through a visa extension approved in 2024.
Khademi was arrested in February of 2024 and accused of evading arrest in a vehicle in Texas. However, the Texas Department of Public Safety eventually determined that there was no violation and decided against filing charges. His visa was terminated on April 10 and an email notifying him included similar reasoning as the one Isserdasani received. 
The judge reserved a ruling on the motion for a temporary restraining order for Khademi, pending further briefing by the parties, because he questioned whether the western Wisconsin court was the appropriate venue for the case. 
“Plaintiffs include no facts showing that venue is proper for the claims brought by Khademi, who appears to have no ties to the Western District of Wisconsin, nor do the events or omissions giving rise to his claims,” the judge wrote.

Josh Shapiro and other elected officials celebrate the opening of Hershey’s first fully-integrated digital manufacturing plant on April 16, 2025. (Commonwealth Media Services)The Hershey Company has marked the opening of their first new plant in its namesake community in more than three decades.
One of the world’s largest candymakers, the company is based in Hershey, Dauphin County. 
Several Pennsylvania elected officials were on hand Wednesday for the facility’s ribbon-cutting. Gov. Josh Shapiro lauded the Hershey Company as one of Pennsylvania’s great manufacturers.
“I think it is particularly good and meaningful for me to be here today, given the events of this past weekend, to celebrate the growth of this iconic company,” Shapiro said. “I know it’s easy to look at the world and see the people who are trying to tear things down. Today we’re here to celebrate a great company that is building things up and creating dreams and opportunity for so many people.”
Michele Buck, President and CEO of the Hershey Company, said the processing plant is the first new manufacturing facility constructed in Derry Township, outside Hershey, in more than 30 years. She also said it is the company’s  first fully digital integrated manufacturing facility with “high levels of automation, exemplifying the next step in our digital manufacturing roadmap.”
Shapiro said the new facility is going to create 125 new jobs in the state and thanked the company for having a “huge reach” from the farmlands to the corporate centers and beyond in Pennsylvania.

“It’s true that Hershey could have chosen to be anywhere for this new facility, but instead, they chose to invest a billion dollars to expand their footprint right here at home in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said. “That is a big deal. It is a point of pride for us, and we are grateful that you have doubled down on your commitment to Pennsylvania.”
“We’re very, very grateful for the jobs, for the commitment to this community and to this effort and to Milton Hershey’s legacy, which was not only about chocolate, but was about community, about philanthropy, about doing good for our community,” U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District), who represents Hershey.
State Sen. Patty Kim (D-15th District) and state Rep. Tom Mehaffie (R-106th District) represent Hershey in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly and were also on hand for the new facility’s opening.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)End-to-end encryption has made crimes against minors significantly harder to prosecute, legal experts say. Florida lawmakers plan to make social media companies cooperate with those investigations. 
The Sen. Blaise Ingoglia-introduced SB 868 is headed to the Senate floor after passing the Rules Committee Wednesday. Social media companies offering encrypted messaging are in opposition to the bill while state attorneys came to Tallahassee hoping the Legislature would make their jobs easier. 
Encrypted messages, those designed only to be read by the sender and receiver, not the owners of the platform it was sent on, are designed to prevent hackers or others acting in bad faith from accessing personal messages. 
Since end-to-end encryption has become widely-used, Ingoglia said, social media companies have told prosecutors they have no records to provide toward convicting “nefarious” actors in child pornography and drug trafficking cases.
“As you know, there are extremely bad actors online targeting minors with sexually explicit and sexually suggestive materials,” Ingoglia said. “Encryption, used by social media companies, makes it more challenging if not impossible for law enforcement to retrieve the proof necessary to put these guys behind bars.”
The bill would require social media companies to de-crypt messages if subpoenaed by a court and prohibit minors from using messages that are designed to disappear.
Popular apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger offer end-to-end encryption.
NetChoice, a tech association representing some of the largest social platforms, contest the bill, saying it is “well intentioned” but “fundamentally undermines the core purpose of encryption.”
“Creating an encryption backdoor is fraught with privacy and security risks,” NetChoice stated on its website.  
Rep. Michelle Salzman is sponsor of the House version, HB 743, which must pass the Commerce Committee before receiving a floor vote. 
“I shared with all the social media companies that came to see me that we are going to put the safety of Floridians first and them second, and either they can get on board and look good or they can just stand there and fight and lose,” Salzman told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’re not going to stop here. This bill will pass this year and we’re going to continue the momentum.”
This bill is another in lawmakers’ effort to protect minors online.
Minors younger than 14-years-old will be prohibited from using social media if the state successfully defends its 2024 law that also requires parental consent for 14-and-15-year-olds to use social media platforms with addictive features. NetChoice filed suit against the state on that 2024 law, HB 3.
“So, just think if you were a parent, and you know that your child is being groomed by somebody online, and the child is now being pressured to give nude photos or create child pornography for the purpose of transmitting over,” Ingoglia said. 
“And you went to a state’s attorney or a prosecutor and they tried and they gave the subpoena or the warrant and the social media came back and they said, ‘Hey we have nothing.’”
Ingoglia said he does not think social media companies are behaving in good faith.
“Under any other section of law when it comes to prosecuting, somebody who destroys evidence will be put away,” Ingoglia said. “But social media companies though their algorithms and through their coding are allowed to destroy evidence all the time.” 
State Attorney Amira Fox, prosecuting in Charlotte, Collier, Glades, Hendry, and Lee counties, stood beside Salzman and Ingoglia Wednesday in hopes the bill will pass.  
“Social media platforms have made it very difficult for prosecutors,” Fox said, adding that end-to-end encryption has attracted people who want to use it for illegal purposes. 
Fox said compared to the beginning of her career, social media have boosted the number of cases involving child predators.
“We have spent years putting together task forces to tackle human trafficking and child abuse, and now we’re met with, when we send our subpoenas and our search warrants to these social media companies … we get back ‘no material exists,’ because they’ve encrypted it,” Fox said during a news conference Wednseday afternoon at the Capitol.
Fox said the lawmakers’ bill is a “great bill to stand up to this.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House voted 55-37 on Wednesday in favor of a bill that some worry will lead to state employees paying health insurance premiums — though supporters say that is not the intention of the proposal.
Senate Bill 2160 would move the state’s insurance to a plan that offers benefits compliant with the federal Affordable Care Act.
Proponents say it will give the state more flexibility over plan designs, which are limited under the current plan.
This could save the state money at no extra cost to employees, said Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton, the bill’s sponsor. Savings are especially important in light of rising health care costs, he added.
North Dakota lawmakers consider bill that could lead to state employees paying for health premiums

The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday forwarded the bill with a 15-7 do-pass recommendation. 
The bill is expected to cost $6.6 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, plus an additional more than $25 million for the 2027-2029 biennium, according to a fiscal analysis attached to the bill.
One of the biggest concerns voiced by critics is that the state would be able to start charging employees premiums. The state may be tempted to do so to offset the additional cost of the plan, opponents said. Under the current plan, the state cannot charge premiums.
Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the bill does not force premiums on employees and there’s no reason the state would need to in the future. The state would not have to charge employees premiums in order for the plan to be Affordable Care Act-compliant.
“I have no intention of charging a premium to the state employees,” Koppelman said.
During committee discussion, however, some lawmakers did indicate they’d like to see state employees contribute to health insurance.
Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, said that changing the plan is taking a big risk without assurance employees will prefer it. He said it’s not clear that the plan will save money.
People often take jobs with the state government for the benefits and stability, he argued.

Warrey said Senate Bill 2160 would also give employees more free benefits, such as preventive health care like colonoscopy screening and mammograms. It would allow co-pays to count toward out-of-pocket maximums.
Rep. Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, said that if employees take advantage of preventive care services the cost of the state plan will go down over time. They’ll be able to address health conditions before they become more severe and more costly, he reasoned.
According to Kasper, who said he has worked in employee benefits for 25 years, the private sector moved to Affordable Care-Act compliant plans long ago because they offer more flexibility. 
“Grandfathered plans in my opinion are like dinosaurs,” Kasper said.
If the state saves money by changing the plan, it could reallocate those extra funds into raising wages for employees, said Koppelman. This could be positive for recruitment and retention, he said.
“Young individuals are looking for more dollars in the check,” Koppelman said.
Some state agencies have come out in opposition to the plan, Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, noted on the floor. 
The Office of Management and Budget, for example, has said that employees consider the current health plan an important benefit and worry about the new plan impacting North Dakota’s ability to attract state workers. The agency has also expressed concerns about how the state will fund the plan.
Schauer said the state should seek more thorough data about the proposal, including what an Affordable Care Act-compliant plan would cost and how many employees support the change.
The bill represents a “huge decision that needs to be studied with input from all stakeholders,” Schauer said.
The bill is expected to go to the Senate next for a concurrence vote.

,DC,2025-04-16 21:26:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,RFK Jr. to refocus federal autism research on environmental factors,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-refocus-federal-autism-research-environmental-factors,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday the department will shift its research into autism toward potential environmental causes, though he declined to say exactly what the Trump administration would do if certain industries or pollutants were found responsible.Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no medical or research training, declared that autism is a preventable disease, argued research into genetic causes is a “dead end” and asserted that “we know it’s environmental exposure,” before saying HHS would fund “a series of new studies to identify precisely what the environmental toxins are that are causing it.”“This has not been done before,” Kennedy said. “We’re going to do it in a thorough and comprehensive way and we’re going to get back with an answer to the American people very, very quickly.”Kennedy said during his first press conference since receiving Senate confirmation that he wanted researchers to look into numerous potential factors, including mold, food additives, pesticides, air, water, medicines, ultrasound, age of parents, obesity in parents and diabetes in parents.He pledged to have “some of the answers by September,” though he added the research will “be an evolving process.”Kennedy appeared confident in his personal assessment that environmental factors lead to autism, without attributing that belief to any one industry or contaminant.“This is coming from an environmental toxin and somebody made a profit by putting that environmental toxin into our air, our water, our medicines, our food,” Kennedy said. “And it’s to their benefit to normalize it, to say, ‘This is all normal. It has always been here.’ But that’s not good for our country.”Autism experts, however, cast doubt on Kennedy’s assertion that environmental factors lead to autism and questioned his proposed timeline to prove such a link.When asked by a reporter what exactly the Trump administration would do if research found conclusive evidence that one specific industry or pollutant was causing autism, Kennedy didn’t say whether HHS would push to ban it or close down any businesses. “I think we’re going to figure out a way to make pressure on them to remove it,” he said. “I think also there will be market forces that also exert pressure on them to remove it.”Research difficultCatherine Lord, professor of psychiatry with the school of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said during an interview with States Newsroom following Kennedy’s remarks that trying to reach a definitive cause of autism before September was an ""utterly ridiculous” timeline.Lord said “the most likely hypothesis is that there may be interactions between genetics and, for example, environmental exposures, or even experiences like extreme prematurity.”But she noted that studying the impact of environmental contaminants on people’s health, or a complex diagnosis like autism, is challenging because scientists obviously cannot expose people to toxins.“It's so difficult to do that work well, and people do it, but they can't do it quickly,” Lord said. “And so I think that we do need work in that area, and I think it has been funded in the last few years. It just hasn't come out with anything that is earth-shattering. It's more the same thing, which is that if you're exposed to something bad, your chances of having a child with any kind of neurodevelopmental disorder is going to go up.”Lord expressed concern about moving funding and research away from genetic factors, saying “we do know that autism is genetic, so I think that is not under question.”“I think the genetic work was moving forward,” she said. “It's a slow pace, again, because they're addressing so many different genetic patterns. But I think that at least there's clear progress within this science.”Limits funding for genetic researchEric Fombonne, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Oregon Health and Sciences University, said during an interview that it was unwise for Kennedy to say there would be some answers about autism within a few months.“It's ridiculous to say that he's going to unravel the etiology of autism in six months,” Fombonne said. “I mean, he could give, like, all the money of the world to any lab or any person. They could never report any results before several years from now, at the minimum.”The pace of medical research, he said, is slow and Kennedy’s comments show “a complete ignorance and disregard for science and what we do and how complicated it is and the time it takes.”Directing research dollars toward possible environmental contributors to autism will also limit the amount of funding available for genetic research, which Fombonne said “has been incredibly productive.”“The pie is limited,” Fombonne said. “So if you move funds from genetic research to environmental research, you're going to slow down the pace of genetic research.”Fombonne explained that research into genetics and autism is “quite complicated” and has shown that not all genetic mechanisms are “the same across different families.”“So it's a very complex puzzle. And as you know, the brain is a very hard organ to study. So understanding the pathophysiology, which is associated with these gene variants, is a very hard process,” he said. “But we are doing that and we are progressing. And this has been paying off enormously over the last 20 or 30 years.”Fombonne wouldn’t make the same assessment of potential environmental factors, saying there are no signs of higher rates of autism in certain areas or certain time periods, like scientists have found for some other conditions.“There is no evidence that there is a cluster of cases of kids who have been living in a polluted area, or exposed to particular environmental circumstances,” Fombonne said. “There is no starting point, which is strong, to start environmental research somewhere we can say is going to pay off.“So it's going to be very exploratory initially, which may be a good thing to do. But at least, let's do it well, and most of the studies so far are short.”",,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Majority Leader Scott Odenbach waved his hand behind him, gesturing to the lawmakers’ lobby just a few paces beyond his desk on the House floor.
“I would ask anyone in this room to walk right out the doors here and see the plaster crumbling and running down the walls,” the Spearfish Republican said in late February.
He was speaking in support of a bill to restore, maintain and repair South Dakota’s Capitol building. Lawmakers approved $3 million, growing the pool of funds set aside during the past six years for Capitol building and grounds projects to nearly $12 million. About $9 million remains unspent.
Signs of disrepair from age and neglect are scattered throughout the 115-year-old building, from that chipping plaster to cracked paint and water damage. There are also concerns about Capitol Lake, fed by a well once thought to be a sinkhole risk and adorned with a Flaming Fountain that no longer flames.

As the list of projects grows, the state official in charge of maintaining the complex is considering a full renovation of the building and trying to solve the puzzle of the lake’s future.
Board approves $1.2 million restoration and renovation study
The citizen board that oversees Capitol restoration projects approved a plan Wednesday to divide $3 million among three projects:

Up to $500,000 on plaster repair and paint in public spaces.
$1.3 million to restore the Capitol dome.
$1.2 million to map out a plan for a full restoration and renovation of the rest of the Capitol building.

The plaster and paint needs are immediate, but Commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration Darin Seeley said walls torn down to address potential infrastructure repairs might make painting more than necessary now a waste of taxpayer dollars.
A 2023 study by the bureau found plumbing, heating and cooling, and electrical code violations throughout the building due to its age — some piping is original to the building’s 1910 construction. The estimated cost to fix those issues at the time was $75 million.
“As appreciative as I am of the $3 million appropriation, it’s really important we don’t spend $3 million just to spend $3 million and then tear it back apart,” Seeley told members of the Capitol Complex Restoration and Beautification Commission.
The bureau wants to restore the Capitol dome to give South Dakotans an “introduction” to what a full restoration would look like, Seeley said. That could help with fundraising efforts if the state decides to pursue a full restoration and renovation.

The structural changes and further renovations Seeley envisions will likely require private sector dollars, Fort Pierre Republican Rep. Will Mortenson told South Dakota Searchlight, which is “an entirely different conversation.”
The $3 million Mortenson pushed for this year is intended to fix the “glaring needs” inside the Capitol.
The dome work will include repairing damaged plaster, repainting the walls, replacing lights on an arch near the grand staircase and installing lights on the dome ledges to highlight the decoration and detail inside.
The legislative budget committee sent a letter of intent to Seeley in March, requesting an annual report until the newly appropriated $3 million is spent. The report will detail each project, its rationale, cost and timeline.
Plaster repair will begin this year, while dome restoration work on site will begin next April after the end of legislative session.
Capitol Lake improvements no longer an ‘emergency’
Doubt surfaced among some lawmakers this session about the need for more money when taxpayers have yet to see many results from past funding.
About three-fourths of the $12 million in funding is devoted to the grounds, and for Capitol Lake, which is fed by an uncapped, free-flowing well more than 1,300 feet deep. The well was drilled in 1910 by Peter Norbeck, who led the Norbeck Drilling Company before serving as South Dakota governor and a U.S. senator. The well produces not only water around 95 degrees Fahrenheit for the lake but also natural gas, which was diverted to light and heat the Capitol for decades before it caused an explosion in 1958.
The gas flowed reliably enough for years afterward to light a flame atop the flowing water that came to be known as the Flaming Fountain. But by 2008, the gas sputtered. A 2019 report by a team from South Dakota Mines said the underground pocket of natural gas was probably almost depleted, and that the well’s steel casing could be corroded and in danger of a sinkhole-inducing collapse that would make it difficult to stem the flow of water.
After that, state officials began planning to replace the lake’s water source.

Seeley told South Dakota Searchlight the state has until July 2027 to spend about $3.9 million in legislatively appropriated funds on lake improvements, due to a spending deadline in state law. A $2 million lake grant from the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources remains unspent as well. The grant is intended to help establish an alternative water source for the lake, and to conserve water by pumping it from the lake to water the Capitol complex green space. The plan would conserve more than 8 million gallons to water 40 acres.
About $3 million has been spent on the lake so far. The money was used to study the well, plan an alternative water source and dredge the lake. The dredging cost about $2.6 million, according to a contract with Morris Construction Enterprise.
The bureau is waiting to spend the remaining lake funds because it discovered that the situation with the well isn’t as urgent as feared, Seeley said. Engineering and design firm Snyder and Associates tested the water quality and inspected the bottom of the well via camera last year.
“We don’t have an emergency,” Seeley said. “I don’t want to waste money, so we’re stepping back to consider the bigger picture.”
The well as it currently stands is not a viable long-term water source for the lake, Seeley said. The report said that although the well is in “relatively good condition,” it is constructed of “unverified and obsolete materials,” isn’t in compliance with modern design standards and “likely surpassed its expected design life.”

Replacement options include restoring the existing well and controlling the water flow, drilling a new well on the site and using a reverse osmosis system to improve the lake’s water quality, or piping water from the nearby Missouri River.
Because the warm well water keeps the lake from freezing over, thousands of Canada geese — the unofficial Capitol mascot — inhabit and leave droppings in and around the lake year-round, leading to poor water quality. Stormwater runoff compounds the problem, according to Snyder and Associates, which helped dredge the lake in 2023. Some new water sources, such as transporting Missouri River water, would allow the lake to freeze over in the winter, removing the geese and droppings for part of the year.
The return of a Flaming Fountain is questionable. The options to replace the lake’s water source don’t involve finding a new source of natural gas in the old location. While a new Flaming Fountain of some form is proposed for the Capitol Lake conceptual design, “the flame as it was known cannot return,” a bureau spokesman said in an email.
Lakota Code Talker Memorial has a ‘whole bunch’ of fundraising left
Mortenson carried bills to improve the Capitol Lake and the Capitol building during the 2023 and 2025 legislative sessions. He expected the 2023 funding would not only go toward replacing the lake’s water source but toward sitework for a Sioux Code Talker Memorial to honor “some of South Dakota’s most worthy heroes.”

The Sioux Code Talker Memorial is a planned site at Capitol Lake to honor Lakota, Dakota and Nakota code talkers who served in World Wars I and II. More than two hundred tribal members from South Dakota served in the military, using their native language to communicate during battle without enemy forces cracking the code.
The memorial will include a wall of names for Oceti Sakowin code talkers and two bronze sculptures created by Sioux Falls-based sculptor Darwin Wolf. The memorial’s donation drive is open on the South Dakota Community Foundation website. Robert Dunsmore, tribal service officer for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a member of the code talker fundraising committee, said the group has “a whole bunch” of fundraising left.
The Bureau of Human Resources and Administration will “have a role to play” in ensuring “access to the approved site” when the fundraising is ready, a department spokesman said in a statement.
 



Money for Capitol projects
2019: The Legislature allowed the Bureau of Administration to spend $200,000 in private funding to study the Flaming Fountain (which no longer burns) at Capitol Lake.
2022: The Legislature appropriated $500,000 in general funds and $3 million in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to the Bureau of Administration to develop a master plan for Capitol Lake, to plug the existing well and improve the lake water quality.

(File/Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Up to 15,000 K-12 students could receive $7,500 scholarships next year for private school tuition under a compromise between the House and Senate that seeks to reinstate and expand payments halted by the state Supreme Court.
After pushback from Democrats over not having enough time to read and fully consider the changes, senators decided to postpone a vote on returning the amended bill to the House.
But that’s just a timing issue. Democrats don’t have the votes to stop advancement.
For the coming school year, eligibility would continue to be capped at 10,000 students whose parents earn up to 300% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, for example, the income limit would be $96,450.
Eligibility would then max out in 2026-27 at 15,000 students living in households with incomes up to 500% of the poverty line. Under 2025 guidelines, the income limit would be nearly $161,000 for a family of four.
The compromise, adopted 29-13 mostly along party lines, was a deal cut between Senate and House education chairs, said Senate Education Chairman Greg Hembree.
No Democrat voted for it. Two Republicans voted against it: Sen. Shane Martin of Spartanburg County and Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey of Edgefield, who said the proposed expansion could result in higher-income parents taking most of the slots.
The Edgefield Republican, whose children attend public schools, has consistently said the idea was to help children stuck in failing schools whose parents couldn’t afford any other option — not as a state bonus for well-off parents already paying for private tuition.
Republican leadership named the issue a top priority this year after the state Supreme Court struck down the private tuition payments last September as unconstitutional. Nearly 800 students have since been relying on private donors to pay their tuition this school year.
SC Senate passes K-12 voucher bill pulling from lottery profits

Typically, when the House and Senate pass differing versions of a proposal, the chambers will send the legislation to a six-member panel — consisting of three legislators from each chamber — to hammer out the differences. But reaching a compromise through that process would have been difficult and might have held up the bill, said Hembree, R-Little River.
So, he met with House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort, and officials with the state Department of Education to figure out a middle ground, Hembree said.
“The bones of the bill remain pretty much the same,” he said.
SC House passes bill to revive K-12 vouchers. The bulk of this year’s money will go unused.

The deal would give students who are in public school and below 300% of federal poverty guidelines priority through early application windows, Hembree said.
The Legislature would also have the option of increasing the number of slots by allocating more money in the budget, he said.
Each student would receive a set $7,500 scholarship for the school year, rather than an amount that would adjust depending on state aid to public schools.
That money could come from either the lottery fund or the state’s general fund. The thinking is that the state’s high court will find one of the two options constitutional in the expected next legal challenge, Hembree said.
The money would go to students through a third-party “trustee,” a position the House added in an effort to circumvent the state constitution’s ban on public dollars directly benefiting private education.
“In my view, this is an insurance policy,” Hembree said.
The idea of a trustee raised immediate alarms for Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews.
“What guarantee do we have to the taxpayers of this state that when we let go of that money, we have any control of it whatsoever?” Ott said.
That was just what he noticed on a cursory glance. The proposal could contain more concerns upon closer examination, he said.
“That’s what should be concerning to everyone, that I have been able to find those questions in a matter of 30 minutes,” Ott said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hembree-1024x873.jpg,,,2025-04-16 18:09:41.757591

The state Senate passed a bill Tuesday attempting to stop habitual speeders in their tracks.
Passed on a 40-8 vote, House Bill 1596 would require certain drivers to install an “intelligent speed assistance” device that limits their car to the posted speed limit of the area they are in. Drivers with the device would be allowed to exceed the speed limit up to three times a month.
Similar to how ignition interlock devices are mandated for people with a history of drunk driving, a person would have a speed limiter if they get a restricted license that requires one, during a probation period after getting their license suspended for reckless driving or excessive speeding, or if they have been ordered to have a device by a court.
“Installing intelligent speed assistance devices in vehicles will guarantee that drivers physically cannot exceed the speed limit,” said Sen. John Lovick, D-Mill Creek, during the floor debate.
“It is also a reminder to the drivers of their dangerous driving behavior, and hopefully will serve as a tool for lasting behavior change,” he added.
“We’re losing family members, we’re losing lost souls to those who are intentionally choosing to drive fast. And this will provide an opportunity to save our neighbors and increase our public safety,” said prime sponsor Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place, after the bill passed.
Leavitt pointed to state data showing fatal car crashes have been on an upward trend since 2019, with a growing number of them involving speeding.
She was particularly moved by a crash in King County last March that killed 38-year-old Andrea Smith and three children. A man was accused of causing the crash by driving well over 100 miles an hour in a 40 mph zone. He pleaded guilty earlier this month.









The bill was titled “The BEAM Act” in honor of those who died in the crash.
“BEAM is an acronym for the first letter of the first name of the four who died last March in Renton, so Boyd, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda,” Leavitt explained.
Eight Republicans ultimately voted against the legislation. Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, said while he supports the intent of stopping habitual speeders, he had concerns about oversight and monitoring “creeping into others” with one or two isolated incidents.
“There could be an instance where you have to speed, a medical emergency where something is happening – maybe your wife’s having a baby and you’re exceeding the speed limit and then you get caught like that,” he said.
The bill will go back to the House to concur with amendments made in the Senate before heading over to the governor.
“I’ve heard from the governor’s office that they’re very excited about this bill and about the ability to save lives,” Leavitt said. “So I’m feeling very confident that we’ll get it over the finish line this year.”

SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois House gave its approval to legislation that would give high school athletes a limited right to compete in non-school events or on non-school teams during the same season in which they play for their school.

The House voted 68-39 on April 9 to pass a scaled-back version of a bill known as the Right to Play Act. It would partially override an existing rule of the Illinois High School Association that says students who participate on a school team may not also participate on a non-school team or compete in outside tournaments or events in the same sport during the same season, unless they obtain permission from both their school and IHSA.

The association currently allows students to obtain as many as three waivers in a season to compete in outside contests or tournaments if those events are sanctioned by the sport’s national governing body.

Rep. Janet Yang-Rohr, D-Naperville, said she thinks that rule is too restrictive because it doesn’t allow for events sponsored by international sports organizations.

“Our athletes right now in Illinois have to decline invitations from FIFA (the international soccer governing body), from the Olympic development program, from offers to play with national teams in Canada and Scotland, because these IHSA rules compel the organization to deny their waiver requests,” she said on the House floor. “This legislation will finally be able to let those student athletes participate in those events too.”

Under the amended bill, student athletes would be able to obtain waivers for as many as two outside events per year, including “all-star team” events. But they would only need the agreement of their school’s principal or athletics director, not IHSA. The bill also would not require the events to be sanctioned by any official governing body.

That is significantly more restrictive than the original bill, which would have removed the prohibition on simultaneous participation almost entirely. It would have prohibited participating in both a school competition or practice and a non-school activity on the same day.

That proposal passed out of the House Education Policy Committee in March, despite warnings from some critics that allowing unrestricted dual participation could endanger the health and safety of the athletes while also setting up the possibility of conflict between a school coach and non-school coach.

But Rep. Martin McLaughlin, R-Barrington Hills, who voted for the amended bill, said during floor debate that he would have preferred going even further in limiting the authority of IHSA.

“This is an unfortunate turn with your amendments, but I completely appreciate … what you had to do to get this started,” he said during floor debate. “But frankly, let's next year – and I'll join you – get this completely wiped out. Get the IHSA back in the lane where they should be, which is to be fair and to allow all these students to have every equal opportunity for scholarships that they can get.”

IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said in an email Wednesday that the association still opposes the proposed legislation because it puts principals and athletic directors in charge of deciding whether a student should be granted a waiver.

“It’s my understanding that the schools prefer a process whereby review of such participation is considered by the Association to create equity in opportunities across the membership,” Anderson said.

The bill now awaits further action in the Senate.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) A coalition of labor unions submitted 320,000 signatures in support of a referendum to overturn a controversial union bill on Wednesday. If their numbers are right, it’s the most signatures ever gathered for a referendum in Utah. 
It’s the latest in a monthslong saga related to HB267, a controversial law passed this legislative session that prohibits public unions from collective bargaining. 
Now, a group of 20 unions called the Protect Utah Workers coalition is one step closer to handing the issue over to voters through a ballot referendum, where citizens can vote on new laws, or repeal existing ones, during elections. 
Forcing a referendum in Utah is no walk in the park. Per state code, a group has 30 days to gather signatures from 8% of Utah voters, including 8% of the voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts.

That 8% figure roughly equates to 141,000 signatures. The announcement of 320,000 signatures Wednesday shatters that threshold, making the effort to overturn HB267 one of the most successful in state history. 
“We are on track to become not only the most successful citizen-led referendum in Utah history, but one of the most successful in our nation’s history,” said John Arthur, a sixth grade teacher at Meadowlark Elementary School in Salt Lake City. “We didn’t just meet our goal, we doubled it.” 
Arthur spoke on Wednesday during a media event outside the Salt Lake County Government building, after the coalition turned over boxes containing thousands of signature packets to County Clerk Lannie Chapman’s office. 
“It’s certainly the biggest referendum effort I’ve ever seen,” Chapman said after the media event. For reference, a successful tax reform referendum in 2020 gathered about 155,000 signatures. 
Chapman’s team now has 21 days to verify the packets and confirm the signatures come from registered voters who live in Salt Lake County — the same goes for county clerks around the state. Once verified, the voter’s name will be made publicly available, opening a 45-day window where the voter can choose to rescind their support for the referendum, if they choose.

When the county clerks are done, the lieutenant governor’s office will then review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 General Election.
It’s likely some of the signatures will be deemed invalid — some people may have signed twice, aren’t registered to vote, gave an incorrect address, or have illegible handwriting. 
Plus, groups like the Utah chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative policy and advocacy organization, have launched their own campaign in support of HB267. Called “Decline to Sign,” the group will continue to advocate against the referendum during the 45-day window where voters can retract their signatures. 
But with a cushion of almost 180,000 signatures, the coalition is feeling confident the fate of HB267 will be left to voters. 
“Politicians came after public workers and the public got to work,” said Arthur. “Now the people of Utah will get to decide what kind of state we’re going to be.” 



Let us know what you think...


 


Signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in February, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
Come July, a teachers union will no longer be allowed to negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees. 
Lawmakers say the bill will protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. If a teachers union only represents one third of the employees in a school district, it shouldn’t be able to negotiate employment contracts on behalf of everyone, said the bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy. 
Currently, just Salt Lake City’s police and fire departments, and a handful of the state’s school districts, have unions that engage in collective bargaining. 
“More than 99% of all the (public) unions that currently exist today do not do collective bargaining,” said Cullimore earlier this year. “All the services that they provide their members, the services they provide employees, all the education and training that they do, will still be available.”
But labor groups and members of the public were staunchly opposed to the bill, which narrowly passed out of the Legislature. That opposition morphed into the Protect Utah Workers coalition — among them are the Utah State Fraternal Order of Police, the Utah Education Association, Professional Firefighters of Utah, Teamsters Local 222, the Salt Lake Valley Law Enforcement Association, United Mine Workers and more. 
“To the sponsors and supporters of HB267, you are not representing the best interest of public employees or your constituents,” said Kevin Murray, president of the Utah State Fraternal Order of Police. “The groundswell of support we’ve seen during this signature gathering event makes one thing clear— this community stands united, and we will be heard.”

The organizations behind the signature effort hope to place a referendum on Utah ballots that would undo controversial legislation restricting collective bargaining for public sector employees including teachers and first responders.

Since the effort began on March 15, roughly 5,000 union members and volunteers have hit the streets, gathering signatures at coffee shops, grocery stores, museums, college campuses, congressional town halls, bus stops, tattoo parlors, TRAX stations, sporting events and protests. Over 30 days, they collected nearly 10,600 signatures each day. 
“This is what solidarity looks like, a coalition of 19 labor unions came together: firefighters, police officers, educators, nurses, miners, food workers, all in support of this. We knocked doors, hosted events, braved bad weather just to spread the word. And we could not have done it without everyone who stepped up,” said Donnavan Minutes, a firefighter for Salt Lake City.

Like many Colorado turkey (and other) hunters, I depend on public lands for hunting, hiking, camping, canoeing and outdoor recreation in general. More importantly, wildlife species like deer, ducks, grouse, elk and dozens more need that habitat for their survival.
With more than 23 million acres of public land, Colorado boasts some of the best hunting access in the nation. Here you can hunt national forests, state wildlife areas, state parks, state trust and Bureau of Land Management lands. Hunting mountain Merriam’s turkeys in Colorado epitomizes the spirit of fair chase in vast expanses of public lands terrain.
Combined with the 640 million acres of federal public lands in the United States, our nation’s hunters and anglers have unparalleled opportunities to pursue fish and game without relying upon private landowners for access. However, sportsmen and women cite lack of access as the No. 1 obstacle to continuing our sporting traditions. Without these public lands hunters will be next on the endangered species list.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Surveys by the Congressional Sportsmen Foundation have found that over 90% of Colorado hunters use public lands. Public lands habitat is the Titanic that keeps hunting afloat, but it’s sinking. People have been trying to steal our great public lands estate since Theodore Roosevelt (and others) set it aside. Unfortunately, those efforts have shifted into high gear recently. After his February confirmation, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a series of orders prioritizing public lands energy development and mining.
Kaden McArthur, policy and government relations director for Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, said Burgum’s orders discount input from hunters, anglers and other stakeholders. Then, in March, Burgum proposed fixing America’s affordable housing problem by selling off public lands for development, Outdoor Life news editor Dac Collins explained.
In reality, it’s a thinly veiled disguise to dispose of public lands. And as sportsmen and women know from boots-on-the-ground experience, nothing locks up land like privatization. “This is just one step of many that we’ve seen toward the commodification and development of our public lands,” McArthur told Outdoor Life.
“This idea that our federal lands are a cure-all to the nation’s housing problems is a farce,” Collins added. “The root cause of the affordable housing crisis is a lack of affordable units, not a lack of developable land.”
In addition, the vast majority of federal lands are far removed from the metropolitan areas where affordable housing is most needed. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are currently 15.1 million vacant housing units in the United States, reinforcing the idea that housing availability is not the main issue.
A July 2023 News Tribune op-ed noted that institutional buyers — companies, corporations or limited liability companies — made up 13% of the residential real estate sales market in 2021. Cory Ure, at SecurityNational Mortgage Co. in Salt Lake City, was quoted as saying, “Even some very qualified buyers couldn’t compete against these investors, especially these big pension funds and hedge funds coming in and paying way over value.”
Collins says the federal government could play a big role in making housing more affordable by enacting policies that bring down housing costs, such as preventing corporations and private equity firms from buying up single-family homes, and incentivizing the construction of affordable homes over luxury apartments and high-end subdivisions.
“As sportsmen and women, we must remain vigilant. Once public land is sold, it’s lost forever,” McArthur added. “We shouldn’t trade an irreplaceable resource — our public lands — for irreversible development.” This is why BHA strongly supports the bipartisan Public Lands in Public Hands Act, which would reduce the ability for federal land management agencies to dispose of the lands owned by all Americans.
Many of us come from multi-generational families of hunters and/or military veterans and, as such, we have embraced the immense responsibility of protecting public lands and democracy. Diminishing any wild public lands, waters and wildlife anywhere speaks to a fundamental disregard for the hunters, anglers, and the servicemembers and veterans of this great nation.
Public lands are not a left or right issue, they’re an American issue.
“To be clear: Once these landscapes are gone and out of the federal estate, they’re never coming back,” McArthur emphasized.
And I didn’t spend 15 years of my life in military training and service to let a bunch of billionaire buzzards and oligarch wannabes waltz in and take them without a fight. At BHA we’re not backing down.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) said Wednesday the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program is “on life support,” adding that some of his Republican colleagues give it a 20% chance of being extended in this year’s budget debate before its expiration next year. 
Kurtz, Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine), Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Secretary Karen Hyun spoke Wednesday to a gathering of members of local Audubon Society chapters and staff of Audubon Great Lakes ahead of the organization’s advocacy day to lobby legislators to support conservation funding. 
The Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program was established in 1989 to help preserve local natural environments. Throughout its history, the program has enjoyed mostly bipartisan support as it has provided grants through the DNR to help local governments and nonprofits fund the acquisition, restoration and maintenance of public land, parks and wildlife habitats. 
In recent years, the program has become a flashpoint in the fight over the boundary between the executive and legislative branches of state government. Until a decision by the state Supreme Court last year, any member of the Legislature’s powerful Joint Committee on Finance had the authority to hold up a project funded through the stewardship program by placing an anonymous hold on that spending. 
The Court’s decision entirely removed the Legislature’s oversight of the program, a change that further turned Republicans against its continued existence. 
“We could make that process better, where it was not just one individual not liking something and being able to kill a project. I agree with that,” Kurtz said. “When the court case came in and basically took that entire process away, that was not good either, because there was no oversight. And I understand some of you believe whatever the DNR does is fine. That’s great. Some of my colleagues don’t believe that.”
Especially in the northern part of the state, Republicans have objected to stewardship funds being used to conserve land that then gets taken off of local property tax rolls — taking money away from already struggling small local governments. In other cases, Republicans have complained that proposals for projects under the grants rely too heavily on the state funds without the local governments providing enough of their own money. 
In his proposed 2025-26 budget, Gov. Tony Evers has requested the stewardship program be increased from its current funding of $33 million per year to $100 million per year for 10 years. 
Kurtz said he’s working on a bill that would return some oversight authority over the program to the Legislature without the anonymous objection provision. He added, though,  that if the Audubon members went to Republicans Wednesday saying, “‘It’s the governor’s budget or nothing,’ you already lost.” 
“I don’t need you to do that, because, I’m being very sincere, I’m trying to keep this alive, and if you go over there [saying that], there’s a good chance it’ll die,” he said. “So don’t do that. Let them, especially when you’re meeting with my colleagues, ask them what [their] concerns are. ‘Why don’t you like this? What is it about the program that we can do better so we can have another day to make sure we protect all our wonderful birds and animals.’”
Habush Sinykin noted that 93% of Wisconsinites support the program and said that in her purple district covering Milwaukee’s northwest suburbs, the stewardship program is hugely popular. She said the anonymous hold of a project in the district drew the ire of community members of both parties. 
“There’s a lot of understanding at the legislative level that in these uncertain times, with these newer maps, that our state representatives and senators, including those on the Joint Finance Committee, have to be wary and strategic about issues like this that are bipartisan,” she said. “They’re actually non-partisan. They are successful community building issues. So I think that’s a little bit where your leverage is to lean in hard. How popular these are.”
Aside from the stewardship program, the society members lobbying in the Capitol Wednesday were pushing for the state to increase protections for wetlands and grasslands, advance sustainable practices in the state’s agriculture and forestry industries and grow renewable energy production. 
On Wednesday morning, the administration of President Donald Trump announced a proposed rule that would rescind habitat protections for endangered species across the country. 
Marnie Urso, Audubon Great Lakes’ senior director of policy, said that with the federal government retreating from conservation efforts, state level efforts have become more important. 
“With that uncertainty, this kind of work is even more important, for state lawmakers to be on the path to conserving our natural resources,” Urso said. “The Knowles Nelson project program is bipartisan. It always has been a permanent foundation. So we know it has wide, widespread bipartisan support.”
Urso said leaning into that popularity could help advance the group’s priorities. 
“Even Trump voters like the Knowles Nelson Conservation Fund,” she said. “So we’re confident that by coming and talking, telling our story and getting to understand what’s important to our lawmakers, we can inform those decisions. And now it’s more important than ever to have state conservation programs continue.”

(Sarah Jane Tribble/KFF Health News)Louisiana students who qualify for TOPS tuition awards but attend college out of state could still get that money if they decide to return home for medical or dental school. The legislature is considering a measure to lure them back home, but with conditions.
House Bill 275 by Rep. Stephanie Berault, R-Slidell, would require those students to pay back the aid unless they work full time in their field in Louisiana for at least three consecutive years after graduation. 
The proposal is aimed at addressing a physician shortage in Louisiana, where the Cicero Institute reports 60 out of 64 parishes have a shortage of health care professionals. 
The bill has the support of Gov. Jeff Landry and was unanimously approved Wednesday by the House Education Committee. 
TOPS, short for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, is a merit-based scholarship program that helps Louisiana students attend in-state colleges and universities.
About 34 new medical and dental school students each year will qualify for TOPS under the legislation, according to a cost estimate for the bill. The cost will gradually increase over four years, when it is forecasted to level out at about $1.3 million annually. 
Berault has also proposed House Bill 539, which would create a student loan repayment program for doctors who practice in Louisiana’s rural areas. It has not yet been scheduled for a hearing.

(Photo by Creatas/ Getty Images Plus)Lawmakers held a public hearing Wednesday afternoon for a bipartisan proposal to protect people who enter into an agreement to hold firearms for someone else. 
Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden) introduced the legislation during a public hearing with the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee that included three other bills about hold agreements, secure storage and keeping firearms in unoccupied vehicles. Earlier in the day, the committee also heard proposals to repeal the state’s 72-hour waiting period and background check requirement for private sales. 
This is the second wave of gun legislation before the committee this session. The committee already rejected proposals to amend Maine’s concealed carry laws, while legislation seeking to address large-capacity magazines divided Democrats. 
Gun rights advocates were largely supportive of the bills regarding hold agreements, so long as they were voluntary agreements, but pushed back on the storage proposals with concerns that they penalize law-abiding citizens and victims of crimes. 
Under a firearms hold agreement, LD 1104 would offer legal protection for the person who agrees to hold a firearm for someone else. The legislation would give the holder immunity after the firearm is returned, unless their conduct is otherwise unlawful. 
Doudera said she imagined people may want to utilize an agreement like this in a variety of scenarios. For example, when selling a house and people are touring, or when grandchildren are visiting, or during tumultuous personal times such as divorce. 
However, Doudera said she actually prefers the language in a similar proposal from Rep. Steven Wood (R-Greene), LD 1174.
That bill would also give a gun shop immunity when taking possession of a firearm owned by a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces or first responders under a firearm hold agreement. The parties would need to have contact every six months and the firearm would need to be stored separately from the shop’s inventory.
Wood envisioned his bill being a tool for those populations when they are in crisis; however, Rep. Dani O’Halloran (D-Brewer) wondered if a gun shop is the appropriate entity to deal with those individuals when they are in crisis. 
Doudera said her only issue with the bill is that she would like to see it extended to the general population, not just veterans and first responders. Wood said the gun shop owners he spoke with were concerned they wouldn’t have enough capacity to offer that service so broadly. 
The committee also asked questions about how these proposals would comply with certain federal regulations on how gun shops are required to manage their inventory and when they need to conduct background checks when transferring firearms. 
Proposals about firearm storage
There were also two proposals about how and where firearms can be stored. 
Under current law, it is a Class D crime to store a loaded firearm in a way that allows children under 16 to gain access to them without permission. Rep. Dan Sayre (D-Kennebunk) wants to expand those laws so someone is liable if their negligent storage leads to a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm gains access to one.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
LD 1120 would make it a Class D crime to store a firearm in a way that a minor or a prohibited person could gain access and use it in a crime or display it in a threatening manner. It would be a more serious Class C crime if the firearm is used to kill someone or cause serious bodily harm.
Class D crimes are punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine, while for Class C crimes that increases to five years and $5,000.  
Sayre said his bill doesn’t infringe on the right to own a gun, but offers “additional incentives for all owners to do what responsible owners are doing already” in regards to storage. He said the gun owners would be held liable if they knew a minor or prohibited person was likely to gain access. 
The Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics supported the storage bills, seeing it as a way to prevent accidental injury and death, especially of children. 
Sayre’s bill includes a third component to require licensed firearm dealers to post a notice in areas where guns are sold or transferred stating that access to a firearm in the home significantly increases the risk of suicide, death during domestic violence disputes and unintentional death of children.
There was also a proposal from Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Portland) that she said is designed to address the theft of handguns from vehicles without penalizing people who have their cars broken into. LD 1299 would prohibit a person from storing a handgun in an unoccupied vehicle, unless it is out of plain view and locked specifically in a hard-sided container with the car locked. 
It includes exceptions for law enforcement, active military members and certain hunting activities. It also outlines a civil penalty for violation.
Other committee members, as well as gun rights organizations, raised questions about how effective a hard-side container is if cheap ones can be easily broken or simply taken, in comparison to a locked glove compartment that someone couldn’t remove from the car. 
While Justin Davis, state director for the National Rifle Association, said he supports safe storage and reducing gun thefts, he doesn’t believe these bills are the appropriate vehicles because he argued they are not fair to gun owners who are victims of a crime.

The bill requires local school boards to adopt a policy to store student cell phones during class hours. Some schools use Yondr Pouches to store phones, but the legislation does not specify how a phone should be stored. 
“They just have to turn the phone off, store it off your person in a locker, car, whatever your storage solution is, it’s a similar solution. Whatever they choose,” Hulsey said.
There are three exceptions for when a student can access their phones: if they study under an Individualized Education Plan that allows it; for teacher-approved instruction and for medical purposes.
The bill was approved with no discussion. It moves to the full House for consideration.

Both Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) and Rep. Tavis Hasenfus (D-Readfield) presented proposals to the Taxation Committee on Wednesday to create income tax credits for employer-supported child care, though to slightly varying degrees.  
“Lack of affordable childcare affects parents’ ability to accept a job, maintain steady employment or reduce the number of hours they can work,” Stewart said. “This all impacts our economic growth as a state. We can do better on this.”
Stewart’s legislation, LD 203, would authorize an annual credit of 50% of the amount spent on child care, or $3,000 per child, whichever is lower. 
Hasenfus amended his legislation, LD 1555, to authorize the same amounts. However, Hasenfus’ version also has a per business cap of $36,000, which he said is intended to ensure the credit isn’t used without end and to give a leg up to small businesses.
“Small businesses in Maine also often struggle to match the larger businesses and the benefits that larger businesses are able to offer,” Hasenfus said. 
The bills also differ on how long unused credits could be carried over. Stewart’s legislation permits carry over for up to 15 years, whereas Hasenfus’ version is only up to five years. Both bills stipulate that the credit would be subject to ongoing legislative review starting in 2030. 
While the bill sponsors and members of the public who testified in support of the bills said a lack of affordable and available childcare is an issue across the state, they particularly highlighted the challenges in rural areas. 
According to a study from the Bipartisan Policy Center, since 2019, 81 licensed child care providers in Aroostook County have closed, while only 38 providers have opened, resulting in a net loss of care for at least 516 children. There are only 84 licensed providers across the County.
Just in March, a large child care facility in Presque Isle that served 71 children and 20 infants closed, with zero infant care available at any center nearby, said Readfield resident Krysta West, who is the deputy director of the Maine Forest industry Council. 
West said members of the council commonly cite the lack of child care as a reason they’re unable to attract employees and some have therefore taken it upon themselves to fill that gap. For example, Maine Woods and its parent company, Seven Islands, has begun the process of setting up the “Little Saplings” child care center in Aroostook County.

“Making visions such as Little Saplings become a reality requires substantial investment,” West said. “Although they’ve stepped up to invest in child care needs, public private partnerships and new policy solutions are desperately needed to ensure that these ventures remain viable.”
States have taken varying approaches to address childcare affordability. New Mexico became the first state to offer free child care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or about $124,000 for a family of four. Nearby Massachusetts and Rhode Island use the subsidy approach, providing financial assistance to help families pay for child care programs.
Some do not think tax credits are the solution. 
Maura Pillsbury, tax policy analyst for the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy, argued the state should instead reinforce and build on what it’s already done — investments that lawmakers are also currently weighing whether to reverse at the request of the governor to help fill the budget deficit. 
In 2021, Maine started providing $200 stipends per child care worker to help alleviate worker shortages during the height of the pandemic. 
Those monthly stipends doubled as part of the $59 million allocation to overhaul child care in the last biennial budget, spearheaded by former Senate President Troy Jackson (D-Aroostook). The package also expanded eligibility for the Child Care Affordability Program, which provides child care subsidies. The Mills administration had initially opposed Jackson’s plan because of an expectation that funding for it would be inadequate.
This year, Gov. Janet Mills suggested reversing those recent investments by cutting $30 million for child care worker stipends to bring them back to 2022 levels, among other funding reductions to services such as Head Start.
Pillsbury requested lawmakers instead reject these cuts, arguing tax breaks for businesses are less efficient and equitable than providing direct subsidies.
“If we want to attract and retain more people in a career that prepares our youngest residents for success and gives workers in every corner of our state the chance to stay in their jobs, we must do better by them,” Pillsbury said.
Questions raised by Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) suggested she may be opposed to the tax credit approach but for different reasons. “Why should I and other seniors like me, who had to pay for our own childcare and didn’t get these credits, now have to pay?” Rudnicki asked.
Referring to home day care options, Rudnicki also questioned whether it would be more effective to loosen child care regulations instead.
“Is this really the best way to go about this?”
West argued it is. “It gives employers flexibility to pursue the needs of their local community,” she responded.
Rudnicki similarly suggested licensing changes during the hearing for a bill to increase the state’s child tax credit. That plan from Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) to double the state’s child tax credit for children under six years old would be paid for by phasing out the benefit for the state’s highest earners.
During that hearing, child care providers argued that loosening restrictions would damage the quality of the care and that liability insurance would likely refuse to insure providers.

The Trump administration on Wednesday sued Maine over policies that allow some trans athletes to compete in women’s sports. Bondi said Maine is violating federal law intended to prevent discrimination based on sex. 
The administration is asking the court to bar Maine trans athletes from participating in women’s sports and asking the court to “have the titles returned to the young women who rightfully won these sports,” Bondi said.
“We’re looking at Minnesota. We’re looking at California. We’re looking at many, many states but they are the top two that should be on notice because we’ve been communicating with them,” Bondi said during a news conference.
In February, Trump signed an executive order barring trans athletes from playing girls and women’s sports. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal legal opinion that states barring trans athlete participation would violate the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which supersedes Trump’s executive order.
Bondi in February warned Ellison that the Justice Department is prepared to sue the state over its trans athlete policy.
The U.S. Department of Education is investigating the Minnesota State High School League for publicly announcing it would not comply with Trump’s executive order because it’s subject to state anti-discrimination laws, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.
The Trump administration has threatened to cut off funding for Maine’s public schools and school lunch programs, and the Justice Department clawed back $1.5 million in grants from Maine’s Corrections Department for allowing a trans prisoner in a women’s prison.
Maine Gov. Janet Mills defiantly told Trump in a heated exchange back in February that she would “see you in court” after he threatened to pull funding.

Screenshot from Fort Benning livestream Fort Benning’s name has officially been restored after a two-year stint as Fort Moore that was part of a national move away from Confederate namesakes. 
But the Pentagon says the Army post near Columbus is now named for a different Benning – World War I veteran Fred Benning of Nebraska, an Army corporal who enlisted when he was 17 and served in the First Infantry Division. Originally, Confederate Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, who fought to preserve slavery, was the Benning being honored.
New signage was unveiled Wednesday during a renaming ceremony at the base, which is one of the country’s largest installations. Fred Benning’s granddaughter was there, sharing memories of her grandfather. 
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memo renaming the base last month, saying at the time in a short video statement that “now Fort Benning is back too.” The move followed the return of Fort Bragg’s name in North Carolina, in that case going with Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran, as the new namesake instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg.
The updated names had been the work of a commission on renaming bases honoring Confederates created by Congress, and that commission was part of a defense authorization bill that had enough support in 2020 to override President Donald Trump’s veto during his first term.
Georgia’s Fort Gordon near Augusta was also renamed Fort Eisenhower in 2023 after General of the Army and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower as part of that push. The original name had honored John B. Gordon, a major general in the Confederate army who went on to serve as Georgia governor and U.S. senator. 
In 2023, Fort Benning had been renamed Fort Moore in honor of Lt. Gen. Hal and Julia Moore. During the Vietnam War, while Hal Moore was deployed, Julia worked to change the way the U.S. military handled death notifications. At the time, they were delivered by cabbies carrying a telegram. The couple is buried at the post’s military cemetery.
“Both Hal and Julia Moore remarkably served our country and raised the standard of excellence in the United States Army for servicemen and civilian spouses alike. I am proud that a military base in Georgia was chosen to bear their name, even briefly,” state Sen. Ed Harbison, a Columbus Democrat and military veteran, said shortly after the renaming was announced.
Others were more critical of the change.
“The American people understand the legacy connected to the original name, and Secretary Hegseth’s disingenuous attempt to associate it to a separate soldier is transparent and distasteful,” Margaret Huang, president and CEO Southern Poverty Law Center, said in response to the news last month. 
Maj. Gen. Colin Tuley, who is the commanding general of the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, said in public remarks Wednesday that Fred Benning’s life will serve as an inspiration for the thousands of soldiers who train there every year.
Fred Benning was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for “extraordinary heroism in action” in 1918 south of Exermont, France. He took command after his platoon commander was killed and two senior non-commissioned officers were injured. When he returned home, he operated a bakery and later served as mayor of Neligh, Nebraska.
“As we rededicate this post in his honor, may we all strive to embody the very same tenets he exemplified: unwavering dedication to people, inspirational leadership, a relentless pursuit of transformation,” Tuley said. “(His) story reminds us that true heroism is not just defined by rank. It is about that unwavering courage, that selfless service and an enduring commitment to something greater than ourselves.”

SPRINGFIELD — When Elizabeth Pollock took over as the Champaign County public defender in 2022, one of her team’s attorneys was handling 500 cases by herself in a courtroom that should have been staffed by at least three public defenders.

“That is a recipe for disaster because it’s not just taxing on the attorney, but it means that the client(s) who that attorney is representing are not able to speak with her in a timely fashion; they’re not able to review their cases with her in a timely fashion,” Pollock said in an interview. “We’re talking about months of delay in terms of meeting with attorneys and getting results.”

With many county public defender offices pushed to the limits throughout Illinois, state lawmakers are moving forward on legislation to create a statewide public defender office.

Many public defender offices in Illinois, especially in rural areas, are in desperate need of resources to provide adequate defense services. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1963 on Gideon v. Wainright that anyone accused of a crime has a right to a defense attorney, setting the basis for public defenders that judges often assign to defendants to represent a person for free.

A 2021 report commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court examined nine counties of varying sizes and found each one lacked necessary resources to provide defendants proper legal representation because of high caseloads, a lack of state oversight and long wait times to obtain a lawyer. A task force created after that report recommended Illinois fully fund public defense services and establish a statewide office that provides administrative oversight and resources.

Demand for public defense attorneys has increased in the two years since the Pretrial Fairness Act took effect in 2023. That law requires more in-depth evidence and arguments during first appearance hearings than under the old bond system, where first appearance hearings often lasted just a few minutes while a judge set a bond. Now detention hearings are required to take place within 72 hours of an arrest, meaning public defender services are often needed right away to review early evidence in cases.

Legislation in front of the General Assembly would create the “Office of State Public Defender” which would primarily be responsible for providing public defender offices around the state with more resources. House Bill 3363 passed the House last week on a 72-41 vote. It now heads to the Senate where President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, has tried to pass similar legislation in recent years.

Illinois has already established similar offices to improve other aspects of criminal court processes, including the Office of State Appellate Defender and the Office of Statewide Pretrial Services.

First steps for the office

If lawmakers approve the bill, the office may provide public defense services — but not for several years. Over the first few years, the office’s primary responsibility would be to assess the needs of public defenders in Illinois and collect data about their workloads.

“We are really lacking any type of data gathering across public defender offices in the state of Illinois because we just have never had the resources to really even count the number of cases that we have,” Pollock said.

The data gathered would guide decision making about where the money should be spent and what types of resources — from more attorneys to case investigators — public defender offices should receive.

The state has appropriated $10 million for public defense services via a fund established in 2023. State funding would provide greater equity for public defenders throughout the state, which typically receive funding from their counties, Pollock said.

“County by county, the budget depends on what that county can provide, and some counties don’t have as much revenue as others and so they just simply cannot afford to provide the resources that the public defenders need to do their jobs,” she said.

Limited data shows all Illinois counties need more public defenders. According to an analysis of county public defender budgets compiled by Northwestern University, no Illinois counties have “sufficient” staffing in public defender offices.

Some positions in public defender offices aren’t filled at all, including 83% of counties that don’t have any investigators in public defender offices, according to researchers.

Most other states also have some level of state oversight and are the primary funding source for public defenders. Illinois doesn’t fall into either category.

The bill would require counties to bump up salaries for public defenders from 90% to 95% of a state’s attorney’s salary, something proponents say will help improve recruitment and retention.

Appointing public defenders

Another key provision of the bill would change how public defenders are selected. Outside of Cook County, top county judges appoint or remove public defenders. Under the bill, a local nominating committee would be tasked with appointing or removing public defenders, which is designed to give the public defenders more independence from the judiciary.

“You’re now arguing in front of a judge who hires you and a judge who fires you, potentially. Whereas a state’s attorney is an elected official and a judge has no power over him or her and no power over their budget,” bill sponsor Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, said in an interview.

Chief judges could still be part of the local committees appointing public defenders, however. But their voice would be one of between four and six members of the commission that selects a county’s public defender. Other local commission members would include attorneys, representatives of law schools or legal professional organizations and former public defender clients.

For now, that process would not be required for counties with fewer than 35,000 people as those counties typically rely on contract attorneys for public defense that split their time in multiple counties. State law currently doesn’t require those smaller counties, which account for more than half of the state’s 102 counties, to have public defender offices. Cook County already has its own appointment process different from the rest of the state.

“The problem is the appearance of impropriety,” Vella said. “We have a system right now in Illinois and in America where defendants and people who are in the system are starting to have some real questions about the fairness of the system.”

Pollock explained it makes sense that judges are part of the process because they see the attorneys perform in the courtroom and might be able to tell who would make a good public defender. But the problem is it could create an appearance for defendants that their public defender might change how they represent someone to make their “boss” — the chief judge — happy.

Former Madison County Public Defender John Rekowski disagreed.

“The judges are in the best position to know the local landscape and know the local bench, know the local climate and pick the person who should furnish those services,” Rekowski said in an interview.

Rekowski and the Illinois State Bar Association are proposing that judges continue appointing the public defender, but the commission has the power to remove the public defender or reappoint the public defender to a new term.  Rekowski said limiting the judge’s power over public defenders to just their first appointment removes “any possibility (of) some kind of retribution or intimidation.”

The bill is likely to go through more changes as it heads to the Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Quinn Hurt/Department of Defense)Jessica Henninger wants to protect her children from the political climate that briefly closed their school library at Fort Campbell and led to books being removed from the shelves. 
“There’s a very fine line between having your children be aware of what’s going on in the world around them, and not burdening them with adult things,” Henninger said. “But … when (Black History Month) projects are canceled after you’ve completed them … they notice that stuff.” 
Citing her husband’s military service and their joint devotion to the U.S. Constitution, Henninger has joined a federal lawsuit on behalf of her children, citing First Amendment concerns and asking the courts to block President Donald Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders in schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA). Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a defendant.
Book purges at Fort Campbell, other schools run by Defense Department challenged as unconstitutional

Henninger has five children: two have graduated from DODEA schools and three are still students, named in the lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed Tuesday. That suit challenges U.S. Department of Defense policies that led to schools at Fort Campbell and other military bases removing books about slavery and civil rights. 
Henninger, whose husband is in the military and is stationed at Fort Campbell, has lived in Kentucky since October. 
Before that, in all their travels, “I can’t recall a time in our years at DODEA where my children’s curriculum was affected by anything that was going on in the presidency,” Henninger told a small group of reporters over Zoom on Wednesday. 
“We owe our children to be honest,” she said. “I’m very fearful that these actions (are) trying to take away my children’s opportunities to learn about integral parts of our history, our American history … and different cultures. That’s what makes education — and life — rich. It’s all of those differences. My younger children … they deserve the right to learn about that stuff.” 
The lawsuit: ‘Books shouldn’t be banned’ 
Via executive order Trump directed schools receiving federal funding to not teach “ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals;” he also told the Armed Forces to dissolve DEI offices and directed all federal agencies to recognize only cisgender male and female identities.  
In February, Clarksville Now, a news outlet in Clarksville, Tennessee, reported Fort Campbell librarians were busy “scrubbing for books that contain references to slavery, the civil rights movement and anything else related to diversity, equity and inclusion” in compliance with Trump’s orders. 
Fort Campbell is an Army base that spans the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville and Clarksville.
Fort Campbell schools also had to remove “bulletin boards that reference Black History Month and Black leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks,” according to Clarksville Now. 
Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said Wednesday he hopes for a preliminary injunction to “get some relief sooner rather than later from the court.” 
“We’re still evaluating exactly the timing on next steps and building that out,” he said. 
He also wants to see more transparency around which books are removed from shelves, and where those books go. 
But, he asserted: “none of these books should be taken out.” 
“To some extent, it doesn’t really matter whether we have a list or sort of engage in a debate on which individual book is the appropriate thing,” Shapiro said. “The issue here is that books shouldn’t be banned from school libraries. Kids should have an opportunity to have access to all the books in the school library without fear that somebody in the Department of Defense is going to determine that it shouldn’t be there based on an executive order regarding a ban on certain types of viewpoints.” 
‘I could not abide’ 
Soon after the executive orders, Henninger “started getting emails from the kids’ teachers, basically that just made me think that there was something going on.” 
She got “notifications that assignments were being canceled, then that the library just unexpectedly closed down.” 
She immediately started investigating, contacted the ACLU to help and ultimately joined the multi-state federal lawsuit in an attempt to block the Trump administration from carrying out the anti-DEI orders. 
“I have a very strong belief that children should have access to books,” said Henninger, who is herself a “voracious reader.” 
“When I was a child, I read. That’s how I learned about the world around me. It’s how I learned about other people and life experiences outside of my own,” she said. “And I feel like that is an important part of being able to understand other people. And to have those options taken away from my children was something that I have never experienced before.” 
All her children, too, love books, she said. 
“We’ve never had an administration come in and interfere in this way with our children’s education,” she said. “My husband fights for our constitutional rights and our freedoms in this country, and to see those rights being taken away from my children was just absolutely something that I could not abide.” 
After the lawsuit was filed, Michael O’Day, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense Education Activity, said he couldn’t comment on an active lawsuit but offered praise for the agency’s “dedication to providing an exceptional educational experience for every student.” More than 67,000 students worldwide are enrolled in schools run by the DODEA.
“Our curriculum, rigorously aligned with DoDEA’s proven standards, has earned us the distinction of being the top-ranked school system in the United States for four consecutive years, based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the Nation’s Report Card,” O’Day said in a statement. “These standards promote academic excellence, critical thinking, and a learning environment that empowers all military-connected students to excel.”
Henninger attributes the success in part to the diversity of the student body.
“I think part of this strength is our diversity — the diversity of people that come together and we learn from each other, and that’s part of our strength,” she said. “And so to see that potentially being taken away from my younger children? That’s harmful.”  
She believes the executive orders are politically motivated and cited the Trump administration’s deportations of immigrants, saying his presidential campaign was “propped on” immigration issues. 
“And then when you see them coming into the libraries and removing those items … common sense would dictate that two plus two equals four. That’s definitely politically motivated,” she said. 
‘We can’t whitewash’ history 
For military families like Henninger’s, DODEA schools are often the only option, though that can vary based on where a soldier is stationed. Private education is expensive. Henninger’s best path was to fight back within the DODEA system,  she said. 
Other plaintiffs represented by the ACLU are enrolled in Defense Department schools in Virginia, Italy and Japan. 
“We don’t have a lot of the same recourses that that families have in the public education system. We can’t just go to our school board and and say, ‘This is unacceptable.’ We very much have to worry about retaliation and retribution. And so there’s a lot of stress and anxiety around that for a lot of people, which is understandable,” Henninger said.
She and her husband talked about the risks of joining such a lawsuit and ultimately decided she had to.
“Basically what it boiled down to (for my husband) was: ‘I joined the military to defend the Constitution, and if I can’t defend our children’s constitutional rights, then what am I doing as a soldier?'”
Her children “have their First Amendment rights just like everybody else. It’s not fair to them just because their father is a soldier that they shouldn’t be able to have the same rights as everybody else.” 
She wants her children to learn about the full history of their country, including the “not so pretty parts: the Trail of Tears and slavery and the fight for civil rights.” 
“It is our true history,” she said. “And we can’t whitewash that away.”

The product of a secret search, he lasted for less than one year.In the face of a threatened veto from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida House passed a bill Wednesday with widespread member support that would reopen presidential searches to public scrutiny. 
Representatives voted 104-8 on HB 1321, introduced by Rep. Michelle Salzman and decried by DeSantis, which would repeal the public records exemption on applicants for presidencies at state colleges and universities. 
“In summary, this bill is about transparency, term limiting bureaucrats, and good governance,” Salzman said on the House floor Wednesday.

The bill would prohibit the governor’s office from influencing who might lead the institutions and  remove the Board of Governors’ required approval of finalists presented by search committees. The bill would leave searches to boards of trustees of individual universities, which typically include more local stakeholders. 
“This isn’t an attack on the Board of Governors. This isn’t an attack on our great governor. This is simply bringing the second largest component of the state budget into the sunshine,” Salzman said. 
During a news conference about law enforcement in Fort Myers on Wednesday, DeSantis said the bill would “kneecap our ability to hold higher ed accountable.”
“I don’t think that’s gonna get on the desk. If it does, we’ll invite you all to the ceremony where we’ll veto. That’s fine, but I don’t even think it’s gonna get there,” DeSantis said. 
University presidential search laws are a major topic inside the Florida Capitol

SB 1726, the bill’s Senate companion with material differences including keeping searches secret, awaits its final committee stop in the Rules Committee. It received unanimous approval in its previous two committee stops. 
Bills need two-thirds support in each chamber to override a veto. 
Among the votes against the bill, seven were Republicans: Reps. Kiyan Michael, Patt Maney, Chip LaMarca, Ryan Chamberlin, Mike Caruso, and Tom Fabricio. Rep. John Temple voted late against the bill. Democrat Yvonne Hinson also voted no.
Caruso consistently has been willing to stand with the governor while the House has deviated from the executive branch’s wishes this session. 
“Public colleges and universities are funded by taxpayers from the entire state of Florida, so the state has a vested interest in overseeing leadership choices. Having the State Board of Education approve appointments ensures that presidents are held to statewide priorities, not just internal or local interest,” Caruso, the only representative to speak in opposition to the bill on the floor, said. 
Caruso made the argument that Salzman’s bill “unravels all the success we’ve made over the years in higher education,” an argument DeSantis has also made. 
DeSantis called the bill “ill-conceived” during a news conference in Pensacola on Tuesday about Hope Florida. 
Recent searches
While Florida has been ranked the best higher education system in the nation for the last eight years by U.S. News & World Report, presidential searches have faced controversy in recent years. 
Ben Sasse was the sole finalist announced for the presidency at University of Florida after a secret search. Sasse held the job for less than a year and was criticized for lavish spending while in the office. 
Florida Atlantic University restarted a secret search after the governor’s office tried and ultimately failed to position then-state Rep. Randy Fine for the job.
The governor’s office reached out to Florida International University to advocate for Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez to take their interim presidency. 
Former House Speaker Richard Corcoran was named president at New College of Florida, perhaps the first and most widely publicized instance of a DeSantis political ally being named leader of a SUS institution. 
Among the aforementioned provisions, the bill would impose term limits for the Board of Education, Board of Governors, and university and college trustees and require that members would have to be alumni of the institution or residents of Florida.

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6 in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho will try to ban a food assistance program from covering candy and soda.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which requires the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement known as “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers.
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement Tuesday. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
In Utah, lawmakers approved and Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill seeking to prohibit soda purchases under SNAP in the Beehive State. Kennedy visited Salt Lake City last week to celebrate the bill, along with other “Make America Healthy Again” legislation passed in Utah.
 How will the SNAP bill affect local retailers?

Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws.
Idaho’s new law takes effect July 1.
In a prepared statement, Washington, DC.-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center SNAP Deputy Director Gina Plata-Nino critiqued SNAP restrictions, saying they “only deepen food insecurity and strip people of their autonomy.”
“This push to restrict what Idaho households can buy is an ill-conceived, recycled attempt to shame people who need food assistance and strip them of their dignity and autonomy when data shows that their diet isn’t much different from anyone else’s,” Plata-Nino told the Idaho Capital Sun.
Little signed the bill into law on Tuesday, the governor’s office announced in a news release. The bill passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments.
In the Idaho governor’s office news release announcing Little signed the bill, Kennedy wrote in a prepared statement, “I urge all governors to follow Idaho’s lead and submit innovative SNAP waivers to the USDA to reverse the childhood chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
 Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say

Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight.
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.
Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact on the state budget.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement she was excited more states “are heeding the call to Make America Healthy Again.”
“Governor Little is a true partner to USDA, and we look forward to working together on ways to use SNAP to improve health outcomes for Americans and encourage better use of taxpayer dollars,” she added.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Ethics Commission fears changes approved by North Dakota lawmakers earlier this week could allow alleged ethical violations by public officials to go unaddressed.
“We’re going to allow ethical concerns to fester,” Executive Director Rebecca Binstock said during a special meeting on Tuesday to discuss how legislation making its way through the session could impact the commission’s work.
Members of the House on Monday voted to approve a number of amendments to the commission’s budget, Senate Bill 2004, which included a new provision requiring the commission to dismiss ethics complaints older than 180 days. If the bill is signed into law, it would take effect immediately.
The change stemmed from some lawmakers’ frustrations with the pace at which the commission processes complaints. Some filings are more than two years old.
North Dakota House removes new Ethics Commission position from budget, adds 6-month deadline

Commissioners asked Binstock how many complaints the board could be forced to dismiss if the bill is signed into law within the next few weeks
There are 28 complaints that will be more than 180 days old on May 1 — 17 of which are against state lawmakers, Binstock said. 
Rep. Mike Nathe, who brought the amendments, has said the changes would give the commission a tool to reduce its number of pending complaints, some of which are more than two years old. He called the backlog a due process concern that is unfair to those accused of violations, including some of his colleagues in the Legislature.
Commissioners took issue with the notion that the deadline would help them.
“That’s not a tool,” said Commission Chair Dave Anderson. “Giving an arbitrary restriction is not a tool.”
Anderson also said that the Legislature should give the commission more resources if it wants the board to process complaints more quickly. The commission is following the procedures prescribed by the law, he said.
“We have things that have to be accomplished according to statute the Legislature approved,” Anderson said. “So we can’t just hurry things up.”
Nathe said previously that the intent of the bill is to have the 180-day clock start ticking against complaints as soon as the law goes into effect. Under that interpretation, the Ethics Commission would still have half a year to investigate those 28 complaints.
According to Binstock, the language of the bill is not completely clear, and the deadline may work differently in practice.
Commissioners worry the deadline will prevent the commission from meaningfully investigating complaints.
“You could have people who had a complaint filed against them stall in giving you information, which would take you past the 180 days, and so then it would be dismissed,” Commissioner Ward Koeser said.
If the deadline forces the commission to dismiss a complaint before an investigation is completed, the commission’s efforts would go to waste, Binstock said.
“By following the arbitrarily imposed deadline, really what we could have is we could have quite a bit of work, quite a bit of resources put into something and then end up having nothing as a product because we just have to close it,” she said. “I don’t personally think this is a tool for North Dakota citizens.”
Senate narrowly approves adding position to North Dakota Ethics Commission

Commissioner Ron Goodman wondered whether the bill conflicts with the North Dakota Constitution, which states that the Legislature may not do anything that impedes the responsibilities assigned to the Ethics Commission under Article XIV.
“It seems to me that that’s going to be a question that maybe the Supreme Court has to answer,” Goodman said.
The budget also includes a policy provision that Nathe said would help the commission throw out complaints that are unlikely to go anywhere but that the board does not have the ability to dismiss under current law.
The bill will go to a conference committee of representatives and senators, who will work out final changes to the bill.
The Senate approved a budget that included funding for a new staff member dedicated to education and communications, though that position was slashed by the House.
The commission’s main priority for the conference committee will be urging lawmakers to add that funding back in. It also hopes to convince legislators to take policy provisions out of the budget, Binstock said.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Across Colorado, leaders of faith communities across the religious spectrum have signed onto a statement called “Truths About Immigration.” As a faith leader who serves at the First Baptist Church of Denver, I have signed in support of this statement not only because of what I know to be true about the message of my own Christian faith regarding immigrants — that they, we, are to be welcomed, cared for and loved — but also because of what I see from the office of that very church.
Located directly across the street from the state Capitol, our building brings in more people Monday to Saturday than it does on a Sunday. The primary clientele that enter the building are, in fact, immigrants. These immigrants are not looking for places to hide, nor are they looking for a handout, nor are they looking for even a place to necessarily say a prayer.
Rather, they’re looking for a place that can help them fulfill their dreams.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dreams, for example, of serving as an interpreter for the medical field for individuals who cannot speak a word of English yet require the same medical care that each of us does. Dreams of entering the United States legally, through the assistance of an immigration attorney. Dreams of starting a small business selling coffee on a street corner. Dreams of learning how to dance like their Colombian ancestors in order to keep their culture alive.
The First Baptist Church of Denver houses and partners with organizations that can provide these dreams. Together with Spring Institute, Elevation Law, Coffee Time LLC, and the Latino Arts and Cultural Institute, our building is more than just a church, it is a place that walks alongside each individual to help them accomplish and reach their goals and dreams.
Today, because of the seemingly indiscriminate actions of immigration enforcement, those dreams are on pause, because the people that were scheduled to receive these services are afraid to do so. Similarly, the people that were to provide those services — often immigrants themselves — are afraid to provide them. Our church doors are locked, and entering the building requires identification and a reason — the opposite of how a church should be.
In the midst of an immigration process — or lack thereof — that is limited, complex, backlogged, and expensive, immigrants often turn to community resources such as churches to be able to accomplish their dreams. Even when those dreams are to immigrate to this country legally, immigrants are unable to achieve such a dream just because they are afraid to enter a church.
I call on our national government to treat each human being with dignity and respect, and to allow for the due process that is a right given to each human being to be carried out. These rights are universal and do not adhere to borders or geopolitical relationships. These rights are inherent and inalienable. These rights are for each of us. These rights allow for a more just world and allow for an immigration process that is fair, efficient and effective. These rights are what solidify my faith and what grant us each life.
I plead to you, our federal government: Please, let us as faith communities carry out the work we have been called to do, because it has been proven that you cannot do it with care or compassion.

(Image credit: Heirloom Carbon Technology)As projects to store carbon underground in Louisiana await permit approval to begin putting shovels in the ground, state lawmakers are mulling over whether to allow locals to have more of a say on whether such developments should be given the green light.
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a complicated issue in Louisiana when it comes to the politics and industry surrounding it. CCS has mixed support across the political spectrum. Some believe it is a worthwhile attempt to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel and industrial production. Others believe the technology is too untested and just a way for the oil and gas industry to justify high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
As of now, dozens of applications for Class VI well permits, the ones needed to inject carbon dioxide underground, are under technical review at the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources. In a hearing earlier this year, DENR Secretary Tyler Gray said the first Class VI permits should be awarded in the first half of 2025. 
Meanwhile, lawmakers have filed several bills to allow parishes to determine whether they would allow these wells to go forward.

DENR already has strict permitting processes that require research into the geology of the land where injection sites are planned. With the federal government giving Louisiana authority to issue its own Class VI permits, the state is poised to be one of the first to do work in the emerging carbon sequestration industry. 
Some legislators have expressed frustration with how long the state is taking to award these permits out of fear that the projects may get pulled and put into surrounding states that also have the federal government’s permission to regulate Class VI wells.
One of the major fights of the session is anticipated to be over local control of CCS projects. House Bill 4 by state Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, lets parishes approve ordinances to prohibit Class VI wells. Local governments can later hold elections to allow CCS projects to move forward should the majority of the parish’s voters approve the project. 
Several other bills allow parishes to carve out prohibitions to Class VI wells or give locals the ability to weigh in on their approval.
Rep. Danny McCormick, R-Oil City, has a bill that goes so far as to make CCS illegal. He did suggest he would be willing to amend the bill but is firm in protecting property owners’ rights over their land. Public meetings in Vernon Parish drew hundreds of people against the projects, he said.
“I don’t believe anybody should have carbon sequestration under their property that [sic] don’t want it,” McCormick said.
McCormick, who does not have any proposed wells in his district, said he is passionate about the issue of private landowners who may not want these wells on or near their land. 
Class VI wells are currently proposed in Allen, Ascension, Assumption, Beauregard, Caldwell, Cameron, Calcasieu, Iberville, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, Rapids, Sabine, St. Helena, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Vermillion, Vernon and West Baton Rouge parishes. 
Senate Bill36, by Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, calls for local governments to hold public meetings and accept feedback when carbon capture projects are proposed. The proposal could be amended to add buffer zones around CCS wells and other safety precautions.
Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said the Class VI permitting process already includes public comment and local officials as part of the process.
“I see these positive economic impacts that are being seen from the Meta deal, the Hyundai deal, the CF Industries deal, all of those are going to depend upon CCS in different parts of the state,” Faucheux said.
There are some concerns from legislators in support of CCS when it comes to allowing certain parishes to ban Class VI wells. Some of the projects will require pipelines to send carbon from other parishes and even other states to a storage site. 
Rep. Brett Geymann’s proposal, House Bill 601, could stymie such pipelines. He said he is in favor of the CCS industry but wants to protect private property ownership rights.
“If the landowner doesn’t want your pipeline through their property, you have to go around them,” Geymann said.
Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, said he will object to some of the local carve outs that he believes will block interstate and intrastate commerce. The state could lose out on businesses that don’t want to have to navigate complicated restrictions.
Faucheux said taking away eminent domain – the right for the government to take private property for public use or development – for CO2 pipelines is a bad idea.
“When you look at the nature of the pipeline network, Louisiana is one of the most mature pipeline networks in any state in the country,” he said. “We’ve been able to build out that network, and CO2 is a part of that, by companies interacting directly with landowners, and the use of eminent domain is more of the exception.”
There are several bills aimed at creating safety protocols and avenues for financial support for anyone potentially damaged by CO2 wells and pipelines. Consumer protection and environmental advocates believe there needs to be rules in place should the worst-case scenario occur, and to make sure the industry knows how to manage CCS projects.
The House Natural Resources Committee anticipates hearing a large number of the local CCS-related bills at the end of April.

He also justified his lawsuit against an eastern Washington county over alleged violations of that law. The letter to the House Judiciary Committee underscores Washington’s place near the center of Republicans’ crusade against so-called “sanctuary” immigration policies, like the one enshrined in the Keep Washington Working Act passed in 2019. 
First-term Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, of eastern Washington, is among those in Congress applying scrutiny to the state law. 
“Washington’s sanctuary policies are putting the safety of its residents at risk by prioritizing criminal aliens over law-abiding citizens,” Baumgartner said in a recent statement. “It’s time for Washington to rethink these dangerous policies and put its communities first.”
Brown said that instead of pressuring his office, Judiciary Committee members should turn their oversight toward the “draconian tactics and disturbing statements” of the Trump administration. 
“Our country was founded on the promise of equal justice under law,” Brown wrote. “In America, people should not be afraid of their government.”
Brown’s missive came in response to a letter from three Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee: Chairman Jim Jordan, of Ohio, Rep. Tom McClintock, of California, and Baumgartner.
“The state of Washington not only actively thwarts federal immigration enforcement, but it also targets local law enforcement officials for complying with federal law,” they wrote late last month. “Although you claim to serve the people of Washington, your office appears to prioritize the needs of criminal illegal aliens over Washingtonians.”
Brown called these claims “plainly wrong.”
The state law “reflects our Legislature’s judgment that local police should not use their time or resources to assist in immigration enforcement, unless federal law expressly requires it, or in situations where public safety is directly implicated. Contrary to the Committee’s claims, the law does not interfere with federal immigration law,” he retorted.
The law stops local police from helping federal authorities with immigration enforcement. For example, police can’t provide nonpublic personal information to federal authorities investigating civil immigration cases, and can’t interview or detain people solely based on questions about their immigration status. 
Police also aren’t allowed to ask about their immigration status except in rare cases.
“In Washington,” Brown wrote, “we know the community is not well served when people become frightened to report crime or to cooperate as witnesses because they fear that they or a family member may be deported if they contact the police.”
President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from cities and states with similar statutes that refuse to aid in his vision of a mass deportation campaign. His Department of Justice has sued Illinois and New York over their sanctuary policies.
Some local governments, including the city of Seattle, have shot back with litigation of their own over the funding threats.
Last month, the attorney general’s office accused the Adams County Sheriff’s Office of aiding federal immigration agents for years, by unlawfully jailing people based solely on immigration status, enabling federal immigration agents to question those in custody and sharing personal information on hundreds of Washingtonians with federal officials.
Baumgartner’s district includes part of Adams County, home to about 20,000 residents.
Brown appeared confused why Congress would be so interested in his lawsuit against the county, which has retained lawyers from a law firm founded by top Trump aide Stephen Miller.
“It is unclear how a single lawsuit, filed in state court, alleging a violation of state law, is of such national prominence as to fall within the Committee’s federal investigative jurisdiction,” he wrote. “But we take seriously the role of Congress to provide effective oversight on behalf of the American people.”
The trio of congressmen asked for documentation of investigations into local law enforcement in Washington for their cooperation with immigration officials, as well as the number of declined federal requests to continue to detain people beyond their release date so immigration officers can take custody.
They also requested the cost of the investigation into the Adams County Sheriff’s Office.
Brown either declined to produce the documents because they were privileged or his office didn’t have them. He also said the cost of the Adams County investigation “is not readily available,” adding that the litigation is paid for via settlements and penalties the attorney general’s office won in court cases last year.
Adams County Sheriff Dale Wagner testified before Congress last week, with an introduction from Baumgartner. 
“This lawsuit is not about justice or protecting communities,” Wagner said. “It’s about enforcing a political agenda that restricts law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal authorities.”
And in an interview with The New York Times, the sheriff said he was within his authority to provide information about inmates to federal authorities.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Steve Sinisi of Old Crow Ranch in Durham was among dozens of farmers who paraded through the streets of Augusta on Wednesday on tractors bearing signs like “Support Farmers, Not Billionaires” and “Compost Trump.”
The more than 100 farmers and supporters were there to protest the millions of dollars in federal cuts to agricultural grants and programs and raise awareness about the impacts they would have on their farms and livelihoods.
On a sunny spring day, Sinisi said he should instead have been working on the farm, which raises pasture-grazed beef, pork and chicken.
“It’s a great time to get to work but the fact that we left our farms and came here today says something,” he said. “Unpredictability in agriculture: it does not work that way.”
Sinisi said he invested about $35,000 into a solar project to make his farm more sustainable after signing contracts with the U.S. Department of Agriculture last year. Now, the future of that contract and his reimbursement are in doubt.  
Farmers across the state and country are living with the same uncertainty after the USDA cut several programs that have provided millions of dollars and critical support to Maine farms.

Among the sources of funding under threat is the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program, a cost-share program that helps integrate conservation practices into working lands. It is funded through two sources, the Farm Bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, the latter of which the Trump administration has tried to freeze.
“Our farms here in Maine who produce the actual food we eat are going to be left high and dry if we don’t get these USDA programs reinstated,” said Sarah Alexander, executive director of the Maine Organic Farmers and Growers Association. 
This week, USDA also ended the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which has provided over $477 million to help Maine farms subsidize projects focused on integrating climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices. 
In the announcement, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the program “was largely built to advance the green new scam at the benefit of NGOs, not American farmers,” and said “select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.”
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who owns an organic farm on North Haven, marched alongside the protesters to the State House, holding a sign that read, “Support Maine farms.” 
Addressing the crowd after, she thanked those who showed up and assured them she was advocating for farmers whose contracts had been abruptly terminated. Pingree said she routinely submits a list of all federal cuts to the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, on which she serves, and said she will continue to do so until the money returns to Maine.
She criticized recent USDA staff reductions, noting that many of the laid-off workers had provided crucial technical support to Maine farmers.
“Really, what is wrong with the USDA?” she asked. “What is wrong with this administration to say they believe in farmers — yet they are breaking these contracts?”
 “People need to understand exactly what’s going on. Being here, talking to your friends and neighbors, is making a difference.”
Small farms are the target of these cuts, said Michael Levine who owns Avalon Acres in Hollis. He was expecting to receive $2,500 through the Climate-Smart program before it got cut, which would have been used for compost and organic supplements.
Last August, he got certified through USDA as an organic producer. However, he said that had he known a USDA cost share program that helps farmers obtain supplies would also be at risk, he would never have paid the fees to get certified. 
Avalon Acres had been expecting $750 through the cost share program, which he said “would not have been a small amount for us.”
Levine said he was also exploring partnerships with his local school district to provide local produce for school meals. However, earlier this year, USDA canceled the Local Food Purchasing Assistance program that would have provided $1.25 million to Maine over the next three years for food banks to source fresh food from local producers.
“The uncertainty rippling through our food system is real,” said Maine Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), who owns Broadturn Farm in Scarborough and serves as president of Maine Farmland Trust.
“Programs that farmers and communities count on are at risk, and we know the burden lands on those who are already doing the hardest work.”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) gives top marks to the expert staff of Rhode Island’s coastal regulatory agency in a new evaluation. But federal regulators remain concerned over three open seats on the politically appointed Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), calling on Gov. Dan McKee and the legislature to fill the vacancies “as soon as possible.”
“It is essential that a quorum is maintained and the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program conducts a regular and full schedule of Council and subcommittee meetings in order to implement Rhode Island’s approved coastal management program,” NOAA’s Office of Coastal Management wrote in its April 10 report.
The 148-page document examined federal data collection, in-person meetings with staff and council members, and verbal and written public comments on the agency’s performance spanning the five-year period from September 2019 to October 2024. Federal monitoring of the state coastal program is required as part of a 1972 federal law setting up coastal regulations and funding for state-level programs. 
More than one-third of CRMC’s $6.2 million budget in fiscal 2025 came from federal funds, including roughly $1.7 million from NOAA. 
NOAA’s latest evaluation concludes that the state is “successfully implementing and enforcing” its federal coastal management program based on examination of its program administration, offshore wind projects, public access and protections against shoreline erosion.
However, NOAA highlighted several weaknesses in Rhode Island’s adherence to federal regulations, including the vacancies on the 10-member council. Seven spots are filled, with the newest gubernatorial appointee, Dr. Michael Reuter of Barrington, confirmed by the Rhode Island Senate last month. The three open seats risk canceled meetings and delayed decisions if the council can’t get at least six of its sitting members to show up — a problem that has plagued the appointed body for years.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email Wednesday that the governor was seeking qualified candidates for the open seats. She confirmed candidates are now under consideration, but did not respond to follow-up questions such as how many contenders are being vetted.

A chorus calls out for reform 
Council vacancies are one of many problems cited by critics, whose frustrations with the panel’s controversial, and at times, unlawful, decisions have reached a boiling point. Coastal advocates have teamed up with Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and state lawmakers to overhaul the agency, proposing to eliminate the council and reshape the CRMC as an administrative body akin to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. Several versions of this proposal have been introduced in the Rhode Island General Assembly this year, but not advanced beyond committee prior to the legislature’s April break.
NOAA took no position on the pending state legislation but noted states have flexibility to determine the structure of their coastal management programs. Of the 29 states with federal coastal management programs, only three — Rhode Island, California and North Carolina —  give significant decision-making power to an appointed panel, according to a February report from the Rhode Island Department of Administration. 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, saw NOAA’s indifference to how Rhode Island executes its coastal management program in a positive light. Save the Bay is a leading advocate for the proposed overhaul of the CRMC.
“Sometimes, opponents [of the reform bill] will point to NOAA as this sort of bogeyman,” Thorp said in an interview Wednesday. “NOAA is basically saying, ‘we don’t care how you set it up. You have a menu of options available to you.’”
Save the Bay ultimately wants to get rid of the council, but Thorp still wants the open seats filled in the interim.
“We need the council to be fully seated so they can function and conduct their business,” Thorp said.
The CRMC issued a statement on April 10 celebrating its “good grade” from NOAA. Jeffrey Willis, CRMC executive director, acknowledged requests for an interview but did not respond to subsequent calls and emails.
60 to 80-hour weeks
The report offered high praise for the agency’s 32-person staff who “excel at defining their role as regulator and policymaker, forging strong partnerships with others who have complementary skill sets and missions.”
However, the increasing scope of their work and responsibilities, from the slew of proposed offshore wind projects to disputes over public access to the shoreline and complex permitting applications, are more than the current employee roster can handle. Employees worked 60 to 80-hour weeks during reviews of proposed offshore wind projects, according to the report. 
“Moving forward, a continued insufficient staffing level and strain felt by staff places the state of Rhode Island at a disadvantage in being asked to manage and analyze a significant amount of information and material required to complete additional federal consistency reviews,” the report stated.
Lack of staffing has also contributed to a backlog of permitting applications, insufficient enforcement against violators such as Quidnessett Country Club, and delayed and incomplete reporting required for federal grants, the report stated. 
McKee has rejected calls to fund new hires for the strapped coastal agency. His proposed fiscal 2026 budget rejects the CRMC’s request for money for five more employees. 
In lieu of more full-time workers, NOAA suggested partnerships with university law programs and use of third-party contractors. And it reiterated a requirement first made in a 2020 report to transition to an online permitting database. The original 2024 deadline has now been extended to Sept. 30, 2026.
The CRMC did not respond to questions Wednesday regarding the delays in creating the online database.
The evaluation comes as the Trump administration has imposed major layoffs and budget cuts at NOAA. How attempts to gut the federal regulatory agency will trickle down to Rhode Island’s state coastal program remains murky, though Willis told council members during an April 8 meeting that the CRMC could lose up to 10% of its $1.7 million in NOAA funding. When incorporating additional administrative costs for the state to seek and carry out federal funding, the cuts could rise to 17%, Willis said.
“At this time of year, we usually have our federal allocation in hand,” Willis said. “Right now, we don’t know how we’re going to put it in our budget and we don’t know what kind of funding we’re going to get. We’re just in a wait-and-see period.”

American Rivers has named the Gauley River No. 10 on its list of most endangered rivers. (Getty Images)West Virginia’s Gauley River has been named to a conservation organization’s list of the most endangered rivers in the country this year. 
The river is 10th on the list of  America’s Most Endangered Rivers for 2025. The river is threatened by coal mining pollution in one of its tributaries, the Cherry River, according to the organization. 
Each year, American Rivers sets the list of rivers that face a major decision that the public can influence. The list is based on the significance of the river to people and wildlife, and the magnitude of the threat. 
The West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and Appalachian Voices is suing the South Fork Coal Company, which operates more than 3,000 acres of surface mines in Greenbrier and Pocahontas counties outside the Monongahela National Forest, over alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. 
The mines have violated water pollution standards at least 80 documented times since 2019, releasing sediment and toxic heavy metals into the river, according to a news release.
The groups have challenged the U.S. Forest Service decision to grant the company access to use a national forest road as a haul road without complying with environmental protection laws. The company was first granted access to the road in 2013 based on an application that falsely claimed it did not cross into the forest, said Olivia Miller, program director for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy. The access was renewed in 2018 and 2023. 
The company has been permitted to operate the Rocky Run Surface Mine, the mine at the center of the lawsuits over pollution, since 2021.
The road was temporarily shut down, but reopened after the company appealed to the Department of Interior, Miller said. 
The environmental groups’ lawsuits have been stayed after the coal company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in February. 
“We’re waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy proceedings. So this could be tied up in court for years, and meanwhile, they are still hauling coal,” Miller said. 
The Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and and Enforcement (OSMRE) has a public comment period underway now about the coal company’s request for a valid existing rights determination to continue using the road. Mining activity in the national forest is prohibited, exempt for a few exemptions.
“For four years, this company has illegally operated within the Monongahela National Forest,” Willie Dodson, coal impacts program manager at Appalachian Voices said in a news release. “Now, having just declared bankruptcy, South Fork Coal is asking regulators to retroactively validate this activity. It’s unacceptable. If they get away with it, I shudder to think what the next encroachment by the coal industry into our public land will be. Are they going to strip Spruce Knob? Are they going to put a sludge dam at Cranberry Glades? This is the time to draw a line in the sand.”
Miller said the river being added to the endangered list will help alert policy makers and the public of the river’s plight. 
“The Gauley’s listing specifically will hopefully draw national attention to ongoing problems that we’re seeing with this company and encourage the public and policymakers to step up before any more irreversible harm occurs in this sensitive area,” Miller said. 
“We are asking OSMRE to deny the after-the-fact request that the company can continue using this road,” Miller said. “So right now, we need as much public comment as possible to pressure the OSMRE to deny their valid existing rights request.”
A representative of South Fork Coal Company could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The Gauley River draws tens of thousands of white water rafters each year for its world class rapids. The river and its tributaries are also popular fishing destinations. Miller said pollution puts the river’s recreation opportunities at risk.
“The outcome of this valid existing rights determination will reverberate far beyond West Virginia, and I think will really set a precedent for better or for worse on mining and public lands,” Miller said. “And I really don’t believe that the people of West Virginia want to see the Monongahela National Forest impacted or mined. As somebody who grew up in the Mon in Tucker County, that would be just completely devastating and earth shattering for me to see happen in my lifetime. 
“So now is the time for people to come together and protect our outdoor recreation economy and activities like rafting, fishing and hiking, hunting that people from West Virginia love, and these are activities that thrive on clean, healthy ecosystems,” Miller said. 
The Gauley River listing comes days after President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders meant to bolster the nation’s struggling coal industry. The orders allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep operating and directs federal agencies to lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands.
“Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels,” Miller said. “Even though most of our state leaders would like to ignore climate change, we cannot ignore it any longer and this push to ‘bring back coal’ is only going to cause more pain and suffering for people in West Virginia and across the world,” she said. “And I think the recent executive orders really exemplifies the tension between efforts to bolster domestic coal production again and the need to protect public lands and water resources.”

Kevin West, R-Moore, is the House author of a bill that would limit the governor’s ability to close businesses during a pandemic. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill headed to the House floor that limits the governor’s ability to close businesses during a pandemic is “irresponsible” and puts Oklahomans’ safety at risk, one lawmaker said. 
Supporters of the bill said businesses need additional protections because closures during the COVID-19 pandemic were in violation of the Oklahoma Constitution and were “very random.”
Senate Bill 672, authored by Sen. Julie McIntosh, R-Porter, and Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, would require Oklahoma governors to have scientific evidence that the “nature of a particular business” directly contributes to spreading disease before closing businesses during a declared pandemic. The governor would also need to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to “nonessential” businesses before issuing an executive order that closes businesses. 
Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, criticized the measure Wednesday. She said at the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic no one knew how the virus spread, and without a “handle on what makes us safe, it’s irresponsible to put laws in place like this.”
While she said she has a private sector and business background and wants to see businesses survive during a pandemic, Blancett said the bill has too many “open questions” and the hearing process could be extensive. 
“It was a pandemic, not an epidemic, not a bad outbreak, a pandemic,” Blancett said. “Meaning the danger of imminent death for those that are vulnerable is clear and present, and what Rep. West’s bill unfortunately does is it puts businesses at a higher level of care than it does the health of our citizens.”
During the most recent pandemic, Oklahoma had over 1.2 million reported cases of COVID-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins, which compiled the state’s statistics. 
The number of deaths was “not insignificant,” said Blancett, who voted against advancing the bill out of committee Tuesday. 
Blancett said Tulsa should not be told what to do in a pandemic based on the experiences of Moore, West’s hometown. 
“And at the end of the day, at some point in time we have to trust the people that we’ve elected to represent us,” she said. 
West, R-Moore, said his hometown let individuals and businesses make their own decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was “not a superspreader community.”
When asked about how evidence would be gathered and hearings could reasonably be held without creating an additional burden on businesses or the governor during a pandemic, West said Wednesday that he expects that impact to be “very limited.”
“I don’t see it being something that overwhelms the Governor’s Office,” he said. “But before the governor could even do that, they would have to have the scientific evidence … (that) businesses like this are a contributing factor to the spread.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Kevin Stitt declared a state of emergency March 15, 2020 and issued an executive order nine days later requiring the closure of various businesses. Businesses in Oklahoma were quickly reopened under Stitt. Under the Open Up and Recover Safely plan, the first reopening phase began April 24, 2020 and the state was “fully reopened” by June 1, 2020. 
Stitt’s closure orders faced legal challenges to allow businesses, like bars, to remain open. West said he thinks this bill could eliminate the need for these legal challenges by prompting conversations surrounding business closures, but recourse through the court system would still be an option.
West said he has not heard from Stitt’s office on this legislation yet. 
A spokesperson for Stitt did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. 
McIntosh, the Senate author, said Wednesday that the closure of businesses during the pandemic was a violation of the Oklahoma Constitution. 
The bill language references part of the Oklahoma Constitution, specifically that “all persons have the inherent right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry.”
She introduced the bill because as a physician she saw how people were affected when businesses were declared “nonessential.” She said people ended up with mental health issues and loss of purpose. 
“During COVID, it was very random what different states closed and it made no sense,” McIntosh said. “So it was OK if you went to the liquor store or the bar, but you couldn’t get your hair cut. And there was no scientific data to show that one (business) spreads the disease worse than the other.”
The bill cleared the House Commerce and Economic Development Oversight Committee on a 14-3 vote. If the House passes the measure without any changes, it heads to the governor’s desk.

(Mark Gocke/Courtesy)A dismayed Chris Servheen is raising the alarm about what’s become of federal scientists who have kept watch over the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly bear population for the last 55 years.
The group of research biologists and technicians, known as the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, are being hamstrung at best and arguably dismantled, he told WyoFile. For decades, until his retirement in 2016, Sevheen worked closely with the study team while coordinating grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“It’s functionally destroying the organization,” Servheen said. “The study team has been in place since 1970 — over 50 years of work and experience and knowledge. It’s going to just disappear and die.”

Servheen’s perplexed about what the Trump administration has to gain.
“How could anybody be so negligent and vile that they’re trying to destroy something that has brought grizzly bears back from the edge of extinction?” he said. “Why would you do that? It’s just so destructive.”
Led by Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling started with a hiring freeze. Longtime supervisory wildlife biologist Mark Haroldson retired, and his position is not being filled, according to Servheen. Then, the team’s longtime leader, Frank van Manen, announced an earlier-than-desired retirement.
“He didn’t want to leave,” Servheen said of van Manen, who declined to comment.
According to Servheen, van Manen’s departure was related to the federal government’s ongoing upheaval.
“They’re putting fear into people,” Servheen said. “That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”
The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, and its website lists four other employees. Three are technicians, which are often seasonal, entry-level employees. The remaining staff biologist has been in the job about three years.






If any of the study team’s employees opt to stick it out amid a second wave of buyouts, they’re likely to be out of an office space come fall. The Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, described by its director as “one of the nation’s key laboratories to study the ecosystems and species of the Northern Rockies,” is one of hundreds of federal facilities being shuttered by DOGE.






Although located in Bozeman, many of the federal facility’s researchers do work in Wyoming.
“They do all kinds of other stuff: brucellosis and chronic wasting disease and aquatic species,” Servheen said. “It’s a huge science center.”
The planned closure has elicited protests. According to Yellowstonian.org, 42 retired or active biologists petitioned Montana’s congressional delegation to use their influence to “protect (the science center) and its employees from these unwarranted attacks by DOGE.”
Federal offices located in Wyoming have not escaped the closures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s tribal-focused Lander conservation office and a USGS Cheyenne water science station are among those that have been marked for the chopping block.
WyoFile could not officially confirm impacts to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Federal agencies under the Trump administration have declined or not responded to WyoFile’s requests for more information on downsizing and office closures. An inquiry to a USGS public affairs officer on Thursday yielded no information about the matter.
The Center for Biological Diversity has been pressing the federal agency for details as well. On Thursday, the environmental advocacy organization publicized a Freedom of Information Act request to gain more insight into the future of the federal grizzly team.
Both recently departed veteran study team members — van Manen and Haroldson — are staying engaged in grizzly science in pro-bono emeritus roles, according to a source familiar with the situation.
Nevertheless, Servheen worries that the hit to the science team could trickle down to the grizzly population — estimated at 1,000 or so bears in the Greater Yellowstone — that it’s charged with studying.
During the decades, federal researchers have played a pivotal role in improving understanding of the region’s bruins, including completing studies that have helped make the case that grizzly bears are fully recovered and no longer require Endangered Species Act protection. They’ve also amassed mortality and other demographic datasets and compiled an annual report.
“The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery has been built on science,” Servheen said. “Removing that science eliminates our ability to maintain Yellowstone grizzly bears.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Griz-shaking-Mark-Gockecourtesy-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 16:11:40.776134

(File/Getty)A report published Wednesday by the ACLU of Alabama estimated at least 277 people died in Alabama prisons last year.
That number matches the figure provided by the Alabama Department of Corrections and is lower than the 325 deaths tabulated by Alabama Appleseed in 2023, but the number of deaths has yet to meaningfully decline in the past few years despite efforts by the ADOC to secure the population and prevent corrections officers from transporting contraband into the facilities.
“It is high,” said Eddie Burkhalter, a researcher for Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal justice reform.

A message was sent to the Alabama Department of Corrections on Wednesday seeking comment.
The ACLU said in the report that the number is likely higher because the ADOC has failed to maintain accurate records.
“While the raw number was larger (325) in fiscal year 2023, we are not seeing dramatic improvements by any means in Alabama’s prisons,” said Alison Mollman in an interview Wednesday, interim legal director of the ACLU of Alabama.
The report said the largest number of deaths (46) were the result of accidental deaths or overdoses.
The report cites corrections officers as a contributing factor for the number of deaths, particularly the deaths of overdose.
“In 2019, ADOC’s own staff members reported to the DOJ that “without a doubt” the number one way contraband is getting into prisons is by staff smuggling it in,” the report states, adding that the problem remains despite “continued notice of the central role staff play in trafficking drugs into ADOC facilities.”
The overdose number will likely be revised upward because 105 people died in prison whose cause is unknown, or the cases are still under investigation.
“It is really overdoses that are driving these death numbers,” said Burkhalter, who researches prison deaths. “Drugs continue to come in the prisons, largely in part because of officers who bring them in and staff who bring them in.”
Another 77 people died because of natural causes, though the specific causes are not known.
The report estimated that there were at least 36 deaths in Kilby Correctional Facility In Montgomery; 35 deaths at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Saint Clair County; 34 deaths at Limestone Correctional Facility in Limestone County and 26 deaths at Bullock Correctional Facility in Union Springs. The four combined accounted for nearly half of all the deaths (47%) that occurred in 2024.
ACLU also cited racial disparities in the report. While 26% of the population in Alabama is Black, Black Alabamians comprise almost 60% of the state’s prison population and account for an equal number of the deaths that happened in 2024.
“Alabama’s prisons are sites of torture,” said Allison Mollman, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. “When people are convicted and sentenced to prison, their punishment is to be taken away from their families and communities. But the punishment they experience from the state of Alabama is widespread drug use, constant violence, both at the hands of other prisoners and staff, and widespread misconduct.”
People incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons continue to face deadly and dangerous conditions more than four years after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit and publicized scathing findings about the conditions in some of the facilities.
A team of researchers from both the state and national ACLU offices compiled data from publicly available sources, including news articles and obituaries, as well as state and federal court records and reports by nonprofits and academic papers.
They also obtained information by filing records requests with government agencies and taking numbers posted on the Corrections Department’s website.
The report recommends improved tracking of deaths and study of the factors leading to them.
“To understand and respond to the problem, we have to understand the breadth of the problem, so it is our position that the first step, and an easy step for DOC to take, is to increase the transparency, the frequency, at which it is giving the public information,” Mollman said.
Other recommendations include updating the categories that indicate the manner of death, require autopsies for every person who dies while in the Department’s custody and provide an annual report on the deaths that happened for the year.
Mollman also said the ADOC needs to change the culture within the department by changing the leadership at the warden level. Current practice is that wardens obtain their post by working up the ranks of the department, starting as corrections officers. Other states have hired people as wardens who come from different backgrounds, such as social workers.
“Punishment is where the Department of Corrections is focused on, keeping people in segregation, locking them down in their cells, keeping them in dorms without air conditioning and without supervision,” Mollman said. “If we can move from a system to focus on rehabilitation truly, that has the programming, has the incentives for incarcerated people to do well, if we have a parole system that responds to that by granting people parole who are doing well in prison, those are the types of things that change culture and improve conditions and reduce levels of violence.”

(Photo by Katie Akin / Iowa Capital Dispatch)A bill to waive university tuition and fees for Iowa law enforcement has moved out of a House subcommittee with support from its members and the public.
House Study Bill 329 would require Iowa community colleges and public universities to waive tuition and fees for “peace officers,” defined in Iowa code as sheriffs, deputies, police officers, certain parole and probation officers, security officers employed by a state university, conservation officers, and qualified employees of the Department of Transportation or an aviation authority. Dependents of peace officers are also eligible for waivers, with certain parameters.
The bill would create a reimbursement fund for the waivers and place it under control of the state’s College Student Aid Commission, with a proposed $10 surcharge added to automatic or remote traffic citations providing the money to fill the fund. The commission would use money allocated to the fund to pay back colleges and universities who have applied the cost of the waivers they provided to students.

To qualify for waivers, officers must be residents of Iowa, have Iowa Law Enforcement Academy certification, meet enrollment requirements for their institution and pursue a degree related to law enforcement, according to the bill. Their dependents must agree to spend at least five years in Iowa after graduation or repay the amount that was waived.
Under the legislation, the waivers would last three years at a community college and five years at a public university.
Lobbyists representing various police associations voiced their appreciation for the legislation and the work lawmakers have put in over the past few years to pass legislation aiding in the areas of “recruitment, retention and retirement,” Iowa Police Chief Association lobbyist Larry Murphy said.
“If you think about … a 30-year career and break it into three decades, that middle piece, somewhere from year seven through 20, this piece is just really critical, because this is where officers would be either tired of the stress or (looking for) other opportunities,” Murphy said. “They’ll look at that opportunity of actually getting college paid for, partially paid for, with their kids going to community colleges or regent universities, (so we’re) very supportive.”
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board is registered undecided on the bill despite supporting its end goal of helping officers further their education because of how the program would be structured. In order to not put additional burden on the student aid commission, Carlson said the board would rather see the program practice tuition reimbursement or loan repayment rather than providing waivers.
Rep. Carter Nordman, R-Adel, chaired the subcommittee. He said he and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, who was not present at the meeting, would support the legislation. Rep. Kenan Judge filled in for Rep. Eric Gjerde and said while he could not sign his approval of the legislation himself, he would support it if it makes its way to the House floor.
With the subcommittee’s approval, the bill will head to the full Ways and Means committee.
“Anything we can do to support a police officer out there doing the dangerous work they do, I think we should do it,” Judge said.

[…]","U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado speaks during an appearance in Eagle on Tuesday. (David O. Williams for Colorado Newsline)EAGLE, Colorado — U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to start holding Trump administration officials in contempt of court and “lock them up” if they refuse to comply with the court’s unanimous order to “facilitate” the return of a Maryland man wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.
“The Supreme Court’s got to step up and say, ‘All right, we’re going to start holding people in contempt of court.’ They have the ability to sanction,” Hickenlooper said in an interview with Colorado Newsline. “They can take the people, the officials who deny any culpability or any responsibility, they can bring them in and force them to testify, to come to the court. And if they don’t come, they’re in contempt, and then you lock them up.”
Following a roundtable press event with local officials worried about what massive cuts to the federal workforce will mean for mountain towns surrounded by federally owned forests, Hickenlooper took questions from local and state media.

Hickenlooper was asked about President Donald Trump’s statements on Monday in a joint White House press conference with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at which Trump urged Bukele to build more prisons and told him “homegrowns are next” — an apparent reference to U.S. citizens. Bukele reportedly replied, “all right.”
“I did not think he meant citizens. I disagree with you,” Hickenlooper said in Eagle on Tuesday, but he was told by a reporter that Trump repeated the remarks on Fox News, emphasizing he means “homegrown criminals.”
“No, he wants to send U.S. citizens down to …?” Hickenlooper said. “Well, again, if this doesn’t get the Supreme Court in action, I don’t know what will. But obviously at a certain point, and we’re close to that point, the country’s going to rise up because there are certain things …” He didn’t complete the thought.
‘You want me to get my pitch fork?’
A federal judge in Maryland on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to show evidence it has attempted to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a brutal mega-prison in El Salvador. District Judge Paula Xinis said the current record shows “nothing has been done.”
A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday launched proceedings to determine if Trump administration officials should face criminal contempt charges over the deportations case in his court, and in Colorado on Monday, a federal judge in Denver ordered the Trump administration not to deport any detainees held in Colorado under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.
Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen living in Maryland who is married to a U.S. citizen, has a valid U.S. work permit, and has children who are U.S. citizens, was deported last month with hundreds of others under the legally questionable Alien Enemies Act. Federal authorities have admitted in court that his deportation was a mistake.
“I agree that that’s the most hideous, heinous act I’ve seen, where you can take an innocent person, pick them up for the wrong reason … and they put him in one of the most dangerous, insect- and vermin-infested prisons in the Western Hemisphere,” Hickenlooper, a former Democratic Denver mayor and Colorado governor, said. “That prison in El Salvador is notorious for how dangerous it is. And now they’re saying that they can’t get him out of there. I’m fully aware, and that will not stand. I cannot believe the Supreme Court’s going to allow that to stand.”
A reporter asked Hickenlooper what the U.S. Senate can do about the case.
“You want me to get my pitch fork?” Hickenlooper said. “The Senate, we don’t have a police force. Do you think we have a police force? We already have hearings planned and laid out on this stuff. We’ll shine a bright light on it.”
Hickenlooper said he understands the growing anger in the country directed at both the Republican Party in power for its increasingly unpopular agenda and Democrats, whom some blame for not putting up enough of a fight against administration policies. He said he felt that anger personally at a town hall in Grand Junction Monday, where people were “pretty frustrated and pissed off.”
“It’s going to be a battle. It’s going to be a war,” Hickenlooper said. “And the only real leverage that we have as a Congress in a constitutional democracy is to have people rise up. What I said to the group last night is, ‘You’ve got to organize.’ I said to the group here (in Eagle), ‘You’ve got to organize. You’ve got to demonstrate, you’ve got to march, you have to rise up.’ No senator shows up and says, ‘Hey, come watch me.’ That’s not going to change anything.”
Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been drawing massive crowds around the country for his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, both last month in Denver and more recently in deep-red Idaho.
Hickenlooper is running for reelection in 2026.

(Courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says. Those five states are included in a combined BCBS plan which is owned by Health Care Service Corporation.
In a statement, the corporation said the change is “being made with the interests of our members in mind — promoting access to treatment that is convenient and effective.”
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis. That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring. But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said. Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.
This story has been updated with a statement from Health Care Service Corporation and to clarify why the change only affects patients in five states.

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislation seeks to stop South Carolina school districts from requiring teachers to give students grades they didn’t earn.
Proposals filed earlier this month stem from a freshman senator’s quarrel with the school board he sat on before his election to the Statehouse. What started out as Sen. Jeff Zell’s attempt to block Sumter County from resurrecting a practice he fought to end could undo policies that have spread statewide over the last decade.
Measures filed April 3 in the House and Senate ban policies — whether district-wide or at individual schools — that set a minimum grade for teachers to give students, regardless of what they earned. Such policies would put school districts at risk of losing 10% of their state aid.
As a school board member, Zell helped undo a directive that barred teachers from giving students a grade of less than 50 on report cards for the first three quarters. That’s 10 points below a passing grade in South Carolina, where a D starts at 60.
Even Zell’s not sure exactly how long Sumter County’s grading floor existed. It had been in the district’s grading manual for teachers for at least a decade but was not a board decision — until the vote last August to revoke it.
Zell fought it as allowing students to do little-to-no school work for the first three quarters but still get passed on to the next grade if they applied themselves and did well in the final quarter.
“It’s just fundamentally not right,” the Sumter Republican told the SC Daily Gazette, adding, “I’ve yet to hear a single shred of evidence that it’s helpful.”
When the newly elected school board, without Zell, considered bringing back the grading floor as an approved board policy, he filed the legislation. Rep. Fawn Pedalino of Turbeville, whose district includes part of Sumter County, filed a companion bill in the House.
Zell noted the legislation specifies that students can still do extra work to replace or otherwise recover from a bad grade.
“Second chances matter to me,” but they should be provided in a way that doesn’t “incentivize lackadaisical effort,” he said.
SC students skip school a lot. The problem helps explain their dismal test scores, report finds.

On April 7, four days after the bills were introduced, the Sumter County school board rejected the proposal with a 4-4 tie vote.
But Zell and Pedalino aren’t dropping the matter.
Pedalino, who lives in Clarendon County, said the idea shouldn’t be acceptable anywhere in the state.
“We need to make sure we set these kids up for success,” she said.
Republican leaders joining them as co-sponsors include House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter and Senate Education Chairman Greg Hembree of Little River, though the school district he represents, Horry County, does not have any such policy.
“Teachers can and do issue a grade lower than a 50,” Lisa Bourcier, a spokeswoman for the state’s third-largest district, told the Gazette.
Districts’ reasoning
It’s unclear how many school districts in South Carolina have similar grading floors.
That’s not something tracked by the state Department of Education. Those are local decisions, an agency spokesman said.
But the topic has been increasingly debated around the state over the last decade, said Patrick Kelly, a high school teacher who works for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
And, while teachers understand the theory behind a grading floor, the “negatives outweigh the positives,” he said.
Shawn Ragin, chairman of the Sumter County school board, countered that setting a minimum grade such as 50 is a “strategic academic intervention, not a loophole or grade inflation tactic.
“Their purpose is to ensure students are not academically doomed by a single failure, encouraging re-engagement rather than academic withdrawal,” he wrote in a statement to the Gazette explaining his opposition to the legislation.
A 50 is still a failing grade, he noted. But assigning a grade of no less than 50 — he said “it’s not about ‘giving’ points” — ensures a student can still recover. It’s mathematically impossible to pass “after one or two zeroes,” he wrote.
Ragin, who’s also headmaster of a local private preschool, pointed to five other districts in South Carolina with similar grading floors, saying they “adopted the policy after seeing that giving a zero for missing work disproportionately harmed students in poverty, with disabilities, or experiencing trauma.”
The Gazette reached out to all five districts he cited.
In Kershaw County, which adjoins Sumter, it’s not an actual policy. However, teachers don’t give a grade of less than 50 on any report card for high schoolers. Younger students can’t get less than a 50 for the first three quarters. Parents are informed by a written note that their child’s actual grade is lower, said district spokesperson Becky Bean.
She did not say how teachers know not to give a lower grade if it’s not policy.
Fewer SC graduates went to college this fall, state report card shows

In Richland One, the district for schools in the state’s capital city, students of all grade levels can’t get less than a 50 on any of their four report cards.
The goal is to ensure “temporary setbacks do not irreparably hinder a student’s academic progress,” said district spokesperson Ilyssa Weiner.
Without the policy, she said, it’s realistic that a student facing personal challenges could earn a 25 for the first quarter. But earning a 70 — a C in South Carolina — in the next three quarters would still average 59 for the year, which is just barely failing.
Greenville County, the state’s largest district, also has a different policy for middle schoolers and high schoolers.
In high school, students can’t get less than a 50 on any report card. In middle school, they can’t get less than a 50 on any assignment. That’s because it’s more difficult to keep middle schoolers engaged, said Tim Waller, the district’s longtime spokesman.
Ending that policy could result in a “decrease in student morale and a wider achievement gap between students who have support systems and those who do not,” Waller said.
The Gazette did not get a response from messages left with spokespeople in Charleston County or Richland Two in suburban Columbia, where it’s spring break.
Teachers’ opposition
Teachers in those districts oppose the policies.
They “lessen the integrity of a diploma,” said Sherry East, a teacher in Rock Hill and president of the South Carolina Education Association.
She happened to be meeting last week with a group of teachers from Sumter County when the grading floor came up in the conversation. All of them told her they’re adamantly against the policy, she said.
Teachers want to help students but don’t want to be forced to give students a grade they haven’t earned, she said.
She agreed with Zell’s second-chance argument: “Let me let the kid do some extra work or some extra credit if I think the situation merits it,” she said.
Sumter County school district’s own survey found that more than 8 of every 10 teachers opposed the 50% grading floor, The Sumter Item reported last May, before the school board voted to revoke the practice.
Teachers who opposed the set minimum said students were “gaming the system” and not being prepared for the real world, while the relatively few teachers who supported the floor said it encouraged students in dire circumstances to still apply themselves, the newspaper reported.
Even with the backing of GOP heavyweights in both chambers, the legislation is highly unlikely to pass this year. By state law, only 10 days remain in the regular session. For the House, which is on furlough this week, only nine days remain. And neither bill has gotten a hearing yet.
The only shot at the ban becoming law this year is if it gets inserted into the state budget. And floor debate on the Senate’s spending plan is next week.
Even if it doesn’t, the bill will stay alive for next year, as this is the first of a two-year session.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1381-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 16:11:40.776134

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

U.S. Department of Justice sues Maine over transgender athlete policy


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday April 16, 2025 3:00 pm












The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which the U.S. Attorney General said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a press conference, adding that it is an issue of sports as well as safety.
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
In a statement in response to the suit, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said it’s the “latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law.”
“This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states’ rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said.

USDA ordered to unfreeze federal funding to Maine


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday April 11, 2025 7:57 pm












A federal court has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to restore funding to Maine, granting the state’s request for a temporary restraining order.
The ruling marks Maine’s first legal victory against federal sanctions imposed over its policies on transgender athletes — policies the Trump administration argues violate Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education. At issue is Maine’s decision to allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, which the federal government claims is unlawful under its interpretation of Title IX.
After the USDA froze the funds earlier this month, Attorney General Aaron Frey on Monday filed a complaint in U.S. District Court seeking to reinstate access to the money this Monday. Four days later, Justicedge John Woodcock Jr.  granted the emergency request, finding that Maine had shown it would suffer “irreparable harm” and that the USDA had failed to follow legally required procedures before halting the funding.
In a statement after the ruling, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said the order “confirms the Trump Administration did not follow the rule of law when it cut program funds that go to feed school children and vulnerable adults.”
“No one in our constitutional republic is above the law and we will continue to fight to hold this administration to account,” Frey said.

Maine, Trump administration ‘at an impasse’ after state refuses to comply with trans athlete policy


By: Lauren McCauley -  4:56 pm












Maine refused to comply with the federal government’s proposed solution to the state allegedly violating Title IX by allowing transgender girls to participate in girls sports.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
On March 31, the U.S. Department of Education sent Maine officials an impasse letter, which asked the Maine Department of Education to agree to the terms of the federal government’s proposed resolution agreement, which included rescinding policies supporting trans students.
In a response on Friday, Forster said Maine did not agree to the terms of the resolution agreement and would not sign it. The Maine Principal’s Association and Greely High School, the other two entities also under investigation, have also refused to sign the agreement.
“We will not sign the Resolution Agreement, and we do not have revisions to counter propose,” Forster wrote. “We agree that we are at an impasse.”

U.S. Justice Department cuts Maine corrections grants reportedly over transgender policy


By: Lauren McCauley - Tuesday April 8, 2025 2:59 pm












The Maine Department of Corrections said Tuesday that the Department of Justice has terminated federal funding for several grant programs after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told “Fox and Friends”the cuts were because a transgender woman was incarcerated in a woman’s prison.
The DOC said that while it “is aware of related public statements” by Bondi, the department was only provided with a brief communication from the Department of Justice, which states that the awards are being terminated because they “no longer effectuate the program goals or agency priorities,” echoing the language of other notices sent by the Trump administration.
The terminated grants help pay for drug treatment for adults in reentry, programs that foster engagement between incarcerated parents and their children, and resources for corrections agencies to improve post-release supervision in order to prevent recidivism and reduce crime.

Maine AG sues Trump administration for USDA funding freeze that hit school meals


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday April 7, 2025 2:27 pm












The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated

Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine

In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 15:08:49.198794

The panel, organized by Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) and Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham), brought together residents from around the state on Tuesday who largely focused on state and federal cuts to government support as the top issues in their lives, raising fears that basic necessities would become unaffordable for families struggling to make ends meet.
The gathering came a day after state Senate Republicans unveiled a budget aimed at cutting taxes and eradicating perceived government “waste,” amid congressional and Trump administration efforts to strip federal agencies of large chunks of funding.

Debbie McMillan, a social services worker from Columbus County, said even before the ongoing cuts to government aid, her community did not receive enough support — and that as grocery prices continue to rise, families are finding it more difficult to survive.
“Most people, if they have a family, they cannot go to work and receive $7.25 an hour and sustain a family,” McMillan said. “[Lawmakers] want to cut food stamps, they want to cut Medicaid, they want to cut all these programs, but the people need these programs to live.”
Ellie O’Connor and Judy Colwell, both residents of Wilmington, said the same cost of living issues were hitting vulnerable people in their city as well. O’Connor said the influx of wealthy retirees to New Hanover County in recent years was pricing out longtime residents who can no longer afford the region’s rising housing prices.
“We’ve got a lot of people who are coming to the county with money, which kind of edges [out] the people who have lived there for a long time, but are not making a wage that can support their family,” O’Connor said. “The housing is a real issue.”
Colwell said North Carolina needs to raise the minimum wage to help families keep up with rising prices. A resident of an independent living facility, she said staff members have told her it is “impossible to raise their children” while working minimum wage jobs — an obstacle to improving the quality of life for North Carolinians and investing in communities.
“The powers that be, I think they just don’t understand. You hear the phrase all the time, investing in people,” Colwell said. “I don’t think they understand that taking care of people is to their benefit, because people have more money to buy things and a good education will make people able to supply the jobs that corporations need for their labor force.”
Other speakers raised concerns about cuts to public schools and child care, raising concerns that North Carolina is sabotaging its future by failing to properly teach and care for the next generation. Brittany Newton, a member of the Columbus County Deciders, said teachers are quitting their jobs in her community due to insufficient pay.
“So, the classroom sizes are getting bigger and they’re not actually able to do one-on-one teaching with kids,” Newton said. “Some child is being left behind, even though they have a no left behind rule that they’re supposed to be doing.”
Residents also said the state hadn’t done enough to help communities and industries recover from the major disasters of recent years. Katy Rosenbaum, a mother of a young child, said daycares in the state were now being forced to lay off employees because COVID-19 relief funds had stopped before the industry fully recovered.
  North Carolina Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) speaks during a rally opposing school voucher funding on Sept. 9, 2024 in Raleigh.
Jen Hampton, a member of Just Economics, said counties in western North Carolina were forced to cut millions of dollars from their school systems in the wake of the disaster, adding that the lack of tax revenue from the disaster would also devastate local health care facilities and other critical public services. She said rental assistance was also a critical need for the region.
“We are advocating for revenue replacement, unrestricted, so that we don’t have to cut any more public services,” Hampton said. “People have lost their jobs or are underemployed if they can find a job, so we really need a lot more help.”
After the round table concluded, Meyer thanked residents for sharing their concerns and said he and Murdock would be reviewing the issues they’d raised. He added that they planned to write up and circulate what they’d heard in hopes of helping their colleagues better understand the issues facing everyday North Carolinians.
“It shows that the budget really should reflect the people and the interests of the people — and that every piece of this budget, if you knew what was in it, you would have questions about it, you would have ideas for it,” Meyer said. “We will certainly continue to advocate as best we can for you.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230507_221450-1024x565.jpg,,,2025-04-16 15:08:49.198794

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansans can expect to see more of their tax dollars at work within local communities when new rules go into effect next year at the agency in charge of investing state funds.
It’s a version of the “Shop Local” concept in the investment world, said Alex Orel, spokesman for the Kansas Bankers Association, one of the major backers of House Bill 2152, which makes multiple changes affecting banks statewide.
“I think long-term, this is going to be a proposal that’s going to benefit the local governments, our local communities and the state,” Orel said. “Our taxes should be invested here, or as much of them as we can anyway.”
The Pooled Money Investment Board is responsible for investing state general fund dollars and other money deposited with the state treasurer’s office. Among its programs is the Kansas Bank CD Program, which offers Kansas banks the opportunity to invest in certificates of deposit. Depending on the interest rate, which is set weekly, banks can determine whether they want to buy a CD and use those dollars to make loans in their local communities, said Mark Schifferdecker, chairman, president and CEO of GNBank in Girard.
PMIB has been required to get the highest rate of return possible for its CDs, Orel said.
While that makes good investment sense for state dollars, the CD rate was typically set using high-yielding investments, which are above U.S. treasuries, he said. That left Kansas banks no incentive to participate when they could get lower rates elsewhere.
As a result, the Kansas Bank CD Program began to disappear from PMIB’s investment portfolio. As of March 31, it was only 0.48% of the $8.5 billion invested by PMIB, meaning that most of the state’s funds are being invested outside the state.
Schifferdecker said a decade ago, the CD program investment was 10 to 15% of the portfolio.
New regulations included in HB 2152, in effect Jan. 1, 2026, will allow PMIB to offer a more competitive rate, as much as 2% lower, which is expected to increase program participation and bring tax dollars to local banks, which will then distribute them through loans to their customers.
 
At the county level
Brent Shelton, Sedgwick County’s deputy chief financial officer, said HB 2152 has an impact on counties.
Portions of the bill addressed ways to make it easier for banks to hold deposits of county money, along with the increased access to capital through the CD program, he said.
“We give our local banks the first opportunity to keep that money local,” Shelton said. “It also preserves our ability to get a market rate on that money. That helps economic development efforts, makes more money available for lending to local business. All in all, (HB 2152) was a great compromise. Everybody won.”
The “compromise” Shelton referred to was disagreement between county officials and the banking industry on the first version of the bill. In fact, there were about 20 opponents when it was first presented.
Schifferdecker said the Kansas Bankers Association led the charge to draw all the parties to the table and work out the issues. The result was that opponents either switched to becoming proponents or took a neutral stance, he said.
“How often do you see that at the federal and state government anymore?” Schifferdecker said. “I think we made it better. We didn’t everything we wanted — Kansas Bankers Association and me as a banker. They didn’t get everything they wanted. We met in the middle.”
 
The challenges 
Both county officials and PMIB officials were concerned the bill could potentially decrease their investment income. The fiscal note on the bill once it was amended points to decreased revenue for the Kansas Bank CD Program, adding that increased participation in the program is expected.
State General Fund revenues are estimated to decrease by $4.5 million in FY 2026 and by $9 million in FY 2027.
“This analysis only details the impact to the PMIB and does not consider any potential benefits that may be realized from money deposited,” the supplemental note said.
Such longer-term benefits that bankers like Schifferdecker are excited about. A Fort Hays State study, funded by the Kansas Bankers Association, explained the ripple effect seen in communities when banks invest locally.
Specifically, this study considered that when dollars are deposited in a local bank, which can then loan them out repeatedly, their impact on the community will multiply by as much as seven times through increased economic activities.
The study, completed by Emily Breit, policy fellow at the Docking Institute of Public Affairs, found that with the impact of increased income, property and other taxes earned when investments are made in Kansas, out-of-state investments would need to offer rates 3.15% higher than local rates to make the state better off. For example, if a local bank is offering a rate of 5%, then the decision to invest outside the state instead would only generate more value if the outside investment was 8.15% or higher.

“As a community bank, we can loan that money back out to businesses and farmers and consumers,” Schifferdecker said. “We’re not looking at 80% of Kansas money going to be invested in CDs — just to get that back to 10% would be respectable.”
 
A ‘game-changer’ for rural banks
Additional money being invested through rural banks like Schifferbecker’s is another important factor for the state, he said.
“It’s a game changer. Our little bank, we’re in 15 rural markets across Kansas and eastern Colorado. In some of those we’re the only bank in town,” he said. “We can take that money and loan that money back out. We’ve got lots of loan demand, particularly in this ag economy right now, and it’s really critical for us in order for us to grow. There’s only a certain amount of deposits in our little communities. The counties and school districts, they keep quite a bit of money on hand, and if we can attract more of that money, 100% of that money is going to be lent back out to the community.”
Schifferbecker understands why the state invests money outside of its borders to get a higher rate of return. Still, he was glad Kansas lawmakers recognized that long-term benefits will build from what they want to accomplish with HB 2152.
“Money invested locally truly has the multiplier effect; it’s going to raise your tax revenues. Farmers, businesses can expand and grow,” he said. “You make more money and that’s going to create tax revenue.”
Orel at KBA said the banking landscape has changed. This type of support is meaningful for all banks, but especially those in more sparsely populated areas.
“Our community banks don’t have the necessary liquidity they used to have,” he said. “This bill will allow them another liquidity option.”
The banking challenges are reflected in the data from Breit’s study. In 1984, there were 690 FDIC-insured banks and thrifts in Kansas, a number that dropped to 204 by the end of 2023. Number of bank locations grew from 216 to 1,100 in that same time period. Community banks play an important role, Breit’s research said, by maintaining banking services in rural areas where larger banking businesses don’t typically locate.
“We’re so happy,” Schifferdecker said. “I was just tickled when it passed the Senate overwhelmingly and then the House.”

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” Bondi said during a press conference, adding that it is an issue of sports as well as safety.
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
In response to the suit, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said it’s the “latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law.”
“This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said.
Mills and President Donald Trump had a tense exchange at the White House on Feb. 21 after Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his recent executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women’s sports teams consistent with their gender identity.
“You better do it because you’re not going to get federal funding,” Trump told Mills during an event with the National Governors Association captured by a press pool recording.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” replied Mills, who was attending the organization’s winter summit.
“Enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be an elected official afterwards,” Trump responded. Mills’ second term ends in 2027.
Bre Kidman-Danvers, executive director of MaineTransNet, said the lawsuit is an example of executive overreach.
“What the executive branch is actually doing at this moment is trampling over” the rights of Congress to dictate federal spending and “unilaterally deciding how laws should be interpreted,” which is the job of the judiciary, she said.
In a statement Wednesday, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said he looks forward to representing the state.
Ultimately, Frey said, “this matter is about the protections afforded by Title IX and the Maine Human Rights Act,” which includes gender as a protected class.
He said he is confident the state is “acting in accordance with those laws,” a position that he said is bolstered by the “complete lack of any legal citation supporting the Administration’s position in its own complaint.”










This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law.


– Maine Gov. Janet Mills


On Friday, the Maine Attorney General’s Office sent a letter to the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights saying it would not comply with the department’s proposed resolution agreement, which would require the state to end its transgender protections. The state also doubled down on its assertion that the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX does not have legal standing.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby appeared at the Wednesday morning press conference alongside Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The Auburn Republican has been at the center of this controversy. After sharing photos and identifying information about a transgender student athlete on her legislative Facebook page, she was censured by her peers and stripped of the right to vote or speak on the Maine House floor until she apologizes.
That post went viral and prompted the Trump administration’s scrutiny of Maine’s policy.
Bondi read off two examples of trans girls placing in girls athletic competitions, skiing and track, and recounted the initial exchange between President Donald Trump and Mills during which the Democratic governor said she’d see Trump “in court.”
Bondi also noted that two federal departments, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, deemed Maine in violation of Title IX after brief investigations into the matter.
“We have exhausted every other remedy,” Bondi said of the suit. “We tried to get Maine to comply. We don’t like standing up here and filing lawsuits, we want to get states to comply with us.”
Bondi pointed to the many ways the federal government has punished Maine. “We’ve stripped grants from Maine through other departments and we are going to continue to fight for women,” she said.
Mills also spoke to what she described as the “politically motivated investigations that opened and closed without discussion” and referenced Friday’s federal court order requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to unfreeze payments related to Maine’s school meal programs, which the governor said “reinforces our position that the federal government has been acting unlawfully.”
“Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,” Mills said.
Some Republican legislators have pushed for Maine to concede to the Trump administration’s demands, with several proposing legislation that would ban trans athletes — LD 233 and LD 868 — as well as another bill that would remove gender identity from the Maine Human Rights Act. Those bills have not yet been scheduled for a public hearing.
Asked about the choice before legislators right now, Kidman-Danvers said, “Scapegoating trans people is not going to protect Maine’s federal funding.”
“If you compromise that right, it is a slippery slope,” she said. “Once you start eroding civil rights protections, they are all up for grabs.”

(Spanberger photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury, Earle-Sears photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)With three statewide offices and all 100 House of Delegates seats up for grabs, Virginia Department of Elections campaign finance reports show candidates across the commonwealth pulled in a staggering $20.4 million between Jan. 1 and March 31, underscoring the intensity and razor-sharp competition ahead.
In the marquee governor’s race, Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger has soared to an early financial lead, raising $6.7 million to Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears’ $3.1 million. Spanberger enters the heart of campaign season with $11 million cash on hand — nearly three times more than her GOP opponent. 
Earle-Sears’ total, however, comes despite a significant fundraising constraint: as a sitting legislator, she was prohibited from soliciting donations during much of the General Assembly session.
“I think it’s important to note that that funding gap will narrow now that the legislative session is over,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “Now that the lieutenant governor is a Republican nominee, I imagine some Republicans were waiting for a resolution of the nomination process before weighing in with donations.”
Fundraising is more than just a vanity metric — it’s often a key indicator of campaign strength and viability. The flow of early money offers a roadmap for where parties and donors see the biggest opportunities or threats.
DLCC pours money into Virginia races, citing ‘All eyes on 2025’

In the crowded race for lieutenant governor, 12 contenders reported a combined $2.4 million. Republican Pat Herrity leads with $540,000, followed closely by Democrat Levar Stoney, the former Richmond mayor, at $429,000. Democrats Aaron Rouse and Babur Lateef are virtually tied at just under $400,000, while Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, trails at $306,000.
Farnsworth said that Stoney’s strong showing is likely helped by a familiar fundraising machine – former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who endorsed Stoney’s bid early on. 
“McAuliffe’s greatest skill as a politician has always been fundraising. And that pipeline will be very useful to the former mayor,” he said. 
The race for attorney general has also attracted big money early. Incumbent Jason Miyares, a Republican, raised $1.5 million in the first quarter, while former Del. Jay Jones of Norfolk, aiming for a comeback after his 2021 primary loss, followed with $931,000. Democrat Shannon Taylor, the Henrico Commonwealth’s Attorney, pulled in $534,000.
Meanwhile, the 286 candidates running for the House of Delegates brought in $5.2 million altogether. Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, sits atop the pile with $813,000. But it’s a Democratic challenger from Southwest Virginia who may be drawing the most attention — and dollars.
Lily Franklin, who narrowly lost to Republican Chris Obenshain in 2023 by just 183 votes, is leading all battleground Democrats this quarter with over $190,000 raised. She has collected more than $245,000 this cycle, putting her in a strong position to flip House District 41.
“We’re seeing big investments in Southwest Virginia — and they’re coming from everyday people,” Franklin said. “With nearly 2,000 donations and a median gift of just $25, this is a community-led movement fueled by our neighbors.”
Obenshain, who reported $50,000 raised this quarter, dismissed the fundraising numbers as political theater. 
“It’s no surprise that my opponent has used her career as a political operative to raise money from left-wing special interest groups that care more about Washington, D.C. than Southwest Virginia,” he said, touting his legislative record on tax cuts, childcare, electric bills and public safety.
Farnsworth, the political scientist, noted the strategic importance of Franklin’s campaign. 
“Early political money especially is going to be targeted to the greatest opportunities for the party, and the closeness of the last election in this district and the money Democrats are raising suggest that this may be one of the top priorities for Democrats this cycle,” he said.
Republicans in swing districts unite in ‘Purple Caucus’ ahead of Va. House races

That trend is especially visible in Virginia’s so-called Purple Caucus — a group of about one dozen House Republicans in vulnerable suburban and swing districts. 
One of its leaders, Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, appears financially underwater, raising just over $15,000 in Q1. Her Democratic challenger, Jessica Anderson, brought in more than $116,000 from over 1,300 small-dollar donors.
“There’s no doubt about it,” Farnsworth said, “if you’re in the Purple Caucus, you’re potentially vulnerable, and the fundraising game may be a key part of trying to keep that seat.”
Another GOP incumbent facing pressure is Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, who is trying to fend off a three-way Democratic primary. Coyner raised $131,000 last quarter, making her the highest-earning Republican in the House. Dustin Wade leads the Democratic field with $69,000, followed by Lindsey Daugherty and Stephen Miller-Pitts.
Elsewhere, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, who is eyeing a federal appointment as U.S. Attorney, has raised $119,000. His Democratic challenger, Catherine Elizabeth Rec, has pulled in just $1,400 since launching her campaign in February.
And in the only Republican House primary so far, Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, has dramatically outraised challenger Austen Schwend with $30,000 to just under $3,000.
With more than six months until Election Day, the cash race is just getting started. But in Virginia politics, early dollars often spell early momentum — and that’s something no candidate can afford to ignore.

López Askin, is so far the only Secretary of State candidate in the 2026 election. Current Secretary of State Maggie Tolouse Oliver has served two consecutive terms, and cannot run for the seat in the upcoming election. The position is third in succession, behind the governor and lieutenant governor. The Secretary of State administers elections, enforces ethics and keeps official records for state government.
Doña Ana County commissioners appointed López Askin to the office just two months before the 2018 mid-term elections after the previous county clerk resigned; she has since won two elections to keep the seat in 2020 and 2024.
López Askin will not step down from the Doña Ana County Clerk’s office during the campaign, she told Source, saying she will work more and lean on Deputy County Clerk Caroline Zamora.
“I’ll be working double-time evenings and weekends,” she said. “But I will continue to lead the office in Doña Ana County.”
López Askin said she has the “perseverance and dedication” to fight electoral changes at the federal level, such as House Republicans voting for a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, and the Trump Administration’s recent orders to overhaul election rules,
“It’s never been more important to protect the right to vote,” she said. “I’ve been battle-tested. Since 2018, I have been challenged. I have had to deal with extremists and election deniers and litigation. And in every single instance, I defended what we do, and I defended it well.”
Those challenges included a death threat  by former Republican candidate Solomon Peña, before his arrest for organizing four shootings at the homes of four Democratic politicians after he lost an election for a New Mexico House of Representatives seat.
López Askin has a masters in marriage and family therapy, along with a PhD in educational leadership from New Mexico State University.

(Courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says. Those five states are included in a combined BCBS plan which is owned by Health Care Service Corporation.
In a statement, the corporation said the change is “being made with the interests of our members in mind — promoting access to treatment that is convenient and effective.”
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis. That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring. But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said. Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.
This story has been updated with a statement from Health Care Service Corporation and to clarify why the change only affects patients in five states.

States were issued letters earlier this month from the U.S. Department of Education, calling on officials to “certify their compliance with their anti-discrimination obligations in order to continue receiving federal financial assistance.” Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker announced Wednesday that the state responded to the request and will not sign it.
In the letter dated April 15, Russell-Tucker wrote to the federal Education Department that Connecticut and state officials are already in compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
“We will continue to build on the collective efforts of our educators, families, and school communities to create learning environments where every student is valued and supported,” Russell-Tucker said in a statement. “We remain focused on the work happening in our schools every day and are staunchly committed to ensuring that all our 508,402 students have access to a universe of opportunities.”
Lamont echoed that sentiment on Wednesday.
“In Connecticut, we’re proud to support the incredible diversity of our schools and work tirelessly to ensure that every child, regardless of background, has access to a quality education and the best opportunity at the starting line in life,” Lamont said in a statement. “From our educators, who are mentoring and inspiring the next generation of young people, to our curriculum, our commitment to education is what has made our schools nationally recognized, and we plan to continue doing what makes our students, teachers, and schools successful.”
Hundreds of millions of dollars that Connecticut receives from the federal government in K-12 education assistance could be at risk.
Specifically, the April 3 letter from the U.S. Department of Education threatened to pull back Title I, which provides funding to support school districts with high concentrations of students from low-income backgrounds. 
Connecticut received about $553 million in federal funding for education during the 2023-2024 school year, according to School and State Finance Project. About half of that funding goes toward Title I and special education through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, also known as IDEA.
While education is mostly controlled at the state and local level, certain municipalities would feel the strain of federal changes or cuts more than others. Connecticut’s biggest cities rely much more heavily on those dollars. For Waterbury, 22% of its school funding comes from the federal government, with much of it going to Title I.
Outside Betances Elementary School in Hartford on Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., challenged the federal policies, calling them “just plain dumb and cruel.”
“This so-called guidance that threatens a loss of funding saying, ‘We’re gonna eliminate all of the hundreds of millions of dollars that Connecticut received in funding if it continues social-emotional learning,’ when, in fact, these kinds of services help stop violence, promote academic success and make students feel better about going to school,” Blumenthal said.
“This kind of policy ought to be rescinded as quickly as possible so students can be taught the basic kinds of tools they need to build friendships and avoid conflict and stop violence. It’s really pretty simple, but the Trump administration seems on a DEI bender toward destroying American education, and this particular aspect of it is so important, not just emotionally, but also academically,” Blumenthal continued.
In recent years, the Connecticut legislature has worked to diversify its teaching workforce, as several studies have shown that having educators in classrooms who look like their students can improve academic performance.
In 2023, the state legislature passed the Aspiring Educators Diversity Scholarship Program, which has begun to provide up to $10,000 annually to graduates from Alliance Districts to go into the teaching profession.
Legislation proposed this year that passed out of the state’s Education Committee would expand the scholarship beyond the state’s 33 Alliance Districts — the lowest-performing schools — to any Connecticut high school graduate, with hopes the scholarship could also diversify the workforce by bringing more men into classrooms, Committee Co-Chair Doug McCrory, D-Hartford, said at a committee meeting on March 24.
Blumenthal fears these kinds of initiatives are at risk as well.
“This policy of denigrating diversity is just plain dumb. It’s dumb and cruel because we want students to look at their teachers and see themselves,” Blumenthal said. “If they’re kids of color, if they’re kids of different religions and backgrounds, we want teachers to reflect their classrooms, and so saying, ‘Oh, we don’t want diversity in teachers’ is just really stupid. I hate to use that word. I always told my children never to call someone stupid, but this is stupid.”
Last week, Blumenthal signed a letter from a dozen lawmakers across the country that urged the federal Department of Education to “immediately rescind” correspondence sent to state education leaders in February that alleged that public education has “toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.”
In document released by the federal Department of Education titled “Frequently Asked Questions About Racial Preferences and Stereotypes Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act”, the department hinted that diversity, equity and inclusion efforts may be unlawful.
“Many schools have advanced racially discriminatory policies and practices under the banner of ‘DEI’ initiatives. Other schools have sought to veil racially discriminatory policies with terms like ‘social-emotional learning’ or ‘culturally responsive’ teaching,” the document states.
“But whether an initiative constitutes unlawful discrimination does not turn solely on whether it is labeled ‘DEI’ or uses terminology such as ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ or ‘inclusion.’ OCR’s assessment of school policies and programs depends on the facts and circumstances of each case,” the document continues. “Schools may not operate policies or programs under any name that intentionally treat students differently based on race, engage in racial stereotyping, or create hostile environments for students of particular races.”
Lawmakers across the country have opposed the Education Department’s interpretations. In an April 9 letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Craig Trainor, the acting assistant for the Civil Rights Department of Education, Blumenthal and about a dozen other lawmakers — including Cory Booker, D-N.J., Suzanne Bonamici, D-Mich., and Summer Lee, D-Pa., said the guidance from the federal government has begun to “mischaracterize federal civil rights laws, overturn state and local control laws and practices, invade local curricula decisions, and threaten the rescission of critical federal funding.”
The letter also addressed social-emotional learning.
“The FAQ document spreads misinformation by falsely suggesting, without evidence, that social and emotional learning (SEL) and culturally responsive teaching are discriminatory,” the lawmakers’ letter states. “Although SEL can take place anywhere, SEL in schools often refers to educational practices, frameworks, and programs that create supportive environments and opportunities for students to learn and practice social and emotional skills.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 15:08:49.198794

(Via Florida State Parks)Amid growing concerns over a plan to drill for oil and gas near the Apalachicola River, a proposal by two North Florida lawmakers to ban oil exploration and drilling in that region passed unanimously in the Florida House on Wednesday.
The bill (HB 1143) is sponsored by Republican Jason Shoaf and Democrat Allison Tant. It would ban the drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products within 10 miles of a national estuarine research reserve.
There are three such reserves in Florida — the Apalachicola in North Florida, the Guana Tolomato Matanzas in Ponta Verde Beach, and Rookery Bay in Naples.
The bill sponsors have said that their legislation is a response to a decision last December by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to permit an exploratory oil well near the Apalachicola River in Calhoun County.
“When this oil drilling initiative was announced in our press, my entire community, all of North Florida, went on fire,” said Tant. “It was an organic response by people here in this area who just were devastated by this possibility.”
Shoaf noted that Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an event that led to miles of oiled beaches in the Florida Panhandle.
“During the oil spill, just the threat of oil coming to our area completely crippled our economy and now we face another threat that is starting to really scare the entire community,” Shoaf said on the House floor.
Pinellas County Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross also noted the anniversary of the BP oil spill, which lasted for 87 days and was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
“In just a few days, we will remember the 11 men who were killed during that tragedy and the horrific impact to our natural areas, our wildlife, and also to our economy here in the state of Florida,” she said. “Despite being hundreds of miles away, tourism in the Tampa Bay area plummeted, and I know that in places in the Panhandle with oil washing onto the shores, this was a real threat.”
The bill calls for the DEP to conduct a “balancing test” when a permit application is submitted. The test must include the community’s conditions, hydrological connections, uniqueness, location, fish and wildlife use, time lag, and the potential cost of restoration in case of an explosion, blowout, or spill.
The bill has one significant difference with its Senate companion, sponsored by North Florida Republican Corey Simon (SB 1300). That measure does not include language about banning development within 10 miles of a reserve.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)The Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority will likely not see state funding from this session.
House Bill 848, which would have taken $2 million from the railroad car tax and directed it to the authority, failed 23-27 on second reading in the Senate. The tax brings in about $4 million annually and the money currently goes into the general fund.  
“We are not deterred easily,” Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority chairman Dave Strohmaier said Wednesday after the floor vote. “In spite of what may seem a setback, we’re full steam ahead.”
The bill was carried by Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, who pushed for months to get movement on legislation. It found broad support from legislators in the House, as well as both the Senate and House transportation committees.
However, during its Senate transportation hearing, lobbyists representing large industry interests testified against the bill. Most of their issues were based around the railroad tax being used to fund the agency.
“I don’t think any of the opponents would probably be here today if it weren’t for the funding mechanism in this bill,” BNSF lobbyist Matt Jones said on April 9.
He added that new passenger rail should not interfere with existing freight rail and, “the freight industry and freight customers should not be expected to subsidize passenger service.”
Montana Petroleum Association lobbyist Sonny Capece said it would contribute to congestion on the railway. He added it wasn’t a viable option.
“Let the private industry do it. If private industry can make this profitable, let them do it,” Capece said. “There’s plenty of private railroads nationwide that exist on a profit-making model. This one is not one of them.”
Dan Bucks, former Director of Revenue for Montana and a proponent of the bill, said the legislation wouldn’t have increased the tax. In fact, he said, he was familiar with the tax through his former position running the revenue department.
“It’s nearly impossible for the state to even contemplate increasing the rail car tax because of a federal law called the 4R Act that sets very tight standards for how the tax is levied,” Bucks said. 
Funding the authority could be a boon for everyone, he added.
“We are not focused simply on passenger rail, but also on improving the freight system for its own sake, for agricultural ship rules, mineral shippers and anybody else shipping out of Montana or using the rails for freight,” Bucks said during a hearing on April 9. “We’re interested in improving the freight service and the passenger service together so that we reduce any delay.”
Two lines in Montana have already been picked as viable routes for increased passenger rail. Both proposed passenger rail routes going through Montana would be longer than 750 miles, meaning the federal government would be primarily responsible for running the route.
It would cost billions to get passenger rail routes fully operational, but proponents of the legislation said much of the money would come from the federal government. Congress, in fact, would likely have to approve any spending on passenger rail of that magnitude.
And even then, HB 848’s funding would have gone to figuring out where the major hurdles for passenger rail would be. It would also help them match and leverage federal funding to move the project forward.
“You have to have a steady or stable funding source to be able to unlock that match,” Baum said.
On the floor, the bill saw trouble immediately as Senators received a letter on their desk signed by lobbyists from the Treasure State Resource Association, the Montana Wood Products Association, the Montana Coal Council, the Montana Grain Growers Association, the Montana Agricultural Business Association, the Montana Petroleum Association, the Montana Grain Elevator Association, the Montana Mining Association, the Montana Farm Bureau Federation and the Montana Chamber of Commerce.
“Although HB 848 redirects receipts from an existing rail tax, it creates an unacceptable precedent where freight rail customers are subsidizing passenger rail initiatives,” according to the letter, which was distributed by Sen. Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade. “Whether intentional or not, it also creates a potential expectation that freight shippers will be expected to contribute additional revenue in the future.
“Passenger rail does not benefit freight rail customers. In fact, it has the potential to interfere with the existing service we rely on.”
On the floor, the legislation saw some support, while detractors, including Majority Leader Tom McGillvary, R-Billings, essentially said passenger rail expansion was a fever dream.
“This is the most absurd bill I have seen this session,” McGillvary said. “If you vote yes on this bill you’re living in a fantasy land.”
Following the failed vote, the bill was indefinitely postponed.
There was some frustration from rail supporters about how the discussion went.
“There was a lack of understanding about what we’ve accomplished in the last four years,” Strohmaier said.

When you see fear in the eyes of a domestic violence victim, or stand with someone who has lost their sense of personal safety after a home  invasion, it changes you. 
For me, each encounter strengthened my resolve to find justice for them.  That meant two things: holding the people who hurt them accountable but also doing whatever I could to help put the victim’s life back together. 
Along with my colleagues in law enforcement, I was often the first person to speak at length with the victim of a violent crime. In addition to gathering facts that may be useful in court, I did my best  to explain the criminal justice process: what the victim should expect, what they may be asked to  do, and how long it may take to resolve their case. But supporting victims is about so much more  than that.  
Much of the real work of supporting victims happens outside the legal system — through a network of nonprofit and government agencies that quietly and steadily work with survivors to heal and move forward, here in Tennessee and across the country. Without them, resources like temporary housing for victims of domestic violence, crisis hotlines, and counseling services for victims would  simply not be available. Prosecutors are also less likely to have victims cooperate and testify if victims are overwhelmed with challenges unrelated to the legal system — whether it’s a place to  stay, coping with trauma or some other basic need.  
Tennessee victim-serving agencies warn cuts will be ‘catastrophic’ if Gov. Bill Lee fails to act

Perhaps recognizing the value of victim service providers, Gov. Bill Lee’s most recent  supplemental budget includes a one-time request for $20 million over two years for these  organizations. This is a positive step, but still far less than the $25 million in recurring annual  funding that victims’ rights agencies and their allies have identified as essential. Across the nation, federal funding for victim-serving agencies such as nonprofits and shelters is quickly dwindling.  These cuts would be particularly devastating in Tennessee, which has declined to provide consistent state-level funding for victim services in recent years.  
To be clear, these kinds of services are not luxuries for people fleeing violence. What we  sometimes blandly refer to as “victims services” include professionals who provide crucial support  to victims and their children. Further reductions to federal resources would force them to shut  down — and in some parts of Tennessee, service providers are already closing. Funding cuts could  have an exceptionally devastating impact on crime victims in rural communities who already lack  access to many kinds of support.  
To put the $25 million request from victim service providers in perspective, the Tennessee  Department of Correction spent over $900 million on incarceration in 2023. Rather than focusing  disproportionately on jailing those who commit crimes, our justice system should also invest in  serving victims and their families. And the resources are available — last year, Lee’s office claimed that the state’s “rainy day fund” of reserves had topped a record $2  billion.  
Establishing a substantial and recurring fund is absolutely vital to protect the safety, dignity, and  well-being of those who have been impacted by crime. By making a long-term investment in these community-based organizations, our criminal justice system can better serve those who are  harmed by crime and ensure that no victim suffers alone.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A proposal that would limit development in state parks and ensure maximum public scrutiny of changes to their management was approved unanimously in the Florida House of Representatives on Wednesday, 115-0.
The measure, called the State Park Preservation Act, (HB 209) follows outrage felt across the board last summer after the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) proposed to construct lodges, golf courses, pickleball courts, and disc golf courses in nine state parks.
South Florida Republican Peggy Gossett-Seidman, who co-sponsored the measure with Southeast Florida Republican John Snyder, said she received more than 1,500 emails from an angry public the week after reports about the proposal made news headlines up and down Florida last August.
The bill says that state parks must be managed to provide the greatest benefit to the state, with plans for managed areas larger than 1,000 acres required to provide an analysis.
The bill also requires the DEP to provide a report to the governor and Legislature regarding the status and operation of state parks. Additionally, the bill revises notice requirements for public meetings. It says that the Division of State Lands shall make available to the public an electronic copy of each land management plan at least 30 days before the public hearing required for parcels that exceed 160 acres in size and for parcels located within a state park.
When the development proposal was released last summer, it drew scorn from lawmakers from both political parties, including Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and former Chief Financial Officer and now U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis.
“Public lands should be enjoyed and protected,” Simpson said on X at the time. “We have to be really careful when we talk about building infrastructure in state parks.”
“I think we were all shocked what they were going to do for our precious state parks,” said Broward County Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman on Wednesday.  
“And this is in direct response to that plan and a direct response to what our constituents wanted us to do. They spoke loud and clear and told us that these are our treasures and that we’re not going to construct pickleball courts and golf courses and hotels, that we’re going to do what’s right. I feel really good today because we can turn to them and say, we’ve heard you and we acted.”
‘Treasured places’
Following passage of the bill, the Sierra Club issued a statement thanking the House.
“On behalf of Sierra Club Florida’s 38,000 members and 150,000 supporters, thank you for listening to the outcry of thousands of Floridians who rallied last summer and again in recent weeks to defend these treasured places. This is a tremendous victory for our environment, and all who call our state home,” said Susannah Randolph, of Sierra Club Florida.
The Senate version, sponsored by Southeast Florida Republican Gayle Harrell (SB 80) has passed unanimously in its two previous committees and has one more stop before the Senate Fiscal Policy Committee before reaching the floor.

Now House Bill 821 would impose a temporary moratorium on the expiration date on certain Class C drivers licenses.
Representative Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said the bill is intended to alleviate the concern that people have about getting their licenses renewed at a time that they are struggling to get an appointment at their local DMV office.

“Right now, apparently you cannot make an appointment to get your license renewal anywhere in the state,” Adams explained. “I spoke to somebody the day before yesterday who spent five hours getting his daughter’s driver’s license issued.”
Under HB 821, a Class C driver’s license would remain valid for a period of up to two years after its expiration, allowing the motorist to continue driving without the risk of penalty in the state while the backlog is cleared at the DMV. It would not apply to drivers with a canceled, revoked, or suspended license.
“Has anybody articulated from the department what these challenges are stemming from? Is it personnel? Is it funding?” asked Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover.)
Adams told the House Transportation Committee from his perspective the NCDMV has moved away from their core responsibilities, and it would take a lot of reorganization to resolve the current backlog.
“I look at it from a business standpoint, and their operations are not very well organized,” Adams replied.
Rep. Phil Shepard, the committee co-chair, agreed with the bill sponsor.
“Just this week, I’ve received a complaint from a constituent. Her license expires in a month and she called to get an appointment and the appointment is after her license expires. So she said, ‘What am I supposed to do?'”
  Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan) (Photo: NCGA Screengrab)
Shepard also agreed with Butler’s suggestion that the legislature needed to study why the DMV was continuing to have problems in serving the public and how best to resolve those pressure points.
“This bill would basically be facilitating the incompetency of the DMV by alleviating them of the responsibility of their job,” responded Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan) bluntly.
 
Warren said while the current DMV commissioner has worked to modernize the agency, the position should not be a political appointment.
“I’ve been here for three different gubernatorial administrations, and I haven’t seen any improvement in that department worth noting,” said Warren.
Rep. Donnie Loftis (R-Gaston) said many North Carolinians wait until the final weeks before their license expired to try to get an appointment. He also reminded his colleagues that it often takes more than six months to fill vacant positions at many state agencies, leaving fewer workers to serve a growing state.

Commissioner Wayne Goodwin announced in February his plans to leave the beleaguered agency as soon as a replacement could be found.
This week, the Senate included in its budget proposal a plan to establish a new nine-member Board of Motor Vehicles that would appoint the DMV commissioner, removing that appointment from the state Secretary of Transportation and the governor.
With Wednesday’s approval, House Bill 821 (Drivers License Expiration Moratorium) heads next to the House Finance Committee.
Rep. Loftis reminded his colleagues that even if the bill becomes law, North Carolina motorists would be wise to continue to seek their renewal in a timely manner.

Mike Braun is bringing 50 Indiana National Guardsmen back home to the Hoosier State and crediting President Donald Trump for their early return. 
The March deployment was set to last for 12 months and cost the state an estimated $9 million. Troops were first sent to Texas to support Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star last year under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. 
“We are proud to welcome home these brave Hoosier Guardsmen and thank them for their service during this successful mission,” said Braun in a statement. “Under the leadership of President Trump, well-managed border security is a priority and that enables these Guardsmen to return home.”

Recent data documents a 94% drop in border crossings compared to one year ago. 
During the first border rotation, Hoosiers detected 2,639 individual crossings, supported 35 surrenders and “impacted” 8,837 turn backs, according to the guard. The 50 guardsmen sent last month had 559 interactions, a news release said. 
“I commend the soldiers on this mission, and for the work they’ve done to secure our border,” said Brig. Gen. Larry Muennich, the adjutant general. “I look forward to welcoming them back home soon. This is an example of how the Indiana National Guard always stands ready to support our state and nation when called.”
The soldiers will return to the state within 60 days.

The legislation, House File 472, is known as an anti-SLAPP bill — referring to a measure intended to combat “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits. These are civil lawsuits filed by organizations or individuals against entities such as news organizations or activists not with the expectation of winning the case, but to discourage them from publishing articles or speaking publicly on an issue by engaging them in a long, expensive legal battle.
“In most cases, these actual tort claims for defamation or other related theories are weak and (lack) merit, but those purposes are tied to the speaker’s legal fees and make them back down,” Sen. Jeff Reichman, R-Montrose, the floor manager for the bill, said.
The measure would provide protections for those facing such lawsuits by allowing expedited relief in court for cases related to First Amendment rights, including freedoms of speech and press.
The House has passed anti-SLAPP bills in several previous legislative sessions with bipartisan support that have failed to advance in the Senate. During House debate on the bill, Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said he has attempted to pass anti-SLAPP measures since 2018. Those efforts were in response to a 2018 lawsuit against the Carroll Times Herald filed by a Carroll police officer who sued the newspaper after reporting that he had sexual relationships with teenagers, which the officer had admitted to. While the judge dismissed the case, the legal dispute “almost put them out of business,” Holt said.
Though no senators but Reichman spoke on the bill Wednesday, the measure was unanimously approved by the chamber.
The Senate amended the legislation to state the protections only apply to civil actions filed on or after the bill’s enactment — removing a provision in the original House bill that expedited relief could also be granted to a “cause of action asserted in a civil action.” With the bill’s passage in the Senate, it moves back to the House for approval of the amendment before it can go to Gov.

Debbie Mayfield. (Photo courtesy of the House of Representatives)With no debate, the House voted 111-1 on Wednesday to prohibit unelected state employees from conducting campaign-type activities during working hours and require agency heads to live in Tallahassee.
Similar legislation is advancing in the Senate, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has signaled that he will veto the proposal if it reaches his desk.
The governor has targeted Melbourne Republican Rep. Debbie Mayfield’s bill, HB 1445, during press conferences this week, saying it would become law “over his veto pen.”
State employees couldn’t participate in political campaigns, solicit contributions, or use their authority to influence people’s votes under the bill. Those prohibitions would apply both to candidate and issue campaigns, and employees could face first-degree misdemeanor penalties if they do so.
The sole vote against HB 1445 came from Delray Beach Republican Rep. Mike Caruso, the only House lawmaker standing with the governor this year.
Mayfield referred to her proposal on the House floor as good public policy. HB 1445 makes “several changes with the goal of ensuring that our elected officials and our appointed officials are fully committed and focused on their primary duties of serving the state of Florida,” the sponsor said.
DeSantis hasn’t publicly addressed the anti-politicking aspect of the legislation. Instead, he has focused on the requirement that his appointees live in the state capital by Oct. 1, the location of all agency headquarters.
“They’re pulling it out of their rear ends and trying to jam it through this process. Over my veto pen,” DeSantis said, likening Tallahassee to the D.C. swamp.

State employees’ involvement in politics
The involvement by state officials in DeSantis’ campaign against the ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and restore abortion access prompted legal challenges last year and has come under renewed scrutiny this legislative session.
State House deepens probe of Hope Florida Foundation’s political activity

A House panel is investigating the transfer of legal settlement money through the Hope Florida Foundation to campaign against the marijuana initiative. Then-DeSantis’ chief of staff, now state attorney general, James Uthmeier organized the money transfer to the anti-pot committee, Keep Florida Clean, which he ran, according to evidence unearthed by reporters and a House committee.
Uthmeier played down any suggestion of wrongdoing during a press conference Monday, saying there’s “not a problem.”
Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo appeared in press conferences against the marijuana constitutional amendment and got sued over the health department’s letters threatening broadcasters that aired ads on behalf of the pro-abortion-rights campaign, Amendment 4.
Additionally, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration’s creation of a webpage stating that Amendment 4 “threatens women’s safety” and its then-secretary Jason Weida’s promotion of it prompted a complaint to the Florida Supreme Court, which ultimately sided with the DeSantis administration because the plaintiff lacked standing to sue.
Aside from the DeSantis administration’s use of state resources against the ballot initiatives last year, state employees in the governor’s office called lobbyists to request donations for a political committee aligned with DeSantis as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis hinted that she was considering a run for governor, according to NBC News.
The Senate version, SB 1760, doesn’t include the provision against state employees’ involvement in campaign activities, and needs to go through one more committee before it could be eligible for a floor vote.
Both bills would require university trustees and members of the Board of Governors that oversees public universities to be U.S. citizens and live in Florida, unless they graduated from a state higher education institution.
Mayfield, sponsor of the House bill, won a suit against the Florida Department of State Secretary Cord Byrd, a DeSantis appointee, after Byrd attempted to block Mayfield from appearing on the ballot for a special election in the state Senate district seat she previously held. The Republican representative won the primary for the Brevard County district with 60.81% of the vote on April 1.
The general election is June 10 and Mayfield has resigned from the House effective June 9.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderUniversity System of Georgia Chancellor Sonny Perdue is bemoaning an increase in online classes in the state’s colleges and universities.
“It’s somewhat concerning to me as we look at this trend from post-COVID time over more and more online,” Perdue said at a Board of Regents meeting held at Georgia Southern University Tuesday. “This is really a response to our broader audience, including our presidents in the audience today, to understand if this is driven by faculty or student demand in that regard.”
“I mean, if we continue that, we can become the Western Governors University and not need all the new square footage that’s being requested every year, so that’s just a simple issue,” he added, referring to a private online university.
Perdue was reacting to a presentation on the system’s enrollment for the spring semester that showed an upward creep in online-only classes.
The portion of undergraduates studying completely online was 16% in 2022 after a spike in the aftermath of the pandemic and has since crept up to 19%. The portion of undergrads taking only face-to-face classes meanwhile shrunk from 45% in 2022 to 39% this year.
In all, 42% of undergrads take some classes online and some in person, up from 39% in 2022.
Perdue acknowledged a 2024 university system study that did not show much difference in academic outcomes between online and face-to-face classes for undergraduates, but indicated he does not like the way the trend is moving, asking staff to compile data on how Georgia compares with other states.
In remarks at the end of the public meeting, Perdue also called on university presidents to bring their workforces back onto campus.
“While we had remote work as a privilege for a while, our expectation – my expectation – is when a family, a prospective student or parents or grandparents call the campus on Friday afternoon, they get an answer,” he said.
“We’re in the customer service business,” he added. “And therefore, we are expressing our absolute expectation for our campuses to be covered five days a week – five days a week – that’s Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, all those days for our campuses, and the expectation is of our employees to come back to the campus where the energy happens in that regard, and I hope that we’re going to continue to do that. I hope that we’re going to get good cooperation from our presidents and our campuses everywhere along with that. So if that’s not what you all want, you let me know because that’s where we’re going in that regard.”
There wasn’t too much else for Perdue to bemoan in Tuesday’s enrollment report, which showed steady growth for the system.
Spring 2025 enrollment is 345,823, up 19,400 students or 6% from last spring and an all-time record for the spring semester.
Demographically, the number of white students has steadily dropped, down from 47% in 2021 to 42% today. The number of Black students has remained mostly steady in that time frame, dipping slightly from 26% to 25%.
Hispanic and Asian students have seen the most growth, with the portion of Hispanic students rising from 10% to 12% and Asian students moving from 11% to 14%.
Students in the other category, which includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students, grew 1% to make up 7% of the total population.
In-state enrollment grew by 5%, out of state enrollment by 11% and international by 6.5%.
In-state students make up about 78% of students, out-of-staters comprise just over 14% and the remaining approximately 8% are international students.

Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington, introduces his legislative assistant on the first day of the 2024 Legislative Session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A state senator is taking aim at colleges and universities in Missouri who ask prospective students or job candidates to explain how they would contribute to an institution’s diversity, equity and inclusion goals.
The legislation would prohibit schools from requiring the submission of a diversity, equity and inclusion statement for admission or employment. It would also prohibit the preferential consideration of applicants on the basis of an unsolicited submission of a DEI statement.
According to a guide from Notre Dame University, DEI statements are short essays that describe the candidate’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Bill sponsor Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington, called these statements “DEI loyalty oaths” and said they are used as a political litmus test for candidates.
“(Candidates) are expected to commit to shaping their teaching and research priorities around DEI’s radical ideology,” Brown said in a committee hearing on the bill Tuesday.
The University of Missouri does not currently require these types of statements for admission or employment. However, provisions of the bill that deal with “unsolicited statements” could have consequences for MU. The bill would bar universities from giving preferential treatment to applicants for jobs or admission who submit a DEI statement anyway.
“There would have to be proof that someone was given preferential treatment due to the statement that was submitted,” Brown said in an interview. “So absent that evidence, it wouldn’t really have any impact on current practices.”
Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, questioned whether any of these practices were currently taking place at universities in the state. Brown said he hadn’t looked since presenting the bill last year and that many universities, including Missouri State University, could have changed their policies since then. Still, Brown said the legislation is needed regardless of how many schools currently require the submission of DEI statements.
“It is something that has been required,” Brown said, “and I imagine would be in the future as well as things change and something that I feel we need to prevent now.”
Nurrenbern called the bill the “epitome of big government” before concluding her questioning.
James Harris,  testified in favor of the bill on behalf of Cicero Action and Do No Harm Action, a pair of advocacy groups who say on their websites that they oppose “destructive” and “divisive” ideologies. He said requiring DEI statements can force applicants to look for work elsewhere, ultimately harming the state’s colleges and universities.
Critics of the bill included Paul Wagner with the Council on Public Higher Education, which represents Missouri State University, Truman State University and other public colleges in the state. MU is not a member of the council. During his testimony, he called into question the bill’s vague language.
“It just opens (universities) up to so much legal liability on the basis of things that are really just vague and could just be hearsay,” Wagner said. “It puts the state and our institutions at risk.”
Brown said in an interview he was open to the input given during Tuesday’s hearing and would look into tightening the language.

The men were detained at the Salvadoran mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Despite Boasberg’s order to halt the flights, including returning two planes that were mid-air, immigration officials allowed them to land in El Salvador — and directed a third one to take off.Boasberg wrote Wednesday that the “Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt.”“The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions.

Jarrod Ousley, Rep. Nikki McDonald and Rep. Valdenia Winn appeared at an April 9, 2025, press conference slamming state and national Republican leadership for cuts to education. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A directive from the U.S. Department of Education immediately froze more than $22 million in federal funding meant to help Kansas students recover from pandemic-era learning loss.
The freeze hasn’t yet reached classrooms, but the state recognizes that could change and is asking officials to give the funds back.
U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told state education officials across the country in a March 28 letter that any states that received an extension to dole out money from the Education Stabilization Fund, which was a $276 billion federal investment into schools’ COVID-19 recovery efforts, had to stop work immediately.
McMahon said state education departments and recipients of the funds have had “ample time” to use them.
“Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon wrote.
What exactly the federal department wants has been a shifting target. But the Kansas State Department of Education administration quickly responded, detailing how every dollar of the $22.6 million is meant to be used and how the funds have benefited Kansas children.
The state had “quite a few contracts outstanding” when McMahon sent out her demands, said KSDE’s general counsel, Scott Gordon, at an April 8 Kansas State Board of Education meeting.
KSDE sent the letter to the federal government April 4 explaining the functions of the eight projects that are now on pause and urging reconsideration, which will be on a case-by-case basis.
“The U.S. Department of Education would potentially change their mind a fourth time and allow us to have that extra time that they had already previously approved,” Gordon said.
The state’s letter went through more than 15 drafts, according to Gordon.
“The funds are essential for completing projects that directly address academic development for students,” KSDE’s letter said. “These include statewide literacy and math professional development, assessment systems to students and critical investments in educator and leadership capacity.”
In the meantime, the state told every program using the funds from the extension to stop any activity that would incur further costs.
Jake Steel, the director of strategy and operational alignment in the Kansas education commissioner’s office, said Kansas classrooms haven’t yet been affected, but the longer the feds take to respond, the likelihood that classrooms feel pain increases.
“It will be a big deal if Kansas loses $22.6 million,” Steel said. “That is a huge, huge deal.”
Until that point, he said, it’s a matter of wait and see.
“We’re not trying to make enemies. We’re not trying to use kids as political pawns,” Steel said. “We’re just trying to do what is best for students, and we will respond as requested, and we will fulfill all the laws.”
Support from Kansas’ state and federal lawmakers has followed in kind.
U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, a Republican, asked the federal department to reinstate the funds in an April 5 social media post. KSDE “was successfully using COVID-19 funding to help our kids catch up from pandemic lockdowns and school closings,” unlike other states, he said in the post.
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, sent a letter to McMahon on April 9, asking the department to reinstate Kansas’ funds because of how important they have been in restoring learning loss, training educators and lowering child care start-up costs.
“This funding is critical for our schools to continue setting Kansas children up for a strong start to life,” Kelly said.
Kansas is taking a different, more moderate approach than other states in trying to reclaim the funds. Some are refusing to comply with the federal department’s demands. More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia sued the department and McMahon, calling her decision to rescind the funds “arbitrary and capricious.”
In Arizona, a Navajo Nation school district ended reading and math tutoring services and halted repairs to aging infrastructure funded through the stabilization funds, the lawsuit said. In Nevada, 14 employees were laid off. In Michigan, a school district’s HVAC project will have to be abandoned if funds aren’t released. In Maryland, Baltimore City Public Schools canceled tutoring and after-school programs.
In Kansas, almost $7.6 million of the frozen funds have been going toward statewide literacy and math training for educators. About $6.6 million was being used to help schools improve monitoring of student performance. Around $3.6 million was designated for schools to effectively use high-quality instructional materials in classrooms.
About $480,000 was being used to expose students to the full range of career and education options after high school. Spurred by a decline in measures of success after graduation, one project helps students and families explore opportunities outside of a four-year college path.
“A consequence of the learning loss created by the pandemic has been a decrease in the number of students, particularly males, pursuing postsecondary education,” KSDE’s letter said. “It is imperative to address this decline in postsecondary pursuits to ensure students have a path forward to earning a livable wage and Kansas can fulfill its workforce demand.”
The state’s letter to McMahon similarly justified each project’s funding.
Roughly $230,000 of the frozen funds were for principal and superintendent leadership development across the state. Nearly $2.3 million has been used to support child care and early childhood education. And almost $670,000 was being used for administrative and oversight costs within the state department.
KSDE secured in 2024 a late liquidation period for the education stabilization funds, which would have allowed the state’s contractors until March 28, 2026, to spend the money. Every dollar necessary to carry out the state’s plan was designated to a project or contractor before Sept. 30.
The deadline extension, which the federal department approved Sept. 10, has allowed the state to continue paying contractors to carry out the eight projects the funds have supported.
Kansas House Democrats in a Thursday press conference, slammed the Trump administration and the state’s Republican majority for shortchanging public education funding.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat, said the federal funding was a lifeline for students, helping them regain lost ground.
“Yet another promise to our children has been broken,” she said. It’s just the latest instance of dishonoring commitments made to our children.”
Expressing concern for gaps in literacy rates and dwindling workforce readiness, Rep. Valdenia Winn, a Kansas City Democrat, said investing in education is urgent, particularly to address socioeconomic disparities. The number of students reading below a basic level has steadily increased since before the pandemic and has yet to course correct.
“This issue does not discriminate,” Winn said.
The federal education funding freeze has caused uncertainty and concern for the students’ futures. State Democrats expressed particular concern toward Republican efforts to strip funding from state literacy initiatives and a push to elect state supreme court justices.

The measure is one of two regarding regulation of hemp-derived THC products sponsored by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman that were approved unanimously in the House Budget Committee. The main bill (HB 7027) is a companion to […],"Hemp being grown indoors for flower to produce CBD oil. (Florida A&M University hemp pilot project report to Florida Senate Agriculture Committee)All hemp-derived THC products would be taxed at 15% under a proposal passed in a Florida House committee on Wednesday.
The measure is one of two regarding regulation of hemp-derived THC products sponsored by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman that were approved unanimously in the House Budget Committee.
The main bill (HB 7027) is a companion to a Senate bill (SB 438) that has already passed unanimously in that chamber, although they do contain significant differences. Among them is that Salzman’s bill would not ban Delta-8, the hemp-derived THC product that has grown in popularity since hemp was legalized in the United States through the 2018 U.S. farm bill.
Like its Senate companion, the House bill limits the amount of Delta-9 hemp-derived products such as beverages and gummies. It says edibles must contain no more than 2 milligrams; be individually wrapped; and be sold in containers with no more than 20 edibles.
That raised objections from Patrick Shatzer of Sunmed/Your CBD Store, who says his company is the largest CBD brick-and-mortar business in the country with 260 locations nationwide and 42 in Florida.
“The size of the gummies — limited to 2 grams — that’s just a tiny little pinkie size wide,” he said to the committee. “That’s not the industry standard. The industry standard is anywhere from 5 to 8 grams.”
Shatzer also objected to the provision limiting 20 servings per container, saying the average dietary supplements permit 30 gummies in a container. And he raised objections to a prohibition on selling, delivering, bartering, giving, or furnishing hemp consumables that total more than 100 milligrams of THC to a person in a 24-hour period, saying it would be unenforceable.
Rep. Salzman replied that, while she is open to changing some of those limits, she is holding firm on limiting personal consumption of such products to 100 milligrams of THC a day.
“If somebody know that they can’t buy more than 100 milligrams in that day, it’s going to give them a warning subconsciously, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t have more than 100 milligrams of this stuff in a day,'” she said. “And if you want more than 100 milligrams of this stuff a day, you  probably need to get a medical cannabis card.”
Regarding the proposed 15% excise tax on hemp products, Jodi James of the Florida Cannabis Action Network said that not all hemp products are intoxicating, and that those that aren’t should not be taxed at all.
“In the state of Florida, we don’t tax vitamins, we don’t tax supplements,” she said. 
Salzman said following the meeting that she will exempt those products before the bill’s final hearing before House Commerce Committee next week. 
“That’s a no-brainer,” she said. “The purpose of this is to give it a sin-tax, and if you’re not using it for sin, then yes.”
Money for testing
The measure says that the first $6 million of revenue collected from the tax would go into a General Inspection Trust fund for enforcement and testing of hemp-derived products. The rest would go into the state’s main account, the General Revenue Fund.
Atlhough the House and Senate bills differ in some respects, one similarity that members of the committee voiced concerns about was a requirement that hemp-containing beverages be sold only through shops licensed to sell alcoholic beverages.
“I don’t think that we should be picking winners and losers here,” said Naples Republican Rep. Lauren Melo. “I, too, would like to see convenience stores added back in.”
“I, too, think it should be treated like alcohol,” added Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky. “And therefore should be available in the same way that alcohol is.”
Southeast Florida Republican Rep. Toby Overdorf said he would like to see more work regarding synthetics, which are not listed in the House measure.
Much is the same in the House and Senate bills; both would prohibit packaging that might be attractive to children and require the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs to certify any hemp-testing laboratory in Florida or any other state.
The House bill prohibits THC products from being sold, given, bartered, furnished, or delivered to consumers at festivals, fairs, trade shows, farmers’ markets, expositions, or pop-up retail establishments. And it would ban anyone from ingesting them within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school between the hours of 6 a.m. and midnight.
The bill will move to the Commerce Committee next week, its likely final stop before reaching the floor.

Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Wednesday, saying the tariffs hurt “states, consumers and businesses.”","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Wednesday, saying the tariffs hurt “states, consumers and businesses.”


With the state budget hanging precariously in the balance, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today that California will sue to block President Donald Trump’s tariff powers.
The lawsuit, which Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta plan to file in federal court this morning, argues that Trump does not have the constitutional authority to unilaterally enact tariffs. Trump cited the United States’ large trade deficit to declare a national emergency earlier this month and impose sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world.
“President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’re standing up for American families who can’t afford to let the chaos continue.”
In a matter of days in early April, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to establish a universal 10% tariff on all countries importing goods to the United States, with even higher reciprocal tariffs on some nations, then abruptly reversed course hours after they took effect, pausing most of the reciprocal tariffs while ratcheting up the import tax on China to 145%.
The chaos tanked the stock market, a huge risk for California’s forthcoming budget, which depends disproportionately on income tax revenue from capital gains earned by the wealthiest taxpayers. The state is also particularly vulnerable to other economic pain from the tariffs, because China is California’s largest trading partner, propping up manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and major ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland.
Other major potential impacts for California include driving up the cost of construction materials just as Los Angeles begins rebuilding from a series of devastating fires that flattened several neighborhoods in January.
In their lawsuit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Newsom and Bonta will ask a judge to immediately pause Trump’s tariffs.
The state contends that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act specifies many remedies a president can take in response to a foreign economic threat, but tariffs are not among them. Without this specific authorization from Congress, the lawsuit will argue, Trump’s actions are “unlawful and unprecedented.”
“The President’s chaotic and haphazard implementation of tariffs is not only deeply troubling, it’s illegal,” Bonta said in a statement. “As the fifth largest economy in the world, California understands global trade policy is not just a game.”
The lawsuit continues Newsom’s shift back toward a more aggressively confrontational stance against the Trump administration. After the Los Angeles wildfires, the governor sought to reset his relationship with Trump as he lobbied for federal disaster aid.But even though Congress has yet to approve any further assistance for Los Angeles, Newsom has begun more vocally opposing the president’s economic policies in recent weeks. In the wake of Trump’s tariffs announcement earlier this month, Newsom said California would pursue its own “strategic partnerships” on international trade.

(Photo: Lisa Sorg)The North Carolina House Agriculture and Environment Committee voted to approve a flurry of bills on Wednesday, touching on topics like wastewater and PFAS.
Rep. Mark Brody (R-Anson, Union) introduced House Bill 376, titled “Various On-Site Wastewater & Well Provisions.” The legislation would subject drinking wells and wastewater to rules and regulations determined by the state.
The bill would create the North Carolina On-Site Wastewater Contractors and Inspectors Certification Board, to consist of nine members appointed to three-year terms. This body would shoulder the responsibility to evaluate and approve on-site wastewater systems.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) asked for the reasoning behind the legislation and the push for uniform rules.
Brody explained that well drillers perform their duties in different counties across the state.
“We’re trying to get the same rules for everybody, so they don’t go to different counties with different rules,” he said.
For wastewater, under current law, if the county evaluates and makes a mistake, the state will absorb some of the costs of fines or repairs as long as the county follows state rules. If the county does not, they are on their own to finance any additional costs.
Harrison said she would vote against the bill, as she thought the jurisdiction should remain with local governments. With such varied topography across North Carolina, a one-size-fits-all model may not be the best.
“You have situations where you’ve got mountainous terrain, you’ve got coastal which is high water tables, areas prone to flooding it seems you might want to have it more narrowly tailored to local governments,” she said.
The bill moves forward to the House Rules Committee.
The panel also advanced House Bill 569, titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” a measure meant to protect North Carolinians from drinking water contaminated by PFAS — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or “forever chemicals” that are dangerous to the environment.
HB 569 outlines the permissible concentration levels of PFAS that are established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“It addresses the PFAs contamination that is put into a water source that goes into a public utility,” sponsor Rep. Ted Davis (R-New Hanover) said.
With a favorable vote, the measure heads to the House Rules Committee.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cape-fear-3-sized-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-04-16 13:15:30.549333

Maile Carter served as the director of emergency medical services in Eldridge from March 2020 through August 2023. In her recently filed lawsuit against the city, she alleges that at the beginning of her employment, City Clerk Chandra Kyte informed her she did not need to track her hours because she would be a salaried employee and exempt from overtime pay, so her timecard should always show 40 hours worked regardless of her actual hours.
Carter alleges that she was on call, responding to emergency calls, or on the work schedule, nearly all week, every week, to ensure that there was adequate coverage for emergency response teams. She alleges she was never “off the clock,” always had her pager on, and was required to restrict her movements to a limited geographic area so she could respond immediately to emergency calls.
She left her job with the city in August 2023 and alleges that in June 2024 she discovered the city had misclassified her and other city employees as salaried employees, rather than hourly employees eligible for overtime pay.
According to the lawsuit, Carter then worked with the city’s mayor pro tem and the head of the city’s finance committee, Carey Callaway Morton, to determine her actual hours worked. They allegedly determined Carter was owed, conservatively, at least $95,000 in unpaid wages.
At around that same time, the city council allegedly acknowledged it had failed to pay its current chief of police and Carter’s successor as EMS director overtime dating back to June 2022. The two were awarded lump sum payouts of $35,569 and $12,557, respectively.
Despite that, the lawsuit claims, the city has refused to approve the payment of overtime for Carter. According to the lawsuit, the city doesn’t deny it owes Carter unpaid wages but has placed the burden of proving the hours worked on Cater.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeks unspecified damages for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee Wednesday approved a bill that would require school boards to adopt policies on whether to allow students to leave school for religious study and give them academic credit for it.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, mirrors HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, which was rejected by the House Education Committee on April 2. The state already has a law that allows school boards to adopt such policies, known as Released Time Religious Instruction (RTRI). The bill would mandate the development of those policies.

The committee heard from critics and supporters of the legislation last week. 
“The bill is designed to provide local control and flexibility, ensuring a district can implement policies that best suit their needs, while respecting the constitutional rights of students and parents,” Shelnutt said Wednesday.
The senator said the policy could forbid RTRI. 
“Yes, local boards have the ability to adopt their own policies,” he said. “If the policy they implement is super narrow because this does not work in their district in any way, then so be it.”
Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, echoed a concern raised by Dale County Superintendent Ben Baker last week that there is not enough time in the school day for students to leave campus for RTRI. He said religious instruction should happen at home. 
 “This is kind of boilerplate legislation, in my view. At some point we have to give parents the responsibility we say parents should have in terms of how they go about the process of sharing moral values with their kids,” Hatcher said. “In fact, I know that it should begin at home.”
Hatcher also questioned the intent of the bill. Although the legislation says that any religious group can participate, Hatcher was concerned about what that would look like and if it would happen.
“I do know that there’s a slippery slope to this kind of legislation,” he said. “I do know that a part of the intent of legislation like this has a great deal to do with this notion of Christian nationalism.”
Sen. Roger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, raised concerns over liability. He said that students could sign up for the program, leave the school and not attend the program.
“We don’t have control over them but they’re still under us, but we don’t have control. That’s an hour that is returned outside during the hours of eight to three,” Smitherman said.
Shelnutt said the groups that host RTRI, like LifeWise Ministry, will assume all liability. According to LifeWise’s sample curriculum, it teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.”
At least 30 school board representatives from across the state attended Wednesday’s meeting. Sally Smith, executive director of the Alabama Association of School Boards, said she is disappointed the legislation passed, but would continue to have conversations with lawmakers. Smith has consistently expressed concern and opposition to the bill.
“We think that we just have to have continued conversations with our senators due to local leaders’ concerns with this bill,” Smith said in an interview. “It is in the area of making policy that presents constitutional challenges to local boards of education. So it is not as clearly clean cut as some may think.”
The bill was approved 8-1 with Hatcher as the only member that voted against the bill. Smitherman said he only voted for it to get it out of committee, but that it still needed significant work. Shelnutt said he would work with Smitherman on his concerns.
“I’m going to vote to get the bill out of committee, but I do think that before we move that bill on the floor, that these things have got to be tightened up,” Smitherman said.
The bill moves to the full Senate.

Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy offered that advice in a one-page letter he sent to state Attorney General William Tong Tuesday.
“A copy of the relevant federal contract can be obtained from the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,” Levy wrote to the state’s attorney general.
He continued: ​“Consequently, questions regarding the contract’s scope of work, including passenger ages, flight origins, DHS communications with the courts, passenger restraint protocols, and instructions provided to contractors should be directed to DHS, which oversees and enforces all relevant immigration matters.”
Levy’s letter comes a week after Tong sent Avelo a public letter of his own slamming the airline for agreeing to run deportation flights for the Trump administration out of a new base in Arizona starting this May.
Avelo’s deportation contract has sparked public condemnations from Tong, Mayor Justin Elicker, the Board of Alders, and New Haven State Sen. and President Pro Tem Martin Looney. It’s also inspired a protest at Tweed and a grassroots online boycott that has now surpassed 32,800 signatures.
[RELATED: CT lawmakers seek to restrict Avelo Airlines from contracting with ICE]
At the top of the list of questions in Tong’s April 8 letter to Levy was a request to see a copy of Avelo’s contract with DHS. He also asked the airline to confirm that it won’t operate deportation flights from any Connecticut airport and that it will never operate flights with shackled children.
Tong gave Avelo a week to respond.
Sure enough, on Tuesday, Levy sent a letter to Tong. 
In addition to stating that the DHS contract is available via a FOIA request, Levy wrote to the attorney general that ​“we do believe from the tone of your letter that there is a fundamental misunderstanding how the federal government contracts the flights that are the subject of your letter.”
Tong linked to Levy’s letter in a follow-up press release sent on Tuesday in which he made clear his dissatisfaction with Levy’s response.
“Today’s response from Avelo is totally unacceptable because it contains no response at all,” Tong is quoted as saying in Tuesday’s press release. ​“Their overly legalistic and technical letter is insulting and condescending to the people of Connecticut who have invested in and committed millions of dollars to Avelo’s success. What’s more, telling the Office of the Attorney General to pound sand and to ask the Department of Homeland Security for a copy of their contract through FOIA is a callous back-of-the-hand that shows they really don’t care what we think. It is clear all they intend to do is take state support and make money off other people’s suffering.”
Avelo flies more than two dozen direct routes out of Tweed after making New Haven its East Coast hub in November 2021. The airline is also the beneficiary of a state aviation fuel tax break.
In public statements, Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy has defended the deportation-flight contract as providing Avelo with some protection from ​“fluctuating fuel prices” and other ​“macroeconomic factors,” all in service of allowing the company to ​“grow our core business, which is scheduled passenger travel.”
An internal-company email Levy sent out on April 3 justified the deportation-flight contract as helping offset Avelo’s growing financial troubles at Tweed amid a steep increase in passenger-travel competition. 
A Tweed spokesperson has consistently dismissed this claim as ​“bizarre and untrue,” citing how Tweed’s ​“exceptional performance has helped power Avelo’s national expansion, as they have since expanded into new or slower-performing markets, all while Tweed continues to shatter previous records.”

(Getty image)Another federal judge has demanded the Trump administration release federal funds awarded to environmental nonprofits but unavailable for some or all of the last three months.
Judge Mary McElroy of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island on Tuesday ordered federal agencies to resume payments of federal grants already awarded from a pair of Biden-era Congressional spending packages. The 63-page ruling also prevents named federal agencies and cabinet members from pausing future payments based on Trump’s Jan. 20 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order or future orders with similar intent. 
“Agencies do not have unlimited authority to further a President’s agenda, nor do they have unfettered power to hamstring in perpetuity two statutes passed by Congress during the previous administration,” McElroy wrote.
The order does not end the case, but seeks to resolve short-term harms of frozen funds as the court process continues. 
Other federal judges, including in Rhode Island, have reached similar conclusions in response to the flurry of lawsuits prompted by the abrupt halt of federal grants and aid since Trump took office. 
This case pertains specifically to funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and already awarded to nonprofit recipients. Six environmental and health-related nonprofit groups, including three in Rhode Island, filed the federal complaint on March 14. The lawsuit alleges the frozen grant payments forced nonprofits to halt projects already underway, suspend hiring and contemplate layoffs, according to court documents.


Plaintiffs 
Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council
Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District
Childhood Lead Action Project, of Rhode Island
Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation, of Massachusetts
Green Infrastructure Center, of Virginia
National Council of Nonprofits, based in D.C.
Defendants 
Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins
Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright
Department of the Interior and Secretary Doug Bergum
Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin
Department of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary Scott Turner 
Office of Management and Budget and Director Russell Vought
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett 


McElroy concurred.
“The Nonprofits were left adrift as they scrambled to make sense of the Government’s actions here,” she wrote. “The pause placed critical climate, housing, and infrastructure projects in serious jeopardy, while also threatening the livelihoods of the Nonprofits’ employees as well as their fundamental missions.”
By contrast, “the Government is not harmed where an order requires them to disburse funds that Congress has appropriated and that Agencies have already awarded.”
Further damage to nonprofits’ work, including childhood lead poisoning prevention, tree planting, and local composting programs, was laid out in more detail during a three-hour hearing in McElroy’s Providence courtroom on April 3.
Attorneys representing the nonprofits, which include Rhode Island’s Childhood Lead Action Project, the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council and Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District, argued the inconsistent access to federal grants violated constitutional provisions separating powers of federal government, with devastating consequences for the nonprofits identified in the lawsuit and hundreds of others nationwide.
Computer code holds the key? 
Daniel Schwei, the U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing the Trump administration and named federal agencies, countered in written and oral arguments that there was never a sweeping freeze on federal funds, simply a selective pause and review, which was within federal agencies’ powers to initiate.
McElroy rejected the administration’s arguments.
“Record evidence makes the Government’s feigned confusion on this point particularly puzzling,” she wrote. “When one grantee logged onto the [federal] portal, for instance, the code for the pause to their funds was “IRA/BIL Hold,” abbreviations for the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or “BIL”). How difficult could it really be for the Government to figure out which actions are challenged if there is already a specific computer code for these universal pauses?”
She later invoked part of an order from Rhode Island Chief Judge John McConnell Jr. in a parallel funding freeze case filed by 23 Democratic state attorneys general.
“Rather than taking a deliberate, thoughtful approach to finding these alleged unsubstantiated ‘wasteful or fraudulent expenditures,’ the Defendants abruptly froze billions of dollars of federal funding for an indefinite period. It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision—let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences,” McConnell wrote in his March 6 order requiring federal agencies to release federal grants and aid to state governments.










The Nonprofits were left adrift as they scrambled to make sense of the Government’s actions here. The pause placed critical climate, housing, and infrastructure projects in serious jeopardy, while also threatening the livelihoods of the Nonprofits’ employees as well as their fundamental missions.


– Judge Mary McElroy of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island 


Federal judges in D.C., Massachusetts and California, among others, have come to similar conclusions in separate lawsuits challenging frozen federal funds for affected groups.
McElroy acknowledged in her order the limits of the court’s power over the executive branch.
“The Court wants to be crystal clear: elections have consequences and the President is entitled to enact his agenda,” she wrote. “The judiciary does not and cannot decide whether his policies are sound.”
She continued, “But where the federal courts are constitutionally required to weigh in—meaning we, by law, have no choice but to do so—are cases ‘about the procedure’ (or lack thereof) that the Government follows in trying to enact those policies.”

While Schwei sought to limit the scope of the proposed court order only to the nonprofits named in the case, McElroy granted the plaintiffs’ request to apply her ruling more broadly based on the likely consequences for other grant recipients not named in the case.
“It would be anathema to reasonable jurisprudence that only the named Nonprofits should be protected from the irreparable harms of the likely unlawful agency actions,” she wrote. 
Skye Perryman, CEO of D.C.-based Democracy Forward, which is representing the nonprofits in the case, called McElroy’s ruling a “crucial victory.” 
“We are pleased that a federal court has seen the Trump administration’s freeze of congressionally approved funds for what it is: another abuse of executive power that has already inflicted harm on communities nationwide,” Perryman said in a statement Tuesday. “By blocking these investments in local communities and projects, the administration is jeopardizing public health initiatives, environmental protections, and economic stability.”
Providence attorney Miriam Weizenbaum, who served as the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General’s Civil Division Chief until April 2024, is also representing the nonprofits in the case.
Matthew Nies, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment when reached by email Wednesday. 
McElroy’s order requires all federal agencies and directors named in the case to submit written updates on their compliance with her mandate no later than 5 p.m. Wednesday.

While media representation has made strides in including more women with disabilities and challenging outdated myths, there is still much progress to be made to reshape how we think about beauty and disability, particularly in academic and professional spaces. 
The Bold Beauty Project is a powerful visual arts exhibition that celebrates women with a wide range of disabilities. Through large-scale portraits paired with deeply personal narratives, the project offers an intimate, striking exploration of what it means to be a woman with a disability. The Miami based non-profit was founded by disability rights advocate Shelly Baer, LCSW and Dr. Eva Ritvo, M.D., joined as co-director  in 2015. The project’s mission for over 10 years has been to create “social change by utilizing art at the intersection of beauty and disability” and they have created shows around the US and in Panama.

In 2022, along with Karamot Adeola and Evie Strauss, I helped launch The Bold Beauty Project: University Edition—the first-ever collegiate version of the Bold Beauty Project. This student-led initiative brought together undergraduate and graduate women from both the University of Miami and Florida International University, featuring models with both visible and invisible disabilities. 
The experience of directing the Bold Beauty Project in 2022 had a profound impact on me. In 2023, I began my Masters of Public Health Degree at the Yale School of Public Health to delve deeper into the study of health and well-being.  I found myself reflecting on the work I had done with the Bold Beauty Project as an undergraduate, and I knew I wanted to bring this transformative initiative to Yale. After sharing the idea with Dr. Ritvo, I was met with unwavering encouragement and support. 
In fall 2024, I reached out to the executive board of Disability Empowerment in Public Health at Yale (DEPHY)—a cross-disability community of graduate students who identify as disabled, neurodivergent, chronically ill, or living with mental health conditions, as well as allies—to collaborate on bringing this vision to life. Together, we began recruiting models and photographers to develop what would become the Bold Beauty Project: Yale Edition. 
Throughout the spring semester, I’ve worked closely with our lead photographer, model coordinator, and DEPHY executive leadership team to create an immersive, visual-audio exhibition that celebrates the strength, resilience, and beauty of Yale-affiliated women living with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Featuring the work of student photographers, the exhibit will spotlight powerful portraits accompanied by written and audio narratives, offering a deeply personal window into each model and photographer’s story, inspiration, and relationship with beauty. Our goal is to use storytelling and art to redefine beauty, challenge assumptions, and broaden the narrative surrounding disability. We hope you will join us.  
The Bold Beauty Project: Yale Edition will debut as a one-night-only event on Friday, April 18, 2025, from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM at the Yale Program for Recovery and Community Health.

WINSTON-SALEM—Perhaps it was rain dripping through one of the many holes in the roof that condensed the ammonium nitrate into a potentially explosive cake.
Or maybe it was an electrical short, like the one that had occurred a month earlier, igniting a pile of fertilizer.
Regardless of the cause, on the evening of Jan. 31, 2022, the Winston Weaver fertilizer plant caught fire.
For the first two hours of a week-long siege, Winston-Salem firefighters inundated the plant with more than a half million gallons of water as they furiously tried to prevent 600 tons of ammonium nitrate—stored in wooden buildings and a rail car near a residential area—from exploding.
Meanwhile, contractors hired by Winston Weaver built a berm to contain the fire water runoff and prevent it from entering a nearby creek, according to fire officials. And for good reason: The runoff—shipped to a dairy as “off spec liquid fertilizer” and spread on fields—was later found to contain a goulash of dozens of chemicals, including toxic PFAS.
The shipment and application of the off spec fertilizer between Winston Weaver and Shady Grove Dairy has not been previously reported.
Winston Weaver’s off spec fertilizer differed from sewage sludge in that it hadn’t passed through a treatment plant. But even if the material had been treated, PFAS would not have been removed without an advanced and expensive system.
When PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge is applied to farmland, it can contaminate the soil, groundwater, drinking water supplies and food. The connection between sewage sludge and environmental contamination prompted the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to conduct a state-wide sludge survey. The agency plans to publish the results later this year, according to a DEQ.
A week before President Trump was inaugurated for a second term, the EPA published a draft risk assessment of the potential human health risks associated with PFAS in sewage sludge. The agency emphasized that people who live on PFAS-contaminated farms are at higher risk because they eat and drink what they grow.
It’s unclear how the sludge rules will fare under the Trump administration.

Many chemical industry and manufacturing trade associations oppose further restrictions on PFAS. In mid-February, 19 trade groups led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin with a wish list of PFAS rollbacks, citing what they view as the economic necessity of the compounds and the billions of dollars in cleanup costs.
The letter doesn’t specifically mention sewage sludge but it does call for a review of drinking water standards and the reclassification of PFOS and PFOA from hazardous to non-hazardous substances.
“We stand ready to work with you on these important issues,” the letter reads.
Winston Weaver contractor determined “off spec liquid fertilizer” not hazardous
After the fire at Winston Weaver, the Winston-Salem fire Department told DEQ it did not use firefighting foam that contained PFAS to fight the fire at the fertilizer plant. The source of the contamination is still unknown.
Winston Weaver shipped the fire water runoff in steel tanks to Shady Grove Dairy 20 miles away in East Bend. The farm had agreed to take the “off spec liquid fertilizer,” according to an agreement provided to Inside Climate News by state regulators. It was later spread on a field planted with corn silage to feed the cows.
Off spec liquid fertilizer is defined by state regulators as “a product that does not meet quality specifications or standards.”




PFAS are everywhere
There are tens of thousands of types of PFAS, which are found in many consumer products,as well as water-resistant clothing, furniture and personal care products. The compounds are ubiquitous, contaminating air, drinking water, fish, soil, crops, eggs and milk worldwide. PFAS even contribute to climate change by disrupting the ocean cycle and increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases.
PFAS exposure can lead to myriad serious health conditions, including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disorders, reproductive problems, high cholesterol and a depressed immune system.




Shady Grove Dairy owner Tim Smitherman did not respond to emails requesting an interview. Calls for two phone numbers listed in state records for Smitherman did not go through. Former Winston Weaver plant manager Adam Parrish did not respond to emails and a phone message.
When DEQ learned of the agreement between Shady Grove and Winston Weaver, it required sampling of the material to determine whether it would be considered hazardous before allowing it to be shipped, DEQ spokesman Josh Kastrinsky said. Consultants for Winston Weaver analyzed the data and determined it was not hazardous and could be shipped.
After consulting with the EPA, DEQ also required sampling the off spec fertilizer for the compounds.
Without a legal basis to stop the transfer and use of the off spec fertilizer at Shady Grove, the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality approved it, state records show.
At the time of the fire, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was still two years from establishing drinking water standards for any PFAS compounds, but had established a drinking water advisory of 70 ppt. Lab samples from the consultant indicated that the highest combined levels in the land-applied water of PFOA and PFOS were below 11 ppt.










“Regardless of whether or not there were PFAS in the water, it came from a fire at a manufacturing facility. It seems like there would have been other ways to dispose of it.”


– Jamie DeWitt, toxicologist


That level is now nearly three times the EPA’s drinking water standard.
There are no federal or state rules for PFAS in sewage sludge or the off spec fertilizer bound for farm fields.
More than 66,000 tons of dried sewage sludge was applied on North Carolina’s farm fields for use as fertilizer in 2023, according to state data. As scientists have learned more about how PFAS moves within the environment, they have focused on the compounds’ presence in sewage sludge because of its potential to contaminate the food supply.
“Certain things shouldn’t be applied to the land,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist who specializes in PFAS research and is a member of DEQ’s Secretaries’ Science Advisory Board. “Regardless of whether or not there were PFAS in the water, it came from a fire at a manufacturing facility. It seems like there would have been other ways to dispose of it.”
EPA’s draft evaluation for PFAS in sludge “recklessly underestimates the harm”
In cities, wastewater from homes, businesses and industries discharges to treatment plants, where it becomes sewage sludge that is usually trucked to landfills, incinerated or spread on farm fields. Eighty percent of the 50 largest wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. reported detectable levels of PFAS, according to a 2020 EPA study. The contamination primarily comes from industrial sources that don’t remove the compounds from wastewater before sending it to the plants.
PFAS are also present in some consumer products, and could enter wastewater treatment plants through washing machines, sinks and toilets.
Nationwide, the material has been used on 70 million acres of farmland, sometimes with serious consequences, according to the Environmental Working Group. In Maine, dairy cows that grazed on contaminated fields produced milk with high levels of PFAS, prompting farmers to withdraw their product from the marketplace.
Officials in Johnson County, Texas, declared a state of disaster in February because of PFAS-contaminated agricultural land, soil, groundwater, surface water and animal tissue. In North Carolina, the compounds have been detected in compost.
The EPA’s draft risk assessment for sewage sludge found human health risks exceeded acceptable thresholds when it contained 1 part per billion of PFOA or PFOS, two of the most toxic types.
The off spec fertilizer at Shady Grove contained levels of PFOA and PFOS below the EPA’s threshold of 1 part per billion, published in the draft risk assessment. However it also contained eight to 16 types of the compounds, state records show, depending on which tank was sampled.
The assessment also concludes children who live on dairy farms and drink one to two glasses of milk per day have a significantly higher risk of developing cancer later in life. Their risk of developing non-cancer health effects is also 34 times higher just from that milk than what is considered safe. Adults also face health risks.
People whose drinking water comes from sources on or near farmland polluted with PFAS are also at higher risk of developing cancer or other serious illnesses, according to the draft risk assessment.
State records show that there are several private drinking water wells near Shady Grove Dairy, and there is one on the farm itself. Roughly 1,600 feet from the nearest barn runs a stream that feeds tributaries to the Yadkin River, the drinking water supply for more than 800,000 people.
The EPA still lowballed the threat, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center attorneys Jean Zhuang and Hannah Nelson, who provided public comments on the draft risk assessment.
First, the EPA considered only two PFAS compounds: PFOA and PFOS, “when nearly 15,000 PFAS chemicals plague our environment, surface water, and groundwater,” the attorneys wrote.
Nor did the draft risk assessment account for the combined risk of multiple PFAS or the other sources of the contaminants—clothing, some cookware and consumer products.
“The assessment recklessly underestimates the harm that PFAS-polluted sludge causes to farming families—it must be amended to reflect reality. Sludge is far more polluted than the assessment assumes,” the attorneys wrote.
They also asked the EPA to require industries to pre-treat for PFAS to prevent the compounds from entering the wastewater plants and contaminating the sludge.
“Many of these families unknowingly spread contaminated sludge on their lands because they were told that it was a safe and effective way to fertilize their farms,” the SELC wrote. “Their children and family members are the ones eating the vegetables, beef, fish, fruit, milk, and eggs from their farms. Their families are the ones that have the most to lose.”
Farm has history of violations
The 1,200 cows and calves at Shady Grove Dairy outnumber the people who live in East Bend, in Yadkin County. Over the past decade, state regulators have fined the dairy more than $22,000 for several violations, including allowing cow manure to drain from a waste lagoon into a nearby creek.
The state also cited Shady Grove Dairy in connection with the off spec fertilizer, but not because it contained PFAS. Since the material originated at a fertilizer plant, levels of nitrogen, ammonia and phosphorus were astronomical. DEQ advised farmer Sterling Smitherman against over-applying the fire water runoff, documents show. The agency provided calculations to guide him on the proper application rates, Kastrinsky told Inside Climate News.
Yet when a DEQ inspector visited Shady Grove, unannounced, in March 2022, she found “severe and significant” damage to the silage field from too much nitrogen, state records show. DEQ officials later determined Smitherman “willfully” overapplied the fire water runoff and fined the farm $2,400.
Even though DEQ determined the nitrogen overload “likely” impacted groundwater and surface water immediately after the off spec fertilizer was applied, the agency did not test those areas for PFAS.
“Because the levels present were not in violation of any standards, staff did not conduct follow-up testing on surface water, land or groundwater near the site of application,” Kastrinsky said.
Those compounds could still be on the farm. “Once PFAS get onto the land, they have the potential to stay there for decades, maybe even centuries,” DeWitt said. “They have the potential to move off of that land into air and into water and get transported to other other areas, to broaden contamination and to potentially increase exposures to people living nearby that area of the land application.”
NCDA spokeswoman Andrea Ashby said DEQ did not notify agriculture department officials about the off spec fertilizer; however, Kastrinsky countered that representatives from both agencies discussed the situation.
The state Agriculture Department has not tested any dairy farms for PFAS in milk, Ashby said, because it has not received guidance from the FDA to do so. “The Department’s Food and Drug Protection lab is not set up to test for PFAS or other related chemicals as there is no science-based guidance or established standards at this time to follow for food products.”
PFAS has been detected in gardens in North Carolina. Academic scientists at several state universities tested five residential gardens near the Chemours plant in Fayetteville, a known area of contamination. One type of PFAS compound, GenX, was detected in 72 percent of the 53 samples. Crops containing higher amounts of water had higher amounts of GenX.
The FDA has made progress on testing PFAS in the food supply, according to the agency website. In February, the FDA blocked the import of canned clams from China because of elevated PFAS levels. The agency also has a valid testing method and helps states analyze foods grown, raised, or processed in known areas of contamination before they go to market.
Glenda Pereira is an assistant professor of animal science and a dairy specialist at the University of Maine. She said scientists are studying how PFAS are transferred to crops from soil or irrigation. Unpublished research results from Maine show corn silage tends to have lower levels of PFAS compared with grasses and hay.
“But if the levels in the soil are high enough, the levels in corn silage could be a concern,” Pereira said.
Pereira recommended that farmers who applied PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge on their fields test their soil. The science is still emerging on testing methods, but Maine has published PFOS soil screening levels for several crops as they’re related to dairies and milk production.
Three years after the Winston Weaver fire, the plant has been razed. DEQ reported that subsequent sampling showed the soil contained high levels of arsenic; groundwater had elevated concentrations of several chemicals, including nitrite, nitrate, and benzene—the latter of which is a known carcinogen.
The cause of the fire remains undetermined. State labor department officials fined Winston Weaver $5,600 for violations that could have contributed to the blaze.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Weaver-Fertilizer-fire-WS-Fire-Dept-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 13:15:30.549333

Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, said to the House Civil Law Committee while presenting one of six so-called […]","Getty ImagesHouse lawmakers advanced six bills targeting personal injury lawsuits Tuesday in the opening salvo of the Louisiana Legislature’s ongoing debate over high insurance rates. 
“I guess we can say this is opening day, and here’s your first pitch,” Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, said to the House Civil Law Committee while presenting one of six so-called tort reform bills the committee considered Tuesday. 
Out of the six bills, one of the most hotly contested would limit the ability for people to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault. House Bill 431 sponsored by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, cleared the committee in an 11-4 vote along party lines. 
Her bill would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. The statute often arises in cases that involve multiple negligent acts by multiple people, some more to blame than others. 
In theory, someone partly at fault for an accident can potentially recover some of the awarded damages. Chenevert’s bill would change that to prohibit any amount of recovery by a party who’s 51% or more at fault. 
“You should not be able to collect if the accident is mostly your fault,” Chenevert said. “I would say that’s common sense. Should we reward negligence?”
But Rep. Chad Brown, D-Plaquemine, pointed out that the bill only modifies comparative fault on the plaintiff’s side and not the defendant’s. As a result, a defendant would still be protected by the liability proportions. 
“There’s a double standard here that the plaintiff is going to get zeroes if he’s 51% at fault, and the defendant is only gonna pay 51% if he’s 51% at fault,” said Brown, who is an attorney. “… The plaintiff is more imperiled than the defendant.”
Chenevert said 34 other states have a version of the law.
The committee similarly advanced House Bill 34, sponsored by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, in a 11-3 vote. His measure would change state law to allow any party to introduce evidence related to medical expenses. 
Currently, the law prevents juries from seeing what accident victims actually pay for medical treatment and only allows them to see what a doctor billed. In many instances, however, medical providers don’t actually receive the full amounts that they bill. At other times, Glorioso said, some lawyers work with doctors who inflate their medical billings just to get an increased payout for the plaintiff. 
Glorioso’s bill would limit a claimant’s recovery of medical expenses to “reasonable” amounts, which would be left for a judge or jury to decide. 
“Let’s let the jury see all of the evidence,” he said. “Let’s not blindfold them and just let them see one side.”
Brown countered, saying defendants get to hide details from jurors, such as whether insurance coverage is available for injuries a victim claims. He said he supports leveling the playing field between plaintiffs and insurance companies.
The committee saw Republicans prevail in another vote on House Bill 443, sponsored by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley. His bill would require plaintiffs to notify defendants of an intent to file a lawsuit within 10 days of retaining a lawyer. 
Currently, plaintiffs’ lawyers can gather evidence and prepare for a lawsuit for almost two full years before a defendant is even aware a suit is coming. Henry said his bill would give a defendant the same amount of time to prepare for a claim as a plaintiff..
Democrats on the committee said if plaintiffs will be required to provide such a notice, then defendants should at least be required to respond to that notice with similar information – such as contact information for the insurance company’s lawyer and claims adjuster. 
Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, said many of the insurance companies he deals with in his law practice won’t return calls or even provide email addresses for anyone at the company. 
Rep. Nick Muscarello, R-Hammond, questioned how the requirement would even be enforced and encouraged Henry to work with the concerned lawmakers on potential amendments before the bill is debated on the House floor. Henry said he would.
House Bill 434, sponsored by Rep. Jason DeWitt, R-Alexandria, advanced to the floor in an 11-2 vote but saw no debate. The proposal would limit bodily injury claims by plaintiffs who did not carry auto insurance at the time of the accident. It also would forbid uninsured plaintiffs’ recovery on the first $100,000 worth of damages. 
Other bills the committee advanced include House Bill 450, sponsored by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, and House Bill 291, sponsored by Gallé. 
Melerine’s bill would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Lawmakers have tried repeatedly to revoke Housley, but those attempts either failed or were vetoed in previous years. This year is expected to be different as Gov. Jeff Landry recently signaled support for the measure. 
Gallé’s bill would extend the filing deadline, called a “prescriptive period,” for wrongful death lawsuits from one year to two, aligning Louisiana with the deadline found in most other states. 
Proponents of the bill have argued that a shorter prescriptive period attracts more frivolous lawsuits by essentially forcing people to quickly file claims so as to not lose their litigation rights. The proposal also complements a similar measure lawmakers approved last year to extend the deadline for filing personal injury claims.   
The committee quickly advanced both bills without objection.

Delaware continues to make gains in improving air quality, according to the 2023 Annual Air Quality Report released by the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
The report, based on data from the DNREC Division of Air Quality’s statewide monitoring network, shows most pollutants remained below federal limits — though ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remain persistent concerns.
The report highlights that in 2023, Delaware experienced 353 days — over 96% of the year — with air quality rated as “good” or “moderate” on the federal Air Quality Index (AQI).
However, widespread Canadian wildfires during the spring and early summer triggered several days of elevated ozone and PM2.5 levels, temporarily impacting air quality across the state.

“Even with environmental challenges beyond our control and coming our way as happened with wildfire smoke, Delaware’s air quality data continue to show steady progress,” said DNREC Division of Air Quality Director Angela Marconi. “This reflects not only decades of work to reduce emissions locally, but also our state’s ongoing collaboration in regional efforts to be key in delivering cleaner air and having a significant impact toward healthier communities.”
Despite the wildfire-related setbacks, state officials say the long-term outlook remains positive.
Air toxics in Wilmington, the state’s most industrialized area, remained low or declined further.
Most pollutants continued to meet or fall below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), with the exception of ozone and PM2.5 — both known to be exacerbated by high temperatures and pollution from vehicles and industry.
“The story of Delaware’s air is one of significant and steady progress over the years,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson. “We still have challenges however, ones that affect the health of both our people and the planet. That’s why we need policies, programs and tools in place to reduce emissions and pollutants and continue to make Delaware’s air even cleaner.”
One point of clarification in the report addresses Delaware’s ozone classification.
While New Castle County is listed as “Serious Non-Attainment” for ozone, DNREC says the designation stems from its inclusion in the broader Philadelphia Non-Attainment Area — not from local pollution.
All three Delaware counties currently meet federal air quality standards for all major pollutants.
The state’s monitoring system, paired with public communication tools like AirNow.gov and DNREC’s own air data portal (de.gov/airdata), allows for real-time tracking of air quality and health alerts when pollution levels rise.

I shouldn’t need to re-introduce myself to you, but I’m Paige Sullivan. I’m a native and lifelong resident of North Carolina. I’m also transgender and a former classmate of yours. We shared the same public school hallways for twelve years. We had many of the same teachers, though never in the same classroom at the same time.

Brad, what are you doing? I was shocked when I saw your name on this bill. You were always a go-getter in school, but I never thought you’d put your name on a bathroom bill like Senate Bill 516. Have you considered the implications of the bills you have sponsored? 
Can you all please explain to us how a person with a beard and a deep voice, who’s been on testosterone, belongs in the women’s room? What protections would you offer a transgender woman who is forced to use the men’s room? What will happen when someone needs to take their child or aging relative to the restroom and of a different gender? There are many other scenarios to consider, and this bill will hurt many people. 
Secondly, why is there a restriction on changing our birth certificates and driver’s licenses? Is that a personal dig at me, perchance? It’s no one’s business, especially the government’s, of what’s between our legs. On top of that, you have no idea how the transition process works. For me, it has taken the better part of twenty years. I’ve had psychological evaluations, relating directly to my gender identity, by doctors over a few years. I’ve been on estradiol injections for twelve years. I’ve had five surgeries. You don’t just walk into a clinic and have reassignment surgery. 
Okay, let’s move on to Senate Bill 227. By banning DEI programs, you’re not eliminating bias but codifying it. Students deserve to learn the full scope of American history, including the lives of Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and immigrant communities. Silencing these narratives doesn’t protect kids—it denies them the tools to understand the world they’re growing up in. We went to overwhelmingly “white” schools, but you had at least three racial minorities in your graduating class. Maybe you should ask them what they think of this bill. Explain to them that because they are a racial minority, other kids shouldn’t learn about their history or struggles for freedom and equal rights. 
What’s the real reason? Brad, I know you are better than this. Stand on the right side of history. Don’t let party politics close your eyes to the harm these bills will cause. Think of your Christian beliefs. Would Jesus stand for this? I invite you to read Matthew 25:34-35, Luke 14:13, and the many teachings that call us toward justice and mercy. I’m not asking you to change overnight. I’m asking you to listen, to remember who I am, and to lead with compassion. 
We were taught in civics class that we are equal—did you forget that? Would you like me to contact some of our former teachers to provide a refresher course on the foundational documents of our country and state? I know one who would do it in a heartbeat for you. 
Brad, you and I learned the same lessons about fairness, equality, and civic responsibility. I’m not asking for a debate. I’m asking for humanity. You may not accept my meeting request, but I hope you’ll receive this: Laws like SB 516 and SB 227 harm real people.

That evening, from the window of the police car, Gonzalez spotted a man sitting on the Water Street Bridge. Within moments, she and the officer received a call. The man she’d seen on the bridge was threatening to jump.
“My legs went completely numb,” Gonzalez said. 
But she got straight to work. While the officer attended to the man, Gonzalez called an emergency psychiatric care team, known as mobile crisis. 
She also connected with the man’s family as they arrived at her location, answering questions and helping them understand the process. Gonzalez recalled telling the man’s grandmother about the dive team waiting in the water and pointing out the ambulance ready to rush him to a medical facility.
Sgt. Nick Rankin, supervisor for the Community Policing Unit in Norwich, said it was the type of situation where the presence of a social worker is particularly useful. 
Often, officers on a scene are so focused on the individual in crisis, they’re not able to assist family members, Rankin said. “So having the ability to pass them to a social worker that’s going to be there and be helpful for them — that’s invaluable.” 
Rankin also serves as director of police social work for the Social Work Law Enforcement Project, where Gonzalez was among the first interns.
The project was founded in August 2020, a few months after the mass protests against the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police, and immediately after the Connecticut legislature passed a wide-ranging law regulating various aspects of policing. The law included a requirement for local police departments to conduct a study on whether social workers could respond to certain calls either independently of or alongside police officers. 
The co-founders of the Social Work Law Enforcement Project — Isabel Logan, then a professor of social work at Eastern Connecticut State University, and Matthew Solak, a lieutenant with the Willimantic Police Department — said after they shared their model with a task force on police accountability and transparency in 2021, other professional schools and police departments began reaching out. 
Soon the program, which they had been running for free, was too large to sustain without additional help, Logan said. So they’re seeking help from the state. 
This year, the legislature is considering a bill that would establish a social work and law enforcement institute at Southern Connecticut State University, where Logan now teaches. The bill sets aside $2.2 million in both 2026 and 2027 to support the program. 
“ So the difference is that now it’ll turn from just my research to an institute that will be able to provide the resources that we need to be able to deliver the services at a bigger scale,” she said. 
Understanding how each other work
Logan had worked as a social worker in the court system for 20 years when she and Solak developed the concept to integrate social workers into police departments. 
The model focuses on three separate components of social work: helping individuals who have a run-in with the police through de-escalation or providing services; community engagement; and data collection and advocating for local and state policies. Interns who are placed with the police departments go through a week-long training focused on things like ethics, policy and safety.
One of the most critical components of her program, Logan said, was training police officers and social workers together, so they each understand how the other operates. 
Within roughly a year of the program’s lanch, other local police departments, including Milford and Norwich, had signed on along with five universities in the state. Logan said the organization sends between six and 13 social work interns to police departments in a year, and that 23 people have graduated from their program. 
Still, when Logan called up Rankin in Norwich about the program in 2021, he said he was a little leery at first — he liked the idea, but it was a tense time for police officers and he wasn’t sure how much the program might interfere with the department’s normal operations.
But Rankin recalled, as a young officer, that he’d had the opportunity to ride along with clinicians, and he said he’d learned things like how to recognize certain mental health diagnoses and what questions to ask people struggling with those conditions. He thought it could be useful for Norwich officers to learn similar things. 
“[Social workers] only see all the bad things happening to the person. [Police] only see all the bad things the person’s doing as a result.” 
Capt. Garon DelMonte with the Milford Police Department said he was immediately on board with the idea. Social workers are able to follow up with people in the community, something an officer wouldn’t do, he said. 
“Law enforcement obviously needed something, especially post-George Floyd. We were struggling to really kind of close the gaps back with our community. So this just seemed like a really … holistic approach to law enforcement that could better serve the people of our community, because we can be so limited at times,” he said.
Building relationships
Tina Marie James, now a full-time social worker with Milford’s Police Department, is still in contact with the first person she got a call about as an intern. The person was homeless and struggling with alcoholism. James went to the encampment where he was living.
“I met with him and, and I said to him … ‘If I could wave my magical wand’ — we say that often, as social workers — ‘what could I possibly provide you support with?’” Working together with the client, James said she was able to help him find housing, and he went on to mend his relationship with his daughter.
James said for people facing overlapping challenges like homelessness, substance abuse and mental health issues, it can be triggering to come face-to-face with a police officer. “They see a police officer, [and] what’s coming into their mind — They’re going to go to jail, they’re going to be arrested, they’re not going to be treated well,” James said. 
“Developing the relationships with the officers and going out and having the conversation, letting them know that we are here together as a unit — not necessarily because they’re here to arrest you. They’re here for your safety, they’re here for my safety. And it has helped a lot,” she said.
Milford Capt. DelMonte said one of the signs that the social work program was having a positive effect was a decrease in calls from people he called “frequent callers” — individuals who have regular psychological episodes that end in a call to the police. DelMonte said that while police might get the person to the hospital, they wouldn’t normally follow up beyond that.
A social worker, on the other hand, can. “We’ve had members in this community that have called us 50, 60, a hundred times for help, that once the social workers became ingrained with those people, they haven’t called us since,” he said.  
Both the police officers and the social workers said they felt social workers acted as a bridge to improve trust within their communities. 
Rankin said if lawmakers approve the funding and establish the institute at SCSU, the program would be able to standardize the training and requirements for a field that is growing.
“It’s a developing field, so you need to establish best practices.,” Rankin said. “There needs to be somebody to look to and go, ‘Who’s going to provide the training? Who’s going to do the research? Who’s going to find out what works best and why?’ And then disseminate that information.”
The proposal has been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the legislature.
Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, who is a police officer, noted during a press conference in March that police were having to deal with more and more calls regarding mental illness, which required someone who could follow-up with those people.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, a social worker, called the combination of social work and law enforcement “more important now than ever.” 
The bill has passed out of the legislature’s Public Safety Committee and is waiting to be heard in the House of Representatives. 
For Gonzalez, who now works for the Department of Veterans Affairs, one of the most salient lessons she said she learned during her internship was that police work and social work aren’t all that different. The best thing police officers and social workers can do is show the community that they work as a unit, she said.
“ Social workers are everywhere. They’re in hospitals, they’re in the military, they’re everywhere. So why can’t we be here? I learned that we can be here … and work together,” she said.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Photo by Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity, and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota, and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.


DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

Bussman ousted longtime 7th District chair Craig Bishop, a staffer for U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, in a contest that far-right activist group Action 4 Liberty characterized as a “MASSIVE rebuke on the corrupt, anti-grassroots, and anti-liberty tactics CD7 has used to protect RINO politicians,” meaning, “Republicans in Name Only.” 
Many of Bussman’s views have become commonplace on the fringes of the Republican party, including vaccine skepticism, election denial, January 6 revisionism and a general hostility toward established science.
But a Reformer review of Bussman’s social media accounts finds that he has espoused many outlandish conspiracy theories that go well beyond standard conservative activist fare. 
He has posted about “satanic chemtrails” in the skies above Minnesota.
He has argued that the collapse of a World Trade Center building during the 9/11 terror attacks was the result of a “controlled demolition,” and that a “cruise missile,” rather than American Airlines Flight 77, struck the Pentagon that day.
He has shared multiple videos arguing that the moon landings were faked, and that more recent footage of astronauts aboard the International Space Station was faked as well.
He has shared with followers a video entitled “5 Reasons Why I BELIEVE in the Flat Earth (And You Should Too!),” as well as numerous other videos claiming that the earth is flat.
Bussman’s elevation to a leadership position is part of a statewide pattern that alarms longtime Republican activists: The party is allowing itself to be taken over by the fringe, lowering the odds of victory in future statewide elections.
“It’s bad for Republicans who want to win,” said Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of the Minnesota GOP who has vehemently opposed the party’s embrace of Donald Trump and figures like him, going so far as to publicly endorse Kamala Harris last year. “This is what happens when party leadership opens the gates of the insane asylum, and people come in off the streets and the inmates run it.”
On the fringes of the fringe
Bussman’s Facebook posts demonstrate a longstanding interest in multiple extreme fringe theories. On May 8, 2023, he posted a video purporting to show “leaked footage of our flat earth from 1977,” showing an obviously computer-generated animation of a dim sun traversing flat icy terrain.
A year later he shared a video stating that a pilot “proved” the earth is flat because the sun and the moon were visible in the sky at the same time, a phenomenon which occurs on most days.
And on August 14, 2024, he posted the “5 Reasons Why” video about flat earth, which asks, among other things, that if the Earth is actually spinning, “why aren’t we all being flung out into space?” 
Bussman has similarly posted multiple videos purporting to prove that the moon landings and other parts of the U.S. space program have been “faked.” He has shared video of an actor pretending to be film director Stanley Kubrick admitting that “he was responsible for faking the US Moon Program,” as well as a lengthy video claiming the landings were a “hoax” based on various false and spurious claims about film footage of them.
He has repeatedly suggested that a celestial structure called “the firmament” prevents space travel, which is a common trope among many flat-earthers.
Bussman’s conspiracy theorizing extends to world events like the 9/11 attacks as well. On March 22, 2024, he posted a conspiracy video and asked a skeptical follower “Have you seen the video of building 7 collapsing and the cruise missle [sic] hit the pentagon? I had a friend invomved [sic] in the clean up of the towers- no plane wreckage.” He has posted several other videos containing similar sentiments.
Reached by the Reformer for comment, Bussman did not deny that he was an adherent of any of the conspiracy theories that he posted about on his public Facebook profile. “You can print whatever you want,” he said. “I spent 20+ years in the Army defending that right, but if you do that, there would be no chance of me speaking with you in the future.”
The more moderate wing of the Minnesota Republican party has been attempting, mostly in vain, to keep people like Bussman away from the levers of power. Much of the energy propelling Bussman and similar candidates comes from Action 4 Liberty, a far-right group that has made a name for itself mostly by attacking elected Republicans for being insufficiently far right.
Brodkorb argues that the extent of the party’s extremism problem became clear in 2024, when it nominated Alex Jones acolyte Royce White to take on Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar in the U.S. Senate race, and Republicans in the 7th Congressional District refused to endorse Fischbach — one of the more conservative representatives in the entire U.S. House — for reelection. Fischbach nevertheless sailed to victory over her primary opponent by nearly 30 percentage points, a sign that the fringe elements taking over the party lack widespread support among GOP voters.
“Bussman has nothing on his resume that has ever shown that he can organize and win,” Brodkorb says. “That hurts Republicans statewide.” 
A Republican victory in a statewide race, for instance, will require running up the margins in reliably conservative places like the 7thDistrict. Bussman’s inexperience and fringe beliefs make that much harder to do. 
“Those views shut down conversations and alienate people inside the party,” Brodkorb said.
Bussman and his ilk will also likely alienate more moderate, independent voters in the suburbs and exurbs, which Republicans need if they are ever to overcome the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s numerical advantage, evidenced by the GOP’s two decade long losing streak. 
Bussman, for his part, is critical of people who don’t “do their own research” and endorse the same conspiracy theories he does.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)This story first appeared on the Maine Morning Star.
The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which the U.S. attorney general said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a news conference, adding that it is an issue of sports as well as safety.
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
In response to the suit, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said it’s the “latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law.”
“This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said.
Mills said that her administration “will vigorously defend our state” against the Department of Justice’s lawsuit.
Title IX case against Maine schools headed to US Department of Justice

On Friday, the Maine Attorney General’s Office sent a letter to the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights saying it would not comply with the proposed resolution agreement, which would require the state to end its transgender protections. The state also doubled down on its assertion that the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX does not have legal standing.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby appeared at the Wednesday morning news conference alongside Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The Auburn Republican has been at the center of this controversy. After sharing photos and identifying information about a transgender student athlete on her legislative Facebook page, she was censured by her peers and stripped of the right to vote or speak on the Maine House floor until she apologizes.
That post went viral and prompted the Trump administration’s scrutiny of Maine’s policy.
Bondi read off two examples of trans girls placing in girls athletic competitions, skiing and track, and recounted the initial exchange between President Donald Trump and Mills during which the Democratic governor said she’d see Trump “in court.”
Bondi also noted that two federal departments, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, deemed Maine in violation of Title IX after brief investigations into the matter.
“We have exhausted every other remedy,” Bondi said of the suit. “We tried to get Maine to comply. We don’t like standing up here and filing lawsuits, we want to get states to comply with us.”
Bondi pointed to the many ways the federal government has punished Maine. “We’ve stripped grants from Maine through other departments and we are going to continue to fight for women,” she said.
Mills also spoke to what she described as the “politically motivated investigations that opened and closed without discussion” and referenced Friday’s federal court order requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to unfreeze payments related to Maine’s school meal programs, which the governor said “reinforces our position that the federal government has been acting unlawfully.”
“Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,” Mills concluded.

The federal government has said people will need Real ID compliant credentials starting May 7 to board domestic flights and enter certain federal buildings. With […],"A sample Maine Driver's license provided by the Maine Secretary of State's Office. A little more than a quarter of driver’s licenses or identification cards issued by Maine’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles meet the federal requirements for what’s known as a Real ID.
The federal government has said people will need Real ID compliant credentials starting May 7 to board domestic flights and enter certain federal buildings. With that deadline less than a month away, some Maine lawmakers believe low participation in the state is not due to ignorance but rather is an “informed resistance.” 
While the policy was meant to increase security in the wake of 9/11, Democrats and Republicans in Maine have concerns about government overreach, personal privacy and the potential for data breaches. 
Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) shares in those concerns, which is why she introduced LD 160 to repeal the law that allows the Maine Secretary of State to issue a driver’s license or other identification card that meets the standards of the Real ID Act of 2005. 
“It reflects our state’s deep-rooted skepticism of federal mandates that infringe on civil liberties and a recognition that government should exist to serve and protect its citizens, not to catalog, track or intrude upon their lawful activities,” Libby told the Legislature’s Transportation Committee during a public hearing Tuesday. 
To obtain a Real ID, people must have documentation showing their full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, proof of address and lawful status. This is often satisfied with a birth certificate, Social Security card and proof of current address, such as a utility bill. 
Libby acknowledged that people must already prove their residency to obtain a non-compliant ID, but she’s worried about the other components, especially the Social Security number. She said the law is a “dangerous consolidation of personal information.”
Collecting and storing people’s personal data increases the risk for data breaches and identity theft, she argued. She also said it acts as a “de facto national identification system,” which contradicts the principles of federalism and individual freedoms.
Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock), a co-sponsor of the bill, said one of the most alarming components of Real ID is that it creates a shared database between states. She fears it could create a one-stop shop for hackers and identity thieves. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows clarified that Maine is required to keep the data people bring in for their Real IDs, but the information sharing is meant to allow other states to see if someone already holds a license or Real ID elsewhere. 
A few years after the Real ID Act was passed, Maine made a bipartisan decision to reject the implementation of the policy. However, the Legislature reversed course in 2017 after the federal government threatened to limit Mainers’ ability to board flights and access federal buildings. 
Currently, Mainers can choose whether they want a driver’s license or identification card that complies with the Real ID requirements. 
However, Libby said repealing the current policy would reduce the bureaucratic burden on the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, eliminate unnecessary costs and data storage vulnerabilities, as well as protect Mainers from potential federal overreach. 
States cannot supersede federal law so while Libby’s bill would bar the Maine Secretary of State from being able to issue compliant credentials, it would not stop the Department of Homeland Security from requiring Mainers to have Real ID compliant documentation to board flights or access federal buildings. In that case, Mainers could use federally issued identification such as a passport. 
The Real ID requirement has been pushed back multiple times in the 20 years since the policy was adopted, but is scheduled to take effect next month. 
Twenty years ago, Bellows said she urged the Maine Legislature not to move forward with Real ID requirements in Maine. In fact, she still believes the federal government should repeal it for many of the same reasons Libby listed about personal privacy and the disproportionate burden it places on married women who change their names. 
Bellows explained that it can be difficult for people who change their name if their current identification card doesn’t match the name on their birth certificate. Those individuals need to show a paper trail of the change. 
However, Bellows opposes LD 160 because she thinks it’s important for Mainers to be able to choose whether they want a Real ID. Bellows said the Legislature’s decision to make it optional for Mainers was “wise.”
If this proposal passes, Bellows said it would make Maine the only state in the union unable to issue its citizens a federally accepted credential. 
Though the participation rate has been low, Bellows said Bureau of Motor Vehicle branches have seen record traffic in the past few months, with more than eight out 10 people seeking a driver’s license or ID card wanting Real IDs. 
Even with the increased traffic and long wait times, Bellows said it is still cheaper and faster for people to get a state-issued Real ID than a passport. 
The ACLU of Maine and the Maine Policy Institute support the bill.

(Photo courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says.
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis.
That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring.
But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said.
Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.

(Photo courtesy of DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating a fish kill near Fort Dodge, caused by a leak of a fertilizer byproduct, according a press release. 
The spill reached the South Branch of Lizard Creek, where DNR staff observed dead fish for several miles and the byproduct, causing brown, murky water stretched around seven road-miles downstream from the facility involved.
DNR received a call Monday from CJ Bio America, reporting that byproduct from making lysine, which the company manufactures as an amino acid for animal feed, had leaked from the facility into a stormwater channel. 
Dan Bratrud, an environmental specialist with DNR said the byproduct is typically used as a soil amendment and in its current state is “high in ammonia and quite corrosive.” 
DNR reported that the company believed the byproduct had been contained via a berm in the stormwater channel, but later discovered a breach in the berm allowed an unknown amount of the byproduct to flow into surface intakes of a neighboring field. From the surface intakes, the byproduct flowed to the South Branch of Lizard Creek.
Bratrud said the water was too murky early in the week to perform a fish kill count, but said Wednesday the fisheries team was at the site to count.
“Hopefully we can get some more information gathered,” Bratrud said, noting he and other staff were headed to the site. 
According to the department, the leak was stopped Monday, but flow rates in the creek have made it not possible for staff to place berms to contain the byproduct in the creek. 
This is the first reported fish kill in this stream, according to DNR’s water quality database.
DNR staff collected water samples from the site and will continue to investigate the spill. Creek users downstream of the event are advised to avoid the creek.

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols) Mark Totten, a former U.S. attorney, has declared his candidacy to be Michigan’s next attorney general, becoming the first Democrat to declare for the position. 
Totten was nominated by former President Joe Biden to be the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan, a post he served in from May 2022 through January 2025. Totten previously served as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s chief legal counsel from 2019 to 2022. He taught criminal law at Michigan State University from 2009 to 2018. 
With sitting Attorney General Dana Nessel unable to run again in 2026 due to term limits, the race for Michigan’s top legal office will likely be hotly contested.
Totten led Whitmer’s legal fight to protect reproductive freedom after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. In his role as U.S. Attorney, Totten prosecuted two men from Nigeria in an international sextortion scheme that led to the suicide of 17-year-old Jordan DeMay, as well as Rashad Trice, who was convicted in August for the murdering  2-year-old Wynter Cole-Smith and sexually assaulting her mother. 
“On January 20th, my term of service as U.S. attorney came to an end. And  since then I have watched in horror as a president has stoked division, trampled civil rights and undermined the very rule of law. I refuse to stand by and watch and that’s why I’m running for attorney general: to fight for you and to fight for everything we hold dear,” Totten said in a video announcing his candidacy.

The Trump administration announced Wednesday it is suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which the U.S. Attorney General said violates federal anti-discrimination protections.
“The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports, pretty basic stuff,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a press conference, adding that it is an issue of women’s sports as well as safety. 
The Justice Department is launching a civil suit against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools on the basis of sex. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby appeared at the Wednesday morning press conference alongside Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The Auburn Republican has been at the center of this controversy. After sharing photos and identifying information about a transgender student athlete on her legislative Facebook page, she was censured by her peers and stripped of her right to vote or speak on the Maine House floor until she apologizes. 
That post went viral and prompted the Trump administration’s scrutiny of Maine’s policy.
Bondi read off two examples of trans girls placing in girls athletic competitions, skiing and track, and recounted the initial exchange between President Donald Trump and Gov. Janet Mills during which the Democratic president said she’d see Trump “in court.”
She also noted that two federal departments, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, deemed Maine in violation of Title IX after brief investigations into the matter.
“We have exhausted every other remedy,” Bondi said of the suit. “We tried to get Maine to comply. We don’t like standing up here and filing lawsuits, we want to get states to comply with us.”
Bondi also noted the many ways the federal government has punished Maine. “We’ve stripped grants from Maine through other departments and we are going to continue to fight for women,” she said.
On Friday, the Maine Attorney General’s Office sent a letter to the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights saying it would not comply with the proposed resolution agreement, which would require the state to end its transgender protections. The state also doubled down on its assertion that the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX does not have legal standing.
In a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster pointed to legal precedent that has required schools to allow trans athletes to participate on teams aligning with their gender identity.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”

Gov. Laura Kelly signed it. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A new Kansas law adopts the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism — a definition that has been criticized for conflating criticism of the state of Israel with antisemitism. 
The legislature passed and Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bill that declares antisemitism, as defined by IRHA, is “against the public policy of this state, including, but not limited to, the purposes of public educational institutions and law enforcement agencies in this state.”
David Soffer with the Combat Antisemitism Movement said that a clause in the definition prevents conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism. 
“It does differentiate the fact that criticism of Israel is perfectly OK, as long as it is held to the same standard that you would criticize another country,” Soffer said. “We know that there are criticisms of Israel’s own government amongst its people because it is a democracy, no different than here in the United States.” 
The definition reads that “manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.”
Jack Goldstein with the Jewish Voice for Peace of Kansas City said the clause is vague. 
One example of antisemitism the IHRA provides is “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
“We’ve seen the definition be leveraged to silence voices that are dissenting against Israel for reasons that would be fair to critique other countries,” Goldstein said. “For example, their aggression in the Middle East.” 
Goldstein is referencing the Israel-Hamas war that sparked campus protests last May, which notably led to the detainment of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil.
President Donald Trump recently adopted the IHRA’s definition in an executive order, which has been used to strip funding from Columbia University over claims that the school failed to address antisemitism.  
“The main purpose of a bill like this is to shut down opposition to Israel on college campuses,” Goldstein said. “Especially with the Republicans in power right now, that is within their interest, to silence dissent like that. Especially when our country is tied to Israel and still sending lots of money and weapons to the country.”
Senate Bill 44 passed the Kansas House and Senate with bipartisan support. A similar bill in Missouri faced more pushback from Democrats. 
Soffer said the main purpose of the bill is to ensure Jewish students are not threatened or harassed. He referenced the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas on Israel. The 1,200 Israeli deaths and 250 hostages taken that day triggered an intense war.
“There was an event at (the University of Kansas) where they held a survivor from Oct. 7th, and groups stormed that event and harassed the individual that was there and the students themselves,” Soffer said. “So the question one must ask is, ‘Why can’t they even hold an event?’ ” 
The new Kansas law states the definition is “non-legally binding,” meaning it’s not enforceable in court.
Michael Rebne was on the Roeland Park City Commission when it passed an ordinance adopting the IHRA definition, and he heard supporters point to the fact that it’s not legally binding. 
“It ends up actually having the force of something that’s legally binding,” Rebne said. “As the mayor said, in Roeland Park, this will be a way to advise the police of any potential acts of antisemitism within Roeland Park.” 
With the new state law, Rebne, who is a teacher in the Kansas City, Kansas, public school district, said he is worried for his students — both Jewish and Palestinian. Rebne said the law makes teachers fearful to teach about the subject at all, even stating data about the number of people killed. 
“It doesn’t allow students to really wrestle with geopolitics, and decide for themselves what they see,” Rebne said. “Because if teachers are afraid, whether it’s legally binding or not, to bring up the topic of Israel because even touching on it may be seen as antisemitic then students also miss out on it. They’re our seeds of our democracy, if we hope to have a multi-racial democracy, that we have to educate.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100001-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-16 10:02:49.064037

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)The federal judge overseeing the lawsuit between New Mexico, Texas and Colorado over Rio Grande water has ordered a 10-day trial in Philadelphia starting June 9 at the request of all the parties, who are also pursuing mediation talks to resolve the lawsuit in the meantime.
The case, officially called Original No. 141 Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado, began more than a decade ago, sparked by escalating legal disputes around Rio Grande water below Elephant Butte between Texas and New Mexico.
The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the federal government — which operates a network of dams, and nearly 140 miles of irrigation canals to deliver water to two irrigation districts in the region and Mexico — to enter as a party to the case in 2018.
In the February status hearings, the federal mediator and attorneys for all three parties told United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Chief Judge D. Brooke Smith, who is overseeing the case, that they were still seeking a resolution to the 12-year old case.
Jeffrey Wechsler, the lead attorney representing New Mexico, said setting a trial date would help mediation talks.
“Deadlines help negotiations rather than hinder them,” Wechsler said, according to transcripts of the hearing.
The New Mexico Department of Justice and other parties’ attorneys confirmed to Source NM that mediation talks are ongoing as of April, with another mediation session scheduled for April 22, according to NMDOJ Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez. “Meanwhile, the trial—focused on determining liability and establishing a baseline for apportionment under the compact—remains on schedule,” she wrote in a statement, “if an agreement is not reached by then.”
Any potential settlement or recommendation from Smith based on a trial would still need approval from the U.S. Supreme Court, the only court that handles interstate waters disputes.
Last year, U.S. Supreme Court justices struck down a deal proposed by New Mexico, Colorado and Texas to end the litigation in a close 5-4 decision. They sided with objections from the federal government that the states’ deal unfairly excluded the “unique federal interests,” and sent the case back to the negotiation table and potentially trial.
The alliances between the state and federal government in the case have dramatically shifted since 2022 as the nature of the dispute changed. Initially, Texas and the federal government agreed that New Mexico pumping below Elephant Butte threatened Rio Grande water for both Texas irrigation and treaty obligations to Mexico.
However, since Colorado, New Mexico and Texas proposed a deal to measure Texas’ water at the state line and include transfers of water between New Mexico and Texas irrigation districts to balance out shortfalls, the federal government is going to have to build its own case.
“Texas and the United States are no longer aligned,” federal attorney Thomas Snodgrass told Smith in February. He said the federal government was still preparing a case that New Mexico should be held liable for groundwater pumping impacts on the Rio Grande since 1938.
The court already held one part of a two-part trial in October 2021, but the proposed settlement delayed the second part indefinitely.
Weschler told Smith in February that if the case does proceed to trial in June, it will be shorter than the three-months set aside for trial in 2021.
“The case is prepared for trial. In fact, it’s halfway through trial,” Weschler said. “We’ve completed our discovery, we’ve completed disclosures — there’s really not much more to do other than to begin.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Three Alaska Native tribes have filed a lawsuit to overturn the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit granted to a company seeking to dredge for gold in a sensitive wetland area near Nome.
The tribes, in their complaint filed on April 10 in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, said the Corps had erred by issuing a wetlands-ill permit to Nevada-based IPOP Ltd.
The company is seeking to dredge for gold in Bonanza Channel, a section of Safety Sound, about 20 miles east of Nome.
The Corps granted a permit to IPOP in March 2024, reversing its 2022 permit denial.
In their lawsuit, the Village of Solomon, Native Village of Council and King Island Native Community said the project threatens fish, birds and other natural resources important to Native subsistence practices in the region. Safety Sound, which is fed by four rivers, is “rich in biological diversity” and is a place where people fish, collect eggs, pick berries and gather greens, and hunt birds, seals and other game.
The Corps’ initial denial was the correct decision, the complaint said; it noted that other federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service, found numerous faults in the IPOP plan.
In a statement released by Earthjustice, the environmental law firm representing the three tribes, one of the tribal leaders said Bonanza Channel is important to Native culture and identity.
“This land and its waters are who we are. Now, the IPOP mine threatens to destroy them. Every local organization opposes this project — ask anyone who lives here. We must stand united in our resistance,” Kirsten Timbers, president of the Village of Solomon, said in the statement.
The tribes’ lawsuit follows a March 11 decision by a state agency to reject IPOP’s request for a different permit that is also necessary for the project to start.
The Alaska Division of Mining, Land and Water — part of the state Department of Natural Resources — denied IPOP’s application for a land-use permit and rejected its plan for reclamation.
While IPOP cannot go forward without that DNR permit, the plaintiffs wanted to overturn the Corps permit as well, said Carole Holley, an Earthjustice attorney representing the tribes
It is possible that IPOP could appeal the DNR rejection or reapply for that permit, she said by email.
“The Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, unless overturned, would be in place until the year 2030. Our clients contend the permit was illegally approved and that any mining that would occur within Bonanza Channel would permanently harm the ecosystem and thus, their traditional lifeways.  With the mining paused, our clients are able to challenge the permit and hopefully get a ruling before any permanent damage can be done,” she said.
A spokesperson for the Corps’ Hawaii-based Pacific Ocean Division, which issued the permit to IPOP, declined to comment on the tribes’ lawsuit.
Nahaku McFadden, regional director of public affairs for the division, said the policy is to not comment on pending litigation.
The IPOP project has an unusual history. It was originally pitched as the setting for a reality TV show called “Rivers of Gold.” The sponsors of the project also said they intended to create a luxury gold brand and tosell clothing, souvenirs and jewelry imprinted with a Rivers of Gold logo.
IPOP representatives were not available for comment.

Larry Rhoden hasn’t said whether he’s running to keep his office next year, but his actions during the first few months of his administration suggest he could reshuffle expectations for the race if he decides to join it.
“Whether we can win is certainly a consideration, and truth be told, I’ve been receiving encouragement from people all across South Dakota to run,” Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight.
Since succeeding Kristi Noem a few months ago, Rhoden’s put a contentious pipeline debate partially to rest, sought to smooth out Noem’s contentious relationships with Native American tribes and the media, convinced the Legislature to pass a property tax relief bill and launched an “Open for Opportunity” tour that has him meeting with the state’s business leaders and shaking hands across South Dakota.
“I’m humbled by all the support, but we are not ready to make an announcement until this tour is over,” he said. 
Rhoden, who’s serving out the remainder of Noem’s second term, is off to a “good start” if he hopes to win the Republican Party’s 2026 gubernatorial nomination, according to Mike Card, professor emeritus of political science at the University of South Dakota. 
But Rhoden is not the only hopeful with a tailwind.
New SD Governor Larry Rhoden says immediate focus is getting to work, not his political future

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, long rumored as a candidate for governor, raised more than $1 million in the first quarter of this year. That leaves him with $6.8 million in his various campaign accounts. Rhoden had about $90,000 in his committee account at the end of 2024.
 Johnson has a few other important things going for him, said Pat Powers, who writes the right-leaning South Dakota War College blog.
“You will not outwork Dusty on the campaign trail,” Powers said. “And I’m not kidding when I say that he’s got an unmatched campaign team.”
Powers said Johnson is likely running for governor. Johnson’s office acknowledged his interest.
“He’s committed to his day job representing South Dakota in the U.S. House, but is considering a run for governor,” a Johnson campaign spokesperson said. “He expects to make that decision over the summer or fall.”
The race could include other competition. Powers mentioned Aberdeen businessman and boldly pro-Trump Republican Toby Doeden and Republican state House Speaker Rep. Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids as potential entrants in the 2026 race. Attorney General Marty Jackley is another name in the mix. Jackley ran unsuccessfully against Noem for the Republican nomination for governor in 2018.
Powers said Rhoden’s West River appeal — he’s a boots-and-hat-wearing rancher from Union Center — “makes it tougher for Marty,” who grew up in Sturgis and has farm and ranch land near Vale and Pierre. Without Rhoden, Jackley could’ve staked out a position as the only West River bona fide candidate, Powers said.
Republican Jake Schoenbeck, co-host of the Dakota Town Hall political podcast, said Rhoden’s West River appeal could be enough to box out Jackley.
“I just don’t see a path for Marty when Rhoden is already the governor,” Schoenbeck said.
Jackley told South Dakota Searchlight he is receiving encouragement to run for governor “from people who want a conservative in the race.”
“But right now I’m focused on keeping our streets safe and protecting tax payer dollars,” Jackley said.


Because Rhoden’s actions as the state’s chief executive are covered consistently by the media, Schoenbeck said, Rhoden’s name recognition will only grow from now until the election. That could be the equivalent of millions of dollars in free advertising.
“And people will see him as governor,” Schoenbeck said. “They will be able to picture him in the office, and see him addressing South Dakota issues.”
Both Powers and Schoenbeck said Johnson looms large east of the Missouri River, particularly in the state’s most populous city of Sioux Falls.
Rhoden’s lieutenant governor, Tony Venhuizen, grew up in the small East River town of Armour and lives in Sioux Falls, where he’s well-connected and could help Rhoden raise campaign funds.
Powers said Venhuizen was instrumental in the campaigns and the fundraising for his father-in-law, former Gov. Dennis Daugaard.
“But you know, Dusty also has a long relationship with many of those top donors,” Powers said. 
Daugaard, Johnson’s former boss, endorsed Johnson for governor in Oct. 2024.
“I think he plans to run for governor, and I’m four-square behind him,” Daugaard told South Dakota Searchlight at the time. That was prior to Noem joining the Trump administration and Venhuizen becoming lieutenant governor.
State Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, is a friend of both Johnson and Venhuizen. He also worked on Johnson’s first campaign for a seat on South Dakota’s commission of utility regulators. Mortenson sees Johnson as the candidate best positioned to run for governor.
“It’s not just the millions he raised,” Mortenson said. “It’s the thousands of South Dakotans who gave him the funds and support him strongly. There is a big sense out there that we need to get South Dakota moving again, and no one has a better track record of getting things done than Dusty.”
Johnson’s political brand
In 2022, Johnson bested Taffy Howard, now a state senator from Rapid City, when she challenged him in a primary for U.S. Representative and earned 41% support.
Howard is still no fan of Johnson’s. His politics, she said, will adjust to “whichever way the wind is blowing” so he can stay in office. 
“And right now, that means going along to get along with Trump,” Howard said.
Rep. Johnson answers criticism by pointing to record and private sector experience

Card, the USD political scientist, said Johnson wants to appear further to the right on the political spectrum, to thwart a right-wing primary challenger.
“He has gone MAGA,” Card said, pointing to Johnson’s introduction of legislation authorizing the president to buy back the Panama Canal, shortly after Trump brought up the idea.
Card said Johnson may be coming off as inauthentic not only to Trump supporters, but also to the people who previously understood him to be a bipartisan, moderate Republican. It’s a point Shoenbeck echoed.
“That’s not something I would have expected two years ago – not something I would have expected of him,” Schoenbeck said.
Rhoden does not have the same kind of problems as Johnson regarding perceptions of his political identity, Schoenbeck said. 
Johnson disagrees with Card’s and Schoenbeck’s assessments.
“When you actually look at the legislation that we’ve introduced, and when you look at the legislative successes we’ve had, which, again, by the numbers, are substantial, you see that that is the profile of a serious lawmaker,” Johnson said. 
Johnson ranked 14th most effective among 222 Republican U.S. House members during the 117th Congress, and 58th of 228 during the 118th, according to the Center for Effective Lawmaking, which is a project of the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University. 
The Trump card
Trump’s endorsement, should it come, could determine the outcome of the primary election. The president, who now employs Noem in his cabinet, endorsed Noem after the 2018 primary and ahead of the 2022 primary.
The endorsement is Rhoden’s to lose given he loyally served as Noem’s lieutenant governor, Schoenbeck said.
“Trump supporters listen to Trump. And if Noem goes to Trump and asks him to endorse Rhoden, why wouldn’t he do it?” he said. “And why wouldn’t she do that for Rhoden?”
Johnson is cultivating a relationship with Trump, including with a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in January. But he could have a tougher time winning Trump’s endorsement. He voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. He also voted to create an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in the U.S. Capitol, though he later voted against creating the House select committee that ultimately did the investigation. Johnson voted against ejecting Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney – a Trump target of scorn – from House leadership.
Toby Doeden identifies as a pro-Trump Republican. He formed an exploratory committee to consider a Republican U.S. House primary challenge against Johnson last year, while criticizing Johnson as a “career politician” and a liberal. Doeden later decided against running and instead focused on influencing state politics through his political action committee, Dakota First Action.

Doeden told South Dakota Searchlight he and his family are praying about whether he should enter the governor’s race. He said Rhoden is another establishment candidate not delivering Trump’s agenda. Doeden “cannot imagine a situation where the political donors allow both Dusty and Larry to run.”
“President Trump likes winners and leaders who can deliver, something Rhoden clearly lacks the ability to do,” Doeden said.
That stands in contrast to Rhoden’s record since becoming governor, which includes delivering on numerous Republican priorities. During the 2025 legislative session, Rhoden signed bills holding down property tax increases, allowing concealed pistols in bars and on public college campuses, restricting transgender people’s access to restrooms in schools and state buildings, requiring age verification for adult websites, and mandating appeal processes for obscenity decisions by libraries. He also tightened residency rules for voting and signed a bill banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines. 
The new grassroots
South Dakota Republican Party Chairman Jim Eschenbaum said he was surprised when Rhoden signed the bill banning carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain. Doing so was a top priority for a faction of the party. 
The pipeline ban followed strong grassroots opposition to Summit Carbon Solutions’ $9 billion CO2 transport project.
“I think Governor Rhoden did very well this legislative session,” Eschenbaum said. But he said there is still plenty of time between now and the primary election on June 2, 2026. 
Q&A: South Dakota’s new Republican Party chairman wants to weed out fake Republicans

Eschenbaum told South Dakota Searchlight that many Republicans he speaks with are critical of Johnson. A name they like is state House Speaker Jon Hansen. 
Hansen would sometimes be introduced as “our governor” during rallies in opposition of Summit’s pipeline. He told South Dakota Searchlight that he plans to “make an announcement sometime in the near future.”
“I, together with a lot of great conservatives, have been fighting for an even better South Dakota where you and your family come first – not big money special interests and corporate welfare lobbyists,” Hansen said in a statement.
Amanda Radke is farmer, rancher, and influencer amongst the state party’s grassroots. She hosts The Heart of Rural America podcast and writes The Radke Report blog. Hansen’s efforts to defeat the 2024 abortion-rights ballot measure and ban carbon pipelines from using eminent domain, she said, have made him “a powerhouse and in the trenches of the conservative grassroots movement.”  
“Should he decide to run and enter this arena, he would bring a powerful coalition of everyday South Dakota citizens,” Radke said.
Dan Ahlers is the executive director of the Democratic Party in the state. He said South Dakota can expect a contested primary election for Democrats as well, but did not divulge any names. 
“We have a couple people that are looking at the governor’s race,” Ahlers said. “We could have contested races for all three of those top statewide races.”

Shortly after deadly wildfires ignited in Los Angeles County in January, California lawmakers introduced bills to stiffen penalties for arson and other related crimes. One contentious measure — which had the backing of nearly every environmental organization in California — also sought to hold oil companies accountable for wildfires and climate disasters.
The bill failed to advance last week, but not due to any fierce opposition from oil companies. Rather — in yet another example of how Big Oil wins in a state known for being a “climate leader” — it was Big Labor that had the outsized role in blocking the bill.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, the proposal by Sen. Scott Wiener would have allowed wildfire victims and insurers to sue oil companies for causing climate disasters. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, the San Francisco Democrat argued that destructive wildfires during the winter have become “the new normal in California.”

Wiener: “And right now, who is paying for these climate disasters? … We’re paying for them.” 

The only major political donor supporting the proposal was the California Federation of Teachers, which gave at least $2.5 million to legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
Fossil fuel companies, as well as other business groups, did push against the bill. But the biggest donors in opposition were trade unions, which gave a total of at least $12 million to lawmakers over the last decade.

Chris Hannan, president of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California: “This bill’s terrible, terrible policy. And it puts our jobs in jeopardy and puts our state in jeopardy.” 

Compared to other lobbying organizations, labor unions fare better at passing or spiking legislation that fits their agenda, and roughly a quarter of the Legislature is made up of current or former union members. At the hearing, the judiciary committee, composed mostly of pro-labor Democrats, rejected the measure.

Still waiting for Newsom’s tax returns

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Alexei Koseff:
Another tax season came to a close this week without any sign of the tax returns that Gov. Gavin Newsom once pledged to make public.
It has now been more than three years since Newsom — who said before taking office in 2019 that he would be the first governor to release his tax filings annually — has shared them.
CalMatters reported in November, amid renewed scrutiny of the governor’s finances following his purchase of a $9 million Marin County home, that Newsom last made a tax return available in March 2022. That disclosure came during his re-election campaign, under a state law, signed by Newsom himself, which requires gubernatorial candidates to release their five most recent income tax returns.
With the tax filing deadline arriving on Tuesday for most Californians, CalMatters followed up with Newsom’s team about his pledge. Spokesperson Nathan Click said the governor would eventually allow reporters to review his subsequent tax returns, but did not provide a timeline.



Southern CA Kaiser strike pushes on

In what the National Union of Healthcare Workers considers to be the longest mental health strike in U.S. history, mental health care workers at Southern California Kaiser Permanente are close to entering their sixth month of striking, writes CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
Their demands include cost of living wage increases, restoration of pension benefits and more time between therapy sessions for patient follow-up. In March former Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly and former Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg agreed to mediate, but union negotiators voted shortly after to suspend talks when they argued Kaiser refused to consider the three major contract issues. 
Bargaining talks were scheduled to resume on Tuesday — three days after Kaiser mental health care employees concluded their hunger strike on April 12. For five days, eight workers fasted at a West Hollywood church, slept on air mattresses and subsisted on water and electrolytes. 

Adriana Webb, union member: “Kaiser’s trying to starve us out, that’s clear — so, give them what they want. I feel hungry for equity. I feel hungry for change. How is this any different?”

Kaiser spokesperson Terry Kanakri said the company’s goal is to reach an agreement that makes Kaiser “the best place to give and receive care,” but that the union “has made very little movement on the key bargaining issues,” over the past nine months.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit locomotive engineers have rejected a tentative contract deal in a dispute over wages, setting the stage for a possible strike next month.
Members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen voted overwhelmingly against the offer, with 87% of the 427 engineers who cast votes in opposition. Bargaining teams for the union and management had signed a tentative deal March 6, but it required ratification by union members and approval by NJ Transit’s board.
By nixing the deal, the engineers set the clock ticking for “self-help,” under which they could strike under the rules of the Railway Labor Act or NJ Transit could lock out workers. Self-help could begin on May 15. The monthlong delay is meant to allow time for further negotiations.
James Louis, the union’s vice president, said both sides will return to the bargaining table to try to resolve their differences. Engineers already have authorized the union to call a strike if a voluntary settlement isn’t reached.
“We want to have uninterrupted rail service for all who depend on it, but we also want to reach a fair agreement for engineers,” Louis said in a statement. “If we fail to reach an agreement in the next month, we’re prepared to strike.”
Kris Kolluri, the agency’s president and CEO, said he was disappointed by the vote but still hopes to reach a deal.
“I am committed to returning to the bargaining table immediately and meeting every day, for as long as it takes, to get it done,” Kolluri said in a statement.
News of the union’s rejection of the deal came hours after Gov. Phil Murphy said Amtrak and NJ Transit were making repairs that would avert another summer of service delays and cancelations.
When the two sides reached the tentative deal last month, Kolluri and BLET general chairman Thomas Haas said it reflected “NJ Transit’s commitment to fairness, efficiency, innovation, and long-term financial sustainability.”
Haas said this week that NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers have not had a raise since 2019. Sagging salaries have prompted some engineers to leave NJ Transit for nearby railroads with higher wages, union officials said.
“We earn less than our peers at other commuter railroads that share the same platforms,” Haas said in a statement. “For years, we have faced managers who prioritized spending on pet projects including a half-billion dollars for a corporate headquarters with penthouse views, but those same managers couldn’t find an extra dime for their train crews.”
Staffing shortages during the Christie administration contributed to service delays and cancellations, and union officials warned that could happen again.
“Between retirements and those leaving for greener pastures elsewhere, NJ Transit is facing a repeat of the previous engineer shortage, compounded by an inability to recruit new engineers due to substandard wages,” Haas said.
The last railroad strike against NJ Transit was in 1983, according to the union. The agency narrowly avoided a strike in 2016, when contract negotiations settled mere hours before the strike deadline.
NJ Transit is the nation’s third-largest commuter railroad, with 195,000 passengers on an average weekday, according to the union.

Labor unions, not Big Oil, led the opposition.","In summary
The Senate Judiciary Committee spiked a bill to let wildfire victims sue oil companies over climate change. Labor unions, not Big Oil, led the opposition.


Oil companies had their hackles up this year after Sen. Scott Wiener introduced a controversial bill that would allow victims of wildfires and other climate disasters to sue them for causing climate change. 
Facing potentially billions of dollars in losses, Big Oil had a lot to lose. 
But oil companies took a back seat last week when it came time to persuade environmentally friendly lawmakers to kill the legislation.
Instead, Big Oil’s most influential allies in California’s Democratic-controlled Legislature – the unions that represent oil industry workers – led the opposition. They successfully persuaded a committee made up of pro-labor Democrats to kill the measure, which had support from nearly every California environmental organization.
Despite California’s reputation for taking the lead on climate change, the death of Senate Bill 222 is the latest example of how environmentalists’ most aggressive policies regularly fizzle out when Big Labor works on behalf of Big Oil. 
“That’s how the oil companies breach the machine in Sacramento,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, one of the groups that supported the legislation.
A spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, which typically represents oil company interests in Sacramento, declined to comment on why the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California took the lead in killing the legislation.
Chris Hannan, the trades council’s president, said union members feared SB 222 would have a “chilling effect on our economy, setting gas prices through the roof, with absolutely no environmental benefits.”
“This bill’s terrible, terrible policy,” he said. “And it puts our jobs in jeopardy and puts our state in jeopardy.” 
Big money turns out to oppose climate bill
At last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, argued his proposal was urgent after January’s massive wildfires tore through Los Angeles County, destroying thousands of homes and exacerbating the state’s housing and insurance crises.
“We’re not supposed to have destructive wildfires in the middle of winter,” he told the committee. “And yet that is the new normal in California. And right now, who is paying for these climate disasters? Who’s paying for them? We’re paying for them.” 
Wiener’s measure would have allowed victims to sue oil companies for damages, but they would have to prove in court that climate change was specifically to blame for their losses, which is not easy. While scientists have documented the connection between climate change and fossil fuels, the evidence is less definitive linking fossil fuels to specific extreme weather events such as floods, droughts or wildfires.

Two witnesses Wiener brought to testify in support of SB 222 had lost their homes to wildfires. They argued that it’s time for the fossil fuel companies to pay their fair share. 
“Disasters like this are going to keep happening, but you can make the financial burden less awful for all of us,” Moira Morel, whose home burned in the Eaton Fire, told the committee. 
After they spoke, representatives of more than 20 environmental and consumer attorney groups walked up the microphone urging the committee to pass the measure. 
The California Federation of Teachers, which has given at least $2.5 million to legislators since 2015, was the only major political donor supporting it, according to the Digital Democracy database.
But that paled in comparison to what its opponents have spent on politics: at least $22.7 million to members of the Legislature since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
They included major business groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the Civil Justice Association of California, whose board of directors includes representatives from major corporations including Amazon, Pfizer, Apple and Meta, which didn’t didn’t directly take positions on the bill. Those two advocacy groups alone have given nearly $2 million to legislators since 2015.  
Michael McDonough, a lawyer who spoke on behalf of the business groups, told the committee the bill was likely unconstitutional and “retroactively punishes the legal production of fuel for this state, which has been critical for California’s growth since its founding, and which this Legislature has supported for nearly 150 years.” 
Organizations representing fossil fuel companies that opposed the bill but gave no testimony during last week’s hearing also have donated at least $1.7 million to legislators since 2015.  
Democrats find union argument persuasive
But the Legislature’s biggest donors that opposed SB 222 are the trade unions. The State Building and Construction Trades Council, the California State Association Of Electrical Workers and the California State Pipe Trades Council and their affiliate unions have given at least $12 million since 2015, according to Digital Democracy. 
“SB 222 unfairly targets one industry, while ignoring the broader systematic factors that contribute to climate change,” the trade unions’ lobbyist, Keith Dunn, told the committee.
Dozens of rank-and-file union members – pipefitters, boiler makers, painters, iron workers and others – took the mic after Dunn to urge lawmakers to spike SB 222. Many of them looked fresh off the jobsite, wearing safety glasses and T-shirts emblazoned with their union logos. It was a striking contrast in the Capitol, where business wear tends to be the standard attire. 
The measure needed seven votes to advance out of the Senate Judiciary Committee; it failed with just five votes in favor and eight recorded votes opposed. Yet only one Democrat on the committee actually voted “no.” The rest didn’t vote at all, which counts the same as a no vote. As CalMatters has reported, the widespread practice of dodging tough votes allows legislators to avoid accountability. 
There are few groups more influential in state politics than unions in California, despite only representing one-sixth of the state’s workforce. 
As CalMatters reported, labor groups regularly get their way on bills at higher rates than other prolific lobbying groups, due in part to their massive political donations. Around a quarter of the members of the current Legislature are current or former union members. 
One of them is Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles and a member of the committee who didn’t vote on the measure. The long-time former labor activist told the committee that companies that cause climate change should be held accountable, but not at the expense of workers.
“I don’t want to let anyone off the hook, but I don’t want to let working people be on the hook for everything that happens,” Durazo told the committee.

Her office didn’t respond to an interview request to ask why, if she opposed the measure, she didn’t cast a firm “no” vote. The four other Democrats on the committee who also didn’t vote for SB 222 – Aisha Wahab, Angelique Ashby, Tom Umberg and Jesse Arreguín – declined CalMatters requests to explain in an interview why they didn’t vote.  
Sen. Anna Caballero, who represents Merced, was the one Democrat who voted “no.” Like Durazo, she found the union members’ arguments persuasive. She said the costs of the measure would be too high. She urged the Legislature to focus on promoting climate-friendly technologies such as “hydrogen, carbon capture, biogas, biomass.”
“Those are the kinds of jobs that will create a livable wage and also give us the opportunity to meet our climate goals,” Caballero told the committee. “And I think we’re all interested in the same goal … but we’re not going to get that through this litigation.”
Sen. Henry Stern, a Democrat who lost his home in the 2018 Woolsey Fire, addressed the union workers directly before he voted to support the legislation.He said the bill was about making multinational corporations accountable. He said the oil companies had been threatening “their workers that they’re going to fire them” if the Legislature passed SB 222.
“This is targeting those shareholders and those boardroom folks who are making the big decisions back at some corporate headquarters out in Houston or somewhere else, but not you,” he told the committee.
Wiener said in an interview that he wasn’t surprised the trades unions “are fighting to keep those jobs.”
“But it continues to surprise me that the California Legislature doesn’t pass the oil accountability bills, with only a few exceptions,” he said. “I hope that the Legislature will start taking a much more proactive stance to hold the oil companies accountable for the huge harm that they have done and are doing to California and to the planet.”

HB 437 was sent to the Senate for its consideration.
  Rep. Heather Rhyne (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Heather Rhyne (R-Lincoln) said the bill is needed because the state’s homeless population is under regular threat from dealers seeking to sell them controlled substances.
“By making homeless shelters drug-free zones, we reduce the opportunity for these criminal elements to further victimize the homeless while holding operators of these facilities accountable,” said Rhyne, a bill cosponsor. “Providing a safe and secure environment where treatment is provided and the people can get the help they need to become self-dependent is the focus of the bill.”
Rhyne noted that HB 437 also requires signs designating them as drug-free zones. She said shelters needing anonymity such as those serving victims of domestic violence would be allowed to place signs inside front entrances.
The House approved the legislation over the objection of service providers, 140 of which signed a letter opposing the bill. Rep. Julia Greenfield (D-Mecklenburg) shared part of the letter with colleagues.

“As a nurse who was always working in the trenches, I kind of believe it’s important to listen to those who are working in the trenches and to take into consideration their concerns,” Greenfield said.
She said service providers support the larger intent of HB 437 to keep drug dealers away from facilities serving people experiencing homelessness. They are concerned, however, that the bill would hold service providers criminally responsible for “intentionally allowing” drug dealing to takes place within 100 feet of their property.
Greenfield read this passage from the letter: “This implication that service providers are the enemy in working to keep those we serve safe instead of a partner in an incredibly challenging effort to provide both welcoming and safe space is incredibly hurtful and disappointing. This work carries enough risk without the threat of a felony conviction and jail time, depending on how someone interprets “intentionally allows.”
Service providers are also concerned about the expenses of possibly having to hire armed security and fencing off property to ensure criminal drug activity doesn’t take place.
“If the General Assembly would like to work to protect those we serve, homeless service providers would welcome specialized funding to support the personal and design enhancements to improve safety on our campuses,” the service providers said in the letter to lawmakers.
Rep. Allen Chesser (R-Nash) said service providers’ words “fall flat” because the bill speaks to possession with intent to sell and deliver drugs, not simple possession.
“So, we’re not sending the users, the end users to jail with this, we’re targeting dealers,” Chesser said.
He said the burden will be on law enforcement officials to prove a facility is “intentionally allowing” drug sells to take place.
“There’s going to be footage. There’s going to be investigations,” Chesser said. “This isn’t something that’s going to be fly by night. We’re trying to protect a very vulnerable population.”
Last week, Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, shared concerns about HB 437 during a rally at the legislature to lobby for affordable housing.
“I think this is unconscionable because it places and unfair burden on those facilities to increase security, to figure out what this means, to reestablish relationships that are trustworthy within the community,” Agard said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3501-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 09:08:46.077403

An Inland Empire lawmaker wants to make it easier for Californians with disabilities to deal with police traffic stops, by enabling drivers to present law enforcement with special blue envelopes containing information about their vehicle and disability accommodations.
San Diego introduced a blue envelope program in 2023, and Riverside and San Bernardino rolled theirs out last year. Several East Coast states and Colorado also use blue envelopes. 
State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, a Redlands Republican, introduced a bill in February to expand the program throughout California.
“It provides preparation and awareness on the public safety side of it but also accommodates and eases the fear and the panic that our constituents with disabilities may have,” Ochoa Bogh said. “It deescalates the potential of police stops in our state.”
A traffic stop under the program could go something like this: an officer stops the driver and asks for identification. The driver asks to present a blue envelope, which contains copies of the driver’s license, insurance and registration, and possibly relevant information about the person’s disability.
The blue envelope signals the officer to slow down and be patient, and it makes the driver more comfortable interacting with law enforcement.
But critics have concerns about privacy and say the bill doesn’t include resources needed to make sure the program rolls out effectively.
“It would need to be a quality program, and this bill falls short,” said Beth Burt, executive director of the Autism Society Inland Empire.
Ochoa Bogh’s bill calls for the Department of Motor Vehicles to print and distribute the blue envelopes with safety and communication tips for officers and drivers. They would also provide blank spaces where drivers can write in their needs, accommodations and emergency contact information. 
The DMV would offer the blue envelopes upon request. Ochoa Bogh acknowledged some people don’t want to disclose their disabilities; no one would be required to participate. 
The bill will go to a hearing of the Senate Transportation Committee April 28.
During a traffic stop, some people with disabilities may react in ways that officers could read as signs of guilt or defiance.
For instance, Ochoa Bogh said, people with cerebral palsy may have tremors that could be misconstrued as nervous or guilty behavior. Burt said officers sometimes mistake their shaking symptoms for driving under the influence. 
People with limited verbal abilities “may take time to process the information and articulate an answer” to an officer’s questions, Ochoa Bogh said, while those with physical disabilities may take longer to get out of a vehicle. 
For drivers with autism, a traffic stop can worsen communication difficulties and exaggerate stims, which are reflexive, repetitive movements, and other anxious body language. 
Miscommunication over disabilities has led to tragedy. Last year San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Deputies shot and killed a 15-year-old Apple Valley boy who had autism, after he charged at one of them with a garden tool. News reports at the time said it was unclear if the deputies knew he had autism, but the family filed a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations.
That’s why Burt thinks a statewide blue envelope program should apply to all public safety encounters, including those involving pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders, not just traffic stops. And she said there should be training to make sure everyone is on the same page.
Officers need to learn how to communicate with people with disabilities and how to calm down tense situations, she said. People with disabilities and their families must know how to react safely during a traffic stop. And they need to know what the program does and doesn’t do.
“One of our concerns is that families will think it’s a get-out-of-jail-free program; it’s okay that I run a stoplight or get caught speeding because I have a blue envelope,” she said.
Burt said her organization worked with San Bernardino County law enforcement and the Inland Regional Center to build the county’s program, spending $50,000 to produce merchandise, including envelopes, bracelets, key chains, lanyards, stickers and seat belt covers to help people communicate about their disabilities. They also provided written materials in multiple languages.
Burt said she appreciates Ochoa Bogh’s intentions, but a successful blue envelope program takes more time and resources than her bill would provide.
“When you’ve got a good quality program, we’ve seen what it does for adults with autism and other disabilities,” she said. “They feel safe and heard, versus a free program where you would just put the envelopes out with the DMV.”
Last year Assemblymember Kate Sanchez, a Rancho Santa Margarita Republican, introduced a similar bill to create a statewide blue envelope program, which would have cost an estimated $8.3 million. That bill failed in committee. 
This time Ochoa Bogh is calling for community organizations to help cover the cost of producing and distributing the blue envelopes. She said creating a statewide system would provide consistency for people traveling with disabilities.
“This is a framework that local jurisdictions can work with and modify, so that no one is reinventing the wheel and that there is some commonality between adjacent counties,” she said. “It deescalates, it educates and empowers everybody to have a more amicable interaction.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/050622-TRAFFIC-STOP-AP-CC-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-16 09:08:46.077403

Dual enrollment courses are growing on high school and college campuses but access gaps linger, particularly for students in rural areas of California as well as for Black and Hispanic male students.


Students tap on their keyboards as a professor lectures at the front of the room. It looks like any other college course, except that it’s taking place at a high school. This year, more than 150,000 California teens are earning college credit in dual enrollment courses.
Dual enrollment offers high schoolers the chance to attend community college, typically for free, often without having to leave their campuses. By helping students tackle the college academic experience, the programs increase the likelihood that students attend college after graduating high school. 
About 80% of California’s dual enrolled high school students go on to a community college or university, compared to 66% of California 12th grade students in general, the Public Policy Institute of California found. More than a third of California’s dual enrolled students go on to attend the same community college they attended while in high school after they graduate, according to the Community College Research Center.
Many college and high school administrators have pushed to increase students’ college attainment rates, and the state has invested more than $700 million in dual enrollment, leading to a significant expansion. The number of students in these courses tripled between spring 2015 and spring 2024, according to state data. The Public Policy Institute of California found that about 30% of California’s high school graduating class of 2024 took at least one dual enrollment course. 
The growth of high schoolers is a bright spot in overall student totals at the state’s community colleges, which have struggled to fully rebound after enrollment tanked during the pandemic. However, some community college faculty have pushed back against widespread dual enrollment due to concerns about academic rigor and working conditions for educators.


Furthermore, data shows that some of California’s rural students, as well as males and students of color, don’t enroll in and complete these courses at the same rate as others. Some experts and administrators say they’re not just missing out on a couple of college credits, they’re not getting the same opportunities to envision themselves as future college students.
“When high schoolers complete these courses, they are able to fulfill requirements that help them access associate degrees and bachelor’s degrees,” said Daniel Payares-Montoya, a PPIC research associate. “The students benefit, but so do the community colleges, because it helps them enroll more students.”
Rural schools and colleges face dual enrollment hurdles 
In Siskiyou County, at the northern tip of California, the only community college serves a sprawling region that covers mountains, forests and rural towns. Although the county has a population of just 43,000, it is the fifth largest county in California by area, meaning that often the hardest part of supporting dual enrolled students isn’t the actual teaching — it’s having the right technology and transportation to reach them in the first place.
“The personal interaction is a challenge, because we have high schools that are two hours away,” said Kim Peacemaker, a counselor and dual enrollment coordinator at College of the Siskiyous. The college currently has about 230 dual enrolled high school students and about 2,390 students total, based on state data.
Peacemaker said the college has worked to make dual enrollment accessible by allowing professors to meet virtually with students in their high school classrooms. However, she added that some students don’t have reliable internet access at home for homework or tutoring. In Siskiyou County, 13.7% of households don’t have broadband internet.

California’s rural colleges generally lag behind urban colleges in dual enrollment. Kern Community College District in the southern Central Valley and the Compton Community College District near Los Angeles had the two highest percentages of high school students in 2024, at 41%  and 36%  respectively, based on state data. In comparison, 9.7% of students at College of the Siskiyous are dual enrolled high schoolers, and this drops to about 5% in some other parts of the state.
Sonya Christian, the chancellor of the California Community College system, previously led the Kern Community College District, spearheading its expansion of dual enrollment. Now, dual enrollment in the district is “one of the most successful models in the state,” Christian said in an emailed statement to CalMatters.
“I prioritized dual enrollment because I saw it as a potential pathway to increase college-going rates, accelerate degree completion and provide students — especially those in rural and low-income communities — with early exposure to college-level coursework,” Christian said in the statement.
“Everyone should do dual enrollment. It saved me time, it saved me money and it made me feel more prepared for college.”Manuel milke, san diego state student
For many high school students in the small city of Blythe, which sits along California’s border with Arizona, the only people they know with bachelor’s degrees are their teachers. That’s why Clint Cowden, the vice president of instruction and student services at Palo Verde College, said the exposure to college that dual enrollment provides these students can be transformative.
“It’s really a win-win for the community,” Cowden said.
A recent alumnus of Palo Verde College’s dual enrollment program, Manuel Milke earned his high school diploma and his associate degree simultaneously, while juggling varsity soccer and football. Now Milke, who is 19, is set to graduate in the fall from San Diego State with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology. Milke said he chose to attend San Diego State to stay close to his family in Blythe, and aspires to work as a physical therapist somewhere nearby. 
“Everyone should do dual enrollment,” said Milke. “It saved me time, it saved me money and it made me feel more prepared for college.”
Student gaps remain in dual enrollment
As a Latino male, Milke is in the minority for dual enrollment. Based on state data, Black and Latino students are both underrepresented in dual enrollment courses. In the spring 2024 semester, 41% of dual enrollment students were male, while 56% were female. According to Payares-Montoya, these gaps in access to dual enrollment can make it so Black, Latino and male students are less likely to see higher education as an option, compared to their dual enrolled peers.

For Jesse Medrano, an 18-year-old senior at Daniel Pearl Magnet High School in the Los Angeles Unified School District, dual enrollment has provided “a good outline of what college is like.” His high school first placed him in dual enrollment in ninth grade, and since then he has taken five classes, covering topics including economics and political science.
“I didn’t have the drive to seek these courses out, so the fact that they put me in them set this standard for me, and now I’m meeting it,” said Medrano, who is Latino and plans to study accounting at Cal State Northridge. “I didn’t have the motivation, but now I do, and I’m able to succeed.”
At Compton College more than a third of the current students are still in high school, according to state data. Latino and Black students comprise 75% and 9% of dual enrollees, respectively, which are significantly higher than state averages. Keith Curry, the college’s president, said that when students of color complete dual enrollment courses, this gets them comfortable with college academics and leads to better representation at colleges and universities. 
Some faculty push back against expansion
Some community college faculty have raised concerns about the process by which dual enrollment partnerships are established, the level of readiness of high school students for college courses, and who teaches these classes. In many districts across the state, some dual enrollment courses are not taught by community college faculty, but by existing high school teachers who hold the credentials required to teach at a college level. In the Kern Community College District, about 60% of dual enrollment courses held on high school campuses are taught by high school teachers who meet the college qualifications, according to district spokesperson Norma Rojas. 
“Completion is important, but our primary responsibility is for students to learn something along the way.”tim maxwell, college of san mateo english professor
Tim Maxwell, an English professor at College of San Mateo, is a “conscientious objector” to California’s expansion of dual enrollment. Maxwell said he is concerned about what he sees as a focus to get as many students to graduate and earn college credits as quickly as possible, sacrificing college-level rigor and evaluation. 
“Completion is important, but our primary responsibility is for students to learn something along the way,” said Maxwell, who has taught community college courses for about 30 years.
Maxwell has taught creative writing courses on his college campus with several dual enrolled students, one as young as 15 years old, and he said these students are “phenomenal.” But, he added, there’s a difference between a handful of proactive high schoolers going to a community college campus and a high school classroom that “switches to a college class during fifth period.” He said he is concerned about poor working conditions for professors, primarily adjunct faculty, who have to travel to high schools and teach without the proper background or support.
“We need to resist this, and we need lawmakers who understand something about education and not just spreadsheets,” Maxwell said.
Wendy Brill-Wynkoop, the president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges, said dual enrollment is beneficial for students, but that she has “heard grumblings” about a need for faculty to have a more active role in setting standards and policies for dual enrollment.

While in high school in Blythe, Milke said his dual enrollment courses were generally easier than the courses he takes at San Diego State. But they still challenged him and prepared him for a college-level workload, he said.
Lawmakers work to continue growth
Several state laws have been enacted in the past decade to expand dual enrollment in California. In 2015, Assembly Bill 288 established the College and Career Access Pathways program, allowing community colleges and high schools to enter into dual enrollment partnerships. These institutions bring the courses to students, as opposed to those students having to seek them out. The state streamlined the pathways program with the passage of Assembly Bill 30 in 2019, allowing students to submit fewer forms to enroll. Assembly Bill 731, which is currently in committee, would, among other changes, increase the number of units that students in the program can take.
Based on PPIC research, students in the College and Career Access Pathways program now account for about 37% of dual enrollees. This program has a higher percentage of underrepresented students compared to other dual enrollment programs, in part because it eliminates some of the restrictions that can make it hard for schools to offer broad and barrier-free dual enrollment. 
As dual enrollment continues to expand, it increases costs to California beyond the more than $700 million that the state has already invested. That’s because both community colleges and high school districts are typically both able to receive state funding for dual enrolled students, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
According to the statement from Christian, state leaders are working to increase dual enrollment access by expanding partnerships between high schools and colleges.
“My vision is to make dual enrollment a standard opportunity for all California students, not just an option for a select few, increasing equitable access to higher education and workforce-aligned learning,” Christian said in the statement.
Alana Althaus-Cressman, who runs the dual enrollment program at Golden Eagle Charter School, a K-12 school in Siskiyou County, markets the program to all students, not just those who already have a record of high achievement. She studied dual enrollment access for rural students for her graduate school dissertation at Sacramento State University, and started the early college high school program at Golden Eagle Charter in 2024. Students in the program take dual enrollment courses for part of the school day, and high school courses for the rest.
“We don’t want students to think that they aren’t the type of student for this program. It’s for everybody.”alana althaus-cressman, golden eagle charter school
Althaus-Cressman said that because dual enrollment offers students a glimpse of college, it’s important that the classes aren’t only filled with students who already plan to attend college. Some high schools require minimum grade point averages or have other barriers to entry for dual enrollment, which Althaus-Cressman said can perpetuate inequalities.
The early college high school program enrolls about a third of Golden Eagle Charter’s ninth graders. Althaus-Cressman attributes this level of participation to extensive outreach, which included working with school staff to call the families of every incoming high school student to invite them to a dual enrollment orientation. 
“We don’t want students to think that they aren’t the type of student for this program,” Althaus-Cressman said. “It’s for everybody.”

CHICAGO — After nearly five days of testimony, state Sen. Emil Jones III’s federal corruption trial appeared to be nearing its end Tuesday afternoon — until the senator unexpectedly took the witness stand.

Over the last week, the jury has gotten to know Jones’ voice and mannerisms through several hours of secretly recorded footage taken by corrupt red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-cooperating witness Omar Maani in addition to a covertly taped FBI interview. Jurors have learned about Jones’ affinity for wagyu steak and New Orleans from those recordings, which captured conversations the feds characterize as having crossed the line into bribery. Prosecutors also allege the senator lied to federal agents about it.

Now, jurors would hear from the senator in real time. Taking the stand gave Jones, D-Chicago, a chance to give additional context or explanations for key moments heard on the tapes. But it also opened him up to potentially confrontational cross-examination from government lawyers.

As Jones crossed the wood-paneled courtroom to swear an oath to tell the truth during his testimony, he became the first sitting state official in nearly 20 years to testify on his own behalf in trial. Former state Rep. Patricia Bailey, D-Chicago, did the same before her 2005 conviction on felony perjury and forgery charges stemming from her use of false addresses on election documents, though hers was a bench trial with no jury to perform for.

“Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a state senator like my father,” Jones told the jury, briefly explaining that he decided to run for the Senate after his father, former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr., announced his intention to retire from his near-40-year legislative career.

The senator did not mention the heat he took when he replaced the elder Jones on the November 2008 ballot months after the primary election was over. Former president Jones has been in the courtroom most days of his son’s trial but left the Dirksen Federal Courthouse before his son took the stand Tuesday.

After finishing his associate’s degree, Jones worked for a decade in various jobs within state government, starting with “selling license plates,” he said. By the time he won his father’s Senate seat, Jones had spent nearly two years at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity helping “small and large businesses relocate to Cook County” by taking advantage of state incentives.

In contrast to his father’s reputation, Jones has mostly flown under the radar during his time in the General Assembly. The senator didn’t land on the FBI’s radar until Jones was a decade into his role as a lawmaker — and only because he’d caught the attention of Maani, a co-founder of Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed, who began cooperating as a government witness in January 2018.

Maani had been caught bribing several public officials in connection with his red-light camera business, including Jones’ colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago. As chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, Sandoval was in a position to protect SafeSpeed from legislation the red-light camera industry viewed as potentially harmful.

And in the spring of 2019, Maani flagged a measure that Jones had introduced as one of those potentially harmful bills. Jones’ legislation called for a statewide study of red-light camera systems. The bill echoed similar proposals Jones filed for several years running, which never became law.

On Tuesday, Jones explained on the stand what he’d also said on the tapes secretly recorded by Maani and the FBI agent in 2019: That he’d become skeptical of red-light cameras after seeing the impact of the expensive tickets on his constituents while the companies made “millions and millions of dollars.”

The senator claimed he’d seen reports showing that cameras at certain intersections “could make $50,000 a day from violations.”

But he also testified that there was nuance to his criticism of the industry and came to believe that the city of Chicago’s red-light camera program was more egregious than red-light camera systems in other communities. The original 2007 law that allowed municipalities in Illinois to adopt the technology allowed Chicago to operate by its own rules but put far more state oversight on programs adopted by suburbs.

And as a representative of Illinois’ 14th Senate District, Jones was able to compare the programs between the half of his district that covers Chicago’s South Side and the other half that encompasses five of the city’s southwest suburbs.

Still, Jones’ 2019 legislation called for a study of red-light cameras everywhere in Illinois, and Maani made it his mission to talk Jones into limiting his bill to studying only the city of Chicago. After Maani brought up Jones to Sandoval during a March 2019 dinner, SafeSpeed lobbyists — who happened to be friends of Jones’ — invited the senator to a site visit and informational meeting the following month.

But on secretly recorded video of that meeting, Jones told company officials and the lobbyists that he couldn’t commit to changing his legislation.

Jones’ bill went nowhere during the remainder of the General Assembly’s spring legislative session, but at the FBI’s direction, Maani asked Sandoval to set up a dinner between himself, Sandoval and Jones.

The jury earlier Tuesday heard Jones tell FBI agents that he became wary of his meal companions’ intentions during the June 2019 dinner at a suburban steakhouse as Sandoval told Jones that Maani “wants to be your friend.”

Still, Jones agreed to two more dinners with Maani as the summer wore on. At the July dinner at yet another steakhouse, Maani pushed the senator to come up with a number that Maani could contribute to Jones’ upcoming fundraiser.

Eventually, Jones relented, telling Maani, “If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good.”

“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones continued. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Prosecutors alleged Jones agreed to accept the $5,000 from Maani and the job for his former intern as bribes in exchange for changing his proposed legislation as Maani requested. And although the $5,000 never materialized and Jones never amended his bill, the feds say the agreement is enough to prove Jones’ “corrupt intent.”

The jury spent the morning listening to prosecutors pick apart a roughly 40-minute recording of Jones speaking to FBI agents at his home in September 2019. Special Agent Timothy O’Brien testified he and his partner told the senator they were there to ask him questions for their investigation into Sandoval — but opted to not tell Jones that they were also investigating him.

The feds allege the senator lied to agents during that interview, downplaying both his willingness to accept the $5,000 and to change his legislation. Prosecutors lingered on those parts of the interview while questioning O’Brien Tuesday morning, also pointing out that Jones told the agents he didn’t know how much his former intern, Christopher Katz, was being paid by Maani, even though they’d discussed paying him $15 an hour at a dinner 1 ½ months prior.

But while cross-examining O’Brien, Jones’ attorney Joshua Adams pointed to all the times during the recording when the senator volunteered information even before the agents told him that he’d be subject to federal charges if he hadn’t been telling the truth.

O’Brien testified that when he returned Jones’ cellphone later on Sept. 24, 2019, after it was searched at the FBI’s Chicago offices post-interview, Jones made a passing comment that he was “chewed out by his dad and his attorney for speaking to me.”

Nearly five months later, Jones sat for another interview with federal agents and a prosecutor at the Internal Revenue Services’ downtown Chicago office. The senator changed his story, agreeing with agents’ contentions that he’d made a deal with Maani to amend his legislation in exchange for a campaign contribution and a job for Katz.

Five years later, Jones will return to the witness stand Wednesday morning in a courtroom across the street from those offices and finish testifying in his own defense.

Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, in charge of the operating budget, listens to debate Monday, April 14, 2025, on the operating budget. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the first time in more than 25 years, the Alaska House of Representatives has voted against budget language that seeks to limit Medicaid coverage for abortions.
On Monday, the House failed by a single vote to approve a budget amendment that would forbid the state from spending money on abortions unless they are deemed a “mandatory service” under Medicaid. 
The amendment received 20 votes, all from Republicans; 21 votes were needed to approve the amendment, which has been a feature of the state budget since at least 2001. 
Hours later, the House approved a different amendment that seeks to adopt a similar approach with regard to gender dysphoria and care for transgender Alaskans. 
That amendment passed 21-19 on a strict party-line vote, as both Republican members of the House’s coalition majority joined members of the minority Republican caucus to pass it.
Both actions are not final — they would have to be mirrored by the state Senate — but nonetheless have significant symbolic value.
The Alaska House of Representatives has repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to restrict abortion access since the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the privacy clause of the state constitution protects abortion rights.
Each year, under an amendment to the state budget, state lawmakers have attempted to restrict abortion under Medicaid by limiting coverage to only what’s deemed medically necessary.
Introducing the abortion amendment was Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Kodiak.
“The courts have weighed in on this issue, and it is the value and the principle of Alaskans that we preserve life,” she said. 
“The executive branch has provided support for this, the Legislature has provided support for this. So this is simply restoring the language that we have previously had,” Vance said.
The budget language has had limited practical effect because doctors need only fill out a form to demonstrate that a procedure is medically necessary, and an attempt to define what’s medically necessary was struck down in court. 
The Alaska Supreme Court ruled that using different definitions for abortion and for other cases violated the right to equal protection of the laws under the Alaska Constitution.
Nevertheless, the amendment has turned into an annual statement of intent. In 2019, the state Senate initially failed to adopt the amendment, though the final budget included language from the House. Until this year, the House had never failed to adopt the amendment.
This year’s amendment came down to Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, who initially voted in favor of the amendment but changed her mind before voting closed.
“I’m just trying to do the right thing, and putting it in the budget is the wrong thing,” Stutes said afterward. “Aside from the fact that I believe the state doesn’t belong between a woman and her doctor — and our state constitution protects that — I think the intent language, if it were enforced, it’s unconstitutional. So it’s kind of meaningless to put it in the budget.”
Hours later, Stutes and Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, the majority leader, joined 19 members of the House’s Republican minority to add similar language regarding gender dysphoria to the state budget.
If adopted by the Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, it’s unclear what effect the amendment would have. Although a 2021 lawsuit resulted in a federal ruling that requires Alaska’s Medicaid program to cover gender-affirming care, the Alaska Supreme Court has not considered the issue, and the case law around the topic is not established as well as it is for abortion, experts said.
“We’re grateful that for the first time in recent memory, the House did not insert the harmful and performative amendment aimed at stripping patients with low incomes access to coverage for abortion. Unfortunately, the same body adopted an equally harmful and performative amendment attacking gender affirming health care,” said Rose O’Hara-Jolley, Alaska State Director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “We urge the body not to adopt either amendment in its final version — we’re relying on them to stand with all Alaskans, regardless of their income or gender identity.”

(Photo by Pete Starman/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone.
After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes.
Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — the primary psychoactive component in cannabis — in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back.


SC opinions
More than three-fourths of South Carolinians support marijuana prescribed by a doctor, while 56% support recreational use.
The latter is more lopsided by party: 45% of self-identified Republicans favor legalizing recreational use, compared to 62% of self-identified Democrats, according to an April 2023 Winthrop Poll, the last that asked about marijuana.
That compares to 76% of all adults responding to an April 2015 Winthrop Poll saying marijuana should not be broadly legalized for personal use.
Source: Winthrop Poll


But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
That’s roughly in line with the latest polling in South Carolina, where marijuana remains illegal.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
In South Carolina, efforts to legalize marijuana for patients with chronic illnesses have failed repeatedly for over a decade. The idea has twice passed the state Senate but never received a vote on the House floor, with opponents arguing it would create the framework for a full-scale marijuana industry and wide-open legalization.
Medical marijuana in SC likely dead, again, as House lets clock run out

GOP Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort, who’s led the effort, has refiled legislation to try again. But his bill has yet to even get a hearing this year.
Mallinson acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers.
One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws.
The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
(In South Carolina, that’s already the case. The state constitution doesn’t allow voter-driven ballot initiatives. Only the Legislature can create laws, and it takes a supermajority approval in both chambers to put a question on ballots asking voters whether the constitution should be amended.)
In Idaho, advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel, the House minority leader.
Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
Trump’s support of Florida marijuana legalization may show growing bipartisan consensus

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Sponsor of  HB 480, Rep. Alan Treadaway, R-Morris, said he has heard of people using one of these IDs to vote in Alabama elections. Treadaway did not say where or how many.
“My understanding is there’s been some confusion at the polling places,” he said.
People from foreign countries with legal status in the country may apply for driver’s licenses or IDs from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency but are not authorized to vote.
House Democrats criticized the legislation saying it is unnecessary. Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, prodded Treadaway for proof that this has happened.
“I would like to know where it happens and how frequently it happens before we jump into this,” Moore said.
Rep. Laura Hall, D-Mobile, questioned the need for a law if the ID is not on the list of approved photo-IDs to vote.
“If it’s not one of them, why do we need a bill? It’s already not one of the ones you can use to vote,” Hall said.
Treadaway said the IDs have caused confusion at polling locations and the bill would clarify that one could not be used in order to vote. 
“If they have, or haven’t been used, this bill simply says they cannot be used unless they get their U.S. citizenship,” he said.
The bill passed 76-5, with 21 abstentions. It goes to the Senate.

Bills and resolutions had to pass out of a committee by Friday, which marked day 68 of the 120-day session; 281 did not. The remainder of the bills either did advance or are exempt from the deadlines.
Among the most high profile to die on Friday: a proposal to amend the Nevada Constitution to allow for a state lottery. Assembly Joint Resolution 5 was passed by the 2023 Legislature and needed to be passed by the 2025 Legislature in order to advance to the 2026 General Election ballot for final approval by voters. It was not given a hearing before Friday’s deadline.
The lottery proposal was pushed by Culinary Union, which on Monday issued a statement deriding Democratic leadership for not giving the resolution a hearing this session.
“With federal cuts looming, uncertainty around the state budget, and lack of funding for education and mental health, Nevadans need real solutions and we need it now,” Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. “Politicians cannot complain about budget shortfalls while refusing to even consider a bill that would bring in new revenue.”
A second bill being pushed by Culinary, Senate Bill 360, also died Friday. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo had said he would veto the bill if it made it to his desk, and the bill would have faced significant resistance in the Legislature anyway.
Dubbed the Hotel Safety Act, SB360 was sponsored by state Sen. Lori Rogich, a Republican who Culinary endorsed over a Democratic incumbent in last year’s general election. Culinary had previously endorsed the incumbent, Dallas Harris, but withdrew support for her and other Democrats after they voted against a similar room cleaning proposal in 2023. (Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who sponsored the lottery resolution, was also “unendorsed.”)
Another high-profile bill that died Friday was Senate Bill 415, which would have allowed local jurisdictions to use automated traffic enforcement cameras. The more sweeping of two red light camera bills introduced this session, SB415 was considered problematic by civil rights groups like the ACLU of Nevada.
The second red light camera bill, Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett’s Assembly Bill 402, is still alive. That bill is exempt from standard deadlines but cleared the Assembly Growth and Infrastructure Committee last week. It would authorize traffic monitoring cameras in construction work zones when workers are present.
Opponents of automated red light cameras say they will continue monitoring bills to see if lawmakers attempt to amend parts of SB415 into other bills, including AB402.
“The deployment of red-light cameras is often framed as a matter of public safety, but in reality, most civil liberties abuses happen under the guise of public safety,” said ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah in a statement Monday.
Two bills sponsored on behalf of the Nevada Highway Patrol also failed to advance. Assembly Bill 54 would have subjected a driver to a felony if they failed to move over for an emergency services provider and that resulted in the death of a first responder. The bill received a hearing but was not passed out of committee.
A second Nevada Highway Patrol proposal, Senate Bill 37 would have criminalized road rage. It never received a hearing.
Other bills and resolutions the Nevada Current has covered that are now dead:

Assembly Joint Resolution 6, sponsored by 27 Democrats. The resolution, which passed in 2023 but needed to be passed once more by the Legislature and then by voters, would have had Nevada enter the National Popular Vote Compact, an interstate agreement wherein states commit to allocating their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. AJR6 was not given a hearing by the Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections.
Assembly Bill 33, sponsored by Republican State Controller Andy Matthews. The bill would have established a Nevada Inspector General. Described by some as having “DOGE vibes,” the bill was heard by the Assembly Government Affairs Committee but no action was taken.
 Assembly Bill 141, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Duy Nguyen. The bill would have required judicial candidates to have participated in at least 10 trials. The bill received a poor reception in the Assembly Judiciary Committee during its hearing and no action was taken.
Senate Bill 242, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Edgar Flores. The bill would have prohibited investment companies from purchasing residential properties unless they have been listed on the market for at least 30 days. The bill never received a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but other attempts to rein in corporate ownership of single-family homes did move forward.
Assembly Bill 129, sponsored by Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman, and Senate Bill 221 and Senate Bill 222, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Carrie Ann Buck. This trio of homeowners association bills died without receiving hearings, but at least half a dozen other HOA-focused bills have advanced.

Of course, nothing is ever truly dead in the Legislature. For proof of that, just look to Assembly Bill 381, dubbed Reba’s Law, which mandates prison time for killing a domestic animal. Sponsored by Republican Assemblymember Melissa Hardy, the bill failed to advance out of committee by Friday’s committee deadline only to be posthumously given a waiver and advanced on Monday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20230123_NVSoS_1717-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 08:07:02.026799

It could stop a probe of our governor.,"Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, seen here in 2024 with President Donald Trump, said she's investigating New Jersey's governor and attorney general over their refusal to allow state and local cops to assist with civilian immigration enforcement. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has a big hurdle to climb in her alleged pursuit of an investigation into our governor and attorney general: the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Habba said she’s pursuing a probe of Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which bars law enforcement from becoming de facto immigration agents in the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.
But legal experts told me the Tenth Amendment — which says “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people” — has long been recognized as one that protects states against intrusions by the federal government. Intrusions like, say, conscripting local cops in a federal push to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.
Conservative hero U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a 1997 decision that, under the Tenth Amendment, the federal government “is one of enumerated, hence limited, powers.”
Concerns about protecting the division of authority between an overly powerful federal government, particularly when it comes to criminal justice policy, is a longtime concern of well-regarded jurists appointed by conservative and Republican presidents, according to Jenny-Brooke Condon, who teaches law at Seton Hall University.
“I think Justice O’Connor and Justice Scalia were long critics of an overly powerful federal government and protective of states’ rights and strong advocates for robust Tenth Amendment protections,” Condon said.
This might be an area of the law Habba should study.
I wrote last week about my doubt that there is any such investigation. Habba, a loyalist to President Donald Trump, has learned from her boss that it’s easier to issue a dramatic threat than to follow through on one.
But if Habba proceeds with her probe of Murphy and Platkin, she’ll have to contend with decades of court precedent on the limits of federal power. Steve Wasserman, a retired public defender and an adjunct associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the question of whether states can opt out of assisting with immigration enforcement is a difficult one. But he noted that the 1997 case, called Printz v. United States, could back up Murphy and Platkin here.
In that case, county sheriffs in Montana and Arizona objected to a requirement in the federal gun control measure called the Brady bill that local chief law enforcement officers perform background checks on prospective gun owners. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found that the 10th Amendment bars the federal government from compelling local officials to fulfill federal tasks.
“They said that the Constitution does not require the state officials to allow themselves to be conscripted by the feds in order to enforce the federal law. It’s a principle of autonomy, that state and local officials are not subordinate to the feds,” Wasserman said.
Ron Chen, who teaches law at Rutgers Law School, said he thinks former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, whose office drafted the Immigrant Trust Directive, probably studied the 10th Amendment and relevant case law before issuing the order.
Chen cited the “anti-commandeering doctrine,” which emerged in the Printz case and an earlier one, New York v. United States in 1992. In the New York case, the court ruled 6-3 (with Justice Thomas on the winning side again) that the federal government cannot “‘commandeer’ states into the service of federal regulatory purposes.”
“Presumably Ms. Habba disagrees with that decision, but if so, her efforts might be better directed at asking the courts to reconsider, rather than announcing that she is ‘opening an investigation.’  Indeed, I am not sure there is much to investigate here, since the state’s policy has been a matter of public record for some time,” Chen said.

Earlier this month, the Esmeralda County Board of Commissioners approved a development agreement with Ioneer that […]","Goldfield is the county seat in Esmeralda County. (Photo: Sydney Martinez/Travel Nevada)Esmeralda County has secured an agreement with lithium developer Ioneer that will bring the rural county at least $15 million in funding to mitigate the impacts of a massive planned mine in the least populated county in the state.
Earlier this month, the Esmeralda County Board of Commissioners approved a development agreement with Ioneer that will provide the county with at least $5 million in funding for emergency services and more than $10 million for road improvements and maintenance. 
The seven year development agreement is meant to “reasonably mitigate the land use impacts that the development” of Ioneer’s 7,000 acre Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project “will have on the citizens of Esmeralda County.”
Esmeralda County is the least populated county in Nevada, a fact reflected by the county’s infrastructure and services. The county is built to support the roughly 750 residents who live there, but if the projected 500 construction jobs it will take to build the lithium mine is accurate, that influx alone would nearly double the county’s population within a couple of years.
  Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine is in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County near the state line with California. (BLM map)
Under the agreement, Ioneer will reimburse Esmeralda County for the cost of three sheriff’s deputies and six emergency services staffers, including salary and insurance and retirement and benefit costs. Esmeralda County will also be reimbursed for three converted patrol vehicles, one fire truck, and one ambulance under the agreement.
“Ioneer’s investments will make for a safer and more secure Esmeralda County,” said County Fire Chief Jeffrey Bushnell in a press release Monday. “We’re grateful for their financial support and look forward to our continued partnership for the many years that follow.”
The agreement is in the final stages of approval with the county. A signed copy of the agreement will be posted once finalized, according to county officials. 
“Ioneer has embraced our entire community, welcoming our input. They have left no stone unturned in a quest for a fair and harmonious development agreement,” said Mary Jane Zakas, Esmeralda County Commissioner for District 3 in a statement.
For years, county officials have raised concerns about how the largest development project in the county in the last 22 years would require significant investments from the county to expand law enforcement, emergency services, and waste disposal.  The county will also need to take on higher maintenance expenses for the wear-and-tear on roads carrying heavy machinery, a concern reiterated by county commissioners last year during the project environmental review period. 
Those impacts will now be partially mitigated by the development agreement which is designed to “promote the health, safety and general welfare” of Esmeralda County residents while ensuring the “highest economic benefit and least fiscal cost to its citizens,” according to the agreement.
Dyer, a small town about 13 miles from the proposed lithium mine, would likely face the brunt of the impacts from the project. 
State Highway 264 and other transportation routes through the town of Dryer would be used to transport hazardous materials and hundreds of diesel fuel vehicles a day to and from the mine, according to the environmental review.
Under the development agreement, Ioneer would be required to prepare and deliver an emergency response plan to the county before the company starts transporting or storing hazardous materials on the project site, including truckloads of boric acid needed to mine lithium. 
Ioneer would also be required to pay up to $25,000 annually for emergency response and fire protection training as soon as the company begins delivering equipment for construction of the mine.
The increase of emergency services needed to accommodate mining operations also calls for an emergency facility to house the additional emergency workers the county plans to hire, according to the development agreement. Ioneer will be required to pay up to $900,000 for the construction of an emergency facility near the intersection of State Highway 264 and State Highway 773. 
Water and conservation
Lithium extraction requires massive amounts of water, a tough sell in a state plagued by two decades of drought. Ioneer plans to source water from Esmeralda County’s Fish Lake Valley, where the groundwater supply is already over-appropriated and over-pumped. Over the past 50 years agriculture has reduced groundwater in Fish Lake Valley by up to 200 feet in some areas, drying up residential wells.
The agreement acknowledges the need for groundwater mitigation by establishing a county-administered program to help residents in the region who need domestic water wells drilled deeper or rehabilitated.
However, the program would only be funded if Esmeralda County secures grants to fund the jobs and associated costs that Ioneer would have covered under the agreement. In that scenario, Ioneer would get paid back the costs in annual payments and half that money would be set aside for the well digging program.
County officials have also raised concerns about the costs of expanding waste disposal services to accommodate the boom in workers needed to construct the mine. 
The agreement addressed that concern by noting that Ioneer will reimburse the county for the cost of a garbage truck if the volume of household waste increases to the point where another is needed.
“We are dedicated to being good neighbours, providing the County with the necessary resources to ensure that our funding assists the County and services it provides in preparation for the commencement of project construction,” said Bernard Rowe the Managing Director of Ioneer in a statement Monday.
Federal land managers gave their final approval for the mine in October, after a four year federal permitting and environmental review process. Ioneer also secured a $996 million federal loan in January to fund the mine processing facilities and associated infrastructure. 
However, the project was hit with a financial setback in February when South African mining company Sibanye-Stillwater pulled back plans to invest $490 million in Ioneer for a 50 percent stake in the project following cratering lithium prices.
Despite the setback, Ioneer said Rhyolite Ridge is construction ready and the company is currently focused on seeking a new equity partner to bring the project into production.
Once constructed the massive 7,000 acre project would be in operation for 23 years and remove enough lithium from Nevada’s public lands to supply nearly 370,000 electric vehicles each year. 
The project has also attracted fierce opposition from conservation groups opposed to the mine’s encroachment on critical habitat reserved for the only known population of the endangered wildflower Tiehm’s buckwheat. The flower grows on just 10 acres of lithium-boron rich soil near the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County.
A week after the federal government approved the mine, the Center for Biological Diversity initiated a lawsuit against the mine under the Endangered Species Act.
If constructed, the mine would create a 66 acre quarry — a deep open pit characteristic of mines and where the lithium would be extracted — and directly disturb about 191 acres of critical habitat for the Tiehm’s buckwheat. In total the mine would result in the removal of more than 2,000 acres of nesting sites and foraging habitat for a number of species.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Goldfield-cropped.jpg,,,2025-04-16 10:02:49.064037

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Ellison agrees with his interlocutors that state agencies are discriminating against East African vendors, saying “we are in the middle of the battle with the agencies now.” 
Most distressing is who Ellison is talking to: individuals ensnared in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal that drained at least $250 million from a program intended to help hungry children — but was instead spent on fancy cars, real estate, jewelry and foreign travel. 
The conversation, which was recorded by the Feeding Our Future participants and entered into evidence during a recent trial, took place in December 2021, just a month before the FBI executed a bevy of search warrants. The investigation led to charges against 70 people, with 38 pleading guilty and seven convicted at trial so far. More charges could be coming. 
In the audio, Ellison seems genuinely oblivious to the investigation, as the people — one of them eventually convicted, another awaiting trial —  lobby him to keep the money flowing. The Minnesota Department of Education had halted payments flagged as suspicious, but a judge ordered the agency to resume payments.  
His ignorance about what was happening offers some bizarre comfort — at least he wasn’t aware of the fraud — though it’s also disquieting that he was so uninformed, especially since his office had defended the Department of Education in trying to put a stop to the suspicious spending.  
Ellison isn’t the only elected official who offered his ear to future fraudsters. That’s what’s so striking about the case, though it’s often overlooked: The perpetrators had political ties to influential Democrats. 
Listen to Aimee Bock, the mastermind of the Feeding Our Future fraud who was convicted last month of all seven counts, including wire fraud and federal programs bribery: “Political leaders have been watching the way (the Department of Education) is treating Feeding Our Future and, more importantly, the communities we serve,” Bock said in an interview with the Star Tribune in early 2022. “And they have been intervening and asking the questions that needed to be asked.”
In other words, this convicted fraudster alleges that she used her juice with politicians to get them to lean on bureaucrats who were trying to put a stop to the fraud.   
State Sen. Omar Fateh said in June 2021 — at a party to celebrate Feeding Our Future’s legal victory over the Department of Education — that the pressure tactic was paying off: “What I can tell you is that leadership hears you. Folks at the Capitol hear you. The pressure is really on, and … it’s working.”
With Bock finally convicted, Minnesotans should brush up on how the scandal’s tentacles have touched elected officials. 
Attorney General Keith Ellison
Until last week, there wasn’t much reason to include Ellison on this list of elected officials. His office represented MDE when the agency tried to put the brakes on the millions going out to Feeding Our Future. And once the federal government intervened, the investigation was theirs. 
But the audio reveals something new: Ellison seemed to have no idea about a huge fraud perpetrated on the state of Minnesota and the United States government. Even though his office represented one of the agencies defrauded when Feeding Our Future sued the Department of Education to turn the money spigot back on. 
Moreover, during the 54-minute conversation, he seemed to be commiserating with these strangers about the state agencies he ostensibly represents, and seemed to agree that the agencies were discriminating against immigrant-owned businesses. 
He told them that he had a recent conversation with Jodi Harpstead — at the time the commissioner of the Department of Human Services — telling her to go easier on state contractors: “You’re running small, tiny businesses out of business over nothing.” 
Although we can’t know for sure what was said in that meeting with Harpstead, the commissioner had reason to be focused on program compliance. 
In fact, Ellison’s own office was investigating a boatload of Medicaid fraud in what was known as PIT Stop. The defendants in the case are alleged to have used the identities of hundreds of Somali Minnesotans to fraudulently schedule and bill for provider, interpreter and transportation services that were never provided.
And if Harpstead wasn’t focused on fraud in the state’s rapidly growing autism program, she should have been. When FBI agents served search warrants on two autism centers last year, they alleged “substantial evidence that many of these companies have been submitting fraudulent claims for (autism) services that were not actually provided or that were not covered.”
Why were they investigating autism providers, as the Reformer first reported last year? Because some Feeding Our Future fraudsters were also running autism treatment facilities. 
We’ve listened to the recording, and Ellison’s role isn’t as nefarious as Republicans have insinuated the past week. After all, the fraudsters’ attempt to lobby him wasn’t fruitful. The FBI conducted the raids a month later, and dozens of people have been convicted since. Ellison also received a pile of campaign donations after the meeting; during the meeting, however, he brushes off their talk about campaign funds more than once.  
You can listen to the full recording here. 
Mostly, Ellison just sounds credulous and clueless about what would seem to be an important case for his office. Which is starkly at odds with what he sought to portray when he was running in a tight reelection battle a year later; his office put out a lengthy statement: “For two years, Attorney General Ellison’s office has been holding Feeding Our Future accountable.”
In answers to some questions from the Reformer, Ellison’s office maintains the recorded meeting was an ambush that left him bereft of his usual preparation: “AG Ellison was asked to sit down with a friend that day, Imam Mohamed Omar. When the AG arrived, he was surprised to find others present but agreed to meet with them. It is a shame that these fraudsters tried to exploit the Attorney General’s good faith engagement, but they were not successful. Nothing happened as a result of the meeting.” 
Ellison’s office says after the meeting, he had a conversation with his staff working on the Feeding Our Future case, which got him up to speed, and that was the end of it.  
Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman*
At the June 2021 Feeding Our Future celebration, Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman boasted that he introduced a resolution urging the Minnesota Department of Education to allow minority and low-income communities to participate in the federal meals program. 
“I’m one of those people that push back and call it what it is. Which is racist tactics,” Osman said, smearing MDE employees. The Star Tribune, through a public records request, discovered that the resolution Osman sought to introduce was sent to him by Bock via Abdi Salah, then a policy aide to Mayor Jacob Frey. 
The 6th Ward Democrat’s involvement in Feeding Our Future, it turns out, was extensive. During the same time that Osman was lobbying MDE, Osman’s wife was operating a meal site, which claimed to feed 2,500 children a day and was reimbursed more than $460,000. 
Osman’s wife’s nonprofit was later shut down by none other than Ellison because it was found to have been created for “the purpose of directing funds to herself, her family members, and her co-conspirators.” (She has not been charged for her role in the case.)
Two months after Osman was sworn in after winning a special election in August 2020, he transferred a nonprofit he had incorporated called Stigma-Free International to individuals who then used it to steal millions meant to feed hungry children, according to federal prosecutors. 
We sent him a text and email with some questions, like, why did you transfer control of the nonprofit? And, did you know your wife was running a meal site? And, what have you learned from all this? Osman, who is running for reelection, didn’t respond.
Sen. Omar Fateh
In June 2021, the Minneapolis Democrat, who is now a leading candidate for mayor, was effusive in his praise for the now convicted fraudster Bock. “I want to thank Aimee and her team at Feeding Our Future for making this first court victory a reality,” he said. 
The fraud went on for another eight months or so until the FBI raided a number of businesses and nonprofits that were running phony meal sites. 
During the recent Feeding Our Future trial, a witness testified that Fateh had also reached out to Ellison’s office in an effort to get them to back off. 
Fateh says on the June 2021 video that the problem of the persnickety bureaucrats extends beyond just Feeding Our Future. 
“MDE, DHS whether it’s a Democratic administration or Republican administration. Folks who own group homes and home cares. They see this as an ongoing pattern.” 
Later, Fateh sought to keep up the pressure on the bureaucrats to keep the money train moving.
In December 2021, just weeks before the FBI raid, Fateh spoke at the 1st Annual Somali American Elected Officials Town Hall and alleged that MDE, MDH, and DHS were “consistently targeting” immigrant businesses.
In a statement to the Reformer, Fateh said he heard from constituents about payment delays to government contractors enrolled in the food program. 
“As a senator, I did my due diligence and reached out to the Department of Education; at no time did I advocate on behalf of a specific provider or organization. In my conversations with the administration, I was repeatedly told they did not suspect fraud was occurring,” he said. 
He added: “As we now know, some of the providers were lying to me, and have since been tried and convicted of crimes. I am furious about the theft of public funds, the damage to community, and most of all, the depriving of the children and families who were supposed to receive support during a pandemic.”
Fateh pointed to the 2023 legislative session, when lawmaker created an inspector general at the Department of Education and put accountability measures in place for state grants. He said going forward he’d “make sure funds and programs are reaching the people who need them.”  
Gov. Tim Walz
Walz’s Departments of Education and Human Services sent hundreds of millions of dollars out the door to people who stole it. 
His own Department of Education, represented by Ellison’s office, did try to stop payments to the fraudsters, though it was such a failed effort that the judge in the case found MDE in contempt. 
At various times, Walz has acknowledged the scope of the problem and tried to reassure Minnesotans that he gets it. 
When he proposed a slew of anti-fraud measures in January, he said the theft of public dollars had angered him: “It’s maddening and it makes Minnesotans and myself angry about this.”
At other times, he’s seemed uninformed. 
When a reporter asked him in December about concerns about fraud in the autism program, he seemed caught unawares. 
“We always investigate it and those people go to jail.” Except there’s been no charges yet. 
The number of Minnesota providers who diagnose and treat people with autism spectrum disorder increased 700% in five years, while the amount paid to providers during that time increased 3,000%, from about $6 million to nearly $192 million — according to data provided to the Reformer by the Minnesota Department of Human Services last year. 
Not long after Walz’s confused statement, the FBI executed the search warrants on an autism center in Minneapolis and another in St. Cloud. 
Ellison says during the newly unveiled taped conversation from 2021 that Walz concurred with him about his own agencies. 
“Walz agrees with me that this piddly stupid stuff running small people out of business is terrible,” Ellison tells the group. 
A Walz spokeswoman told the Reformer that since 2021, the “administration has implemented dozens of oversight measures, created a statewide fraud investigation unit, and asked the Legislature to pass his plan to prevent, detect and penalize fraud.” 
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who is running for reelection, had a meeting with the Minnesota Department of Education in 2021 to talk about Feeding Our Future, after the agency had stopped payments to get a handle on the program’s fantastical growth. The point of the meeting was to browbeat MDE Commissioner Heather Mueller and get the agency to resume payments.  
The talking points for the meeting were prepared by none other than Bock. 
Frey told the Star Tribune that he had never met Bock, and that her talking points were delivered to him via his then-policy aide Abdi Salah. 
And who is Salah? He pleaded guilty earlier this year. Frey fired him shortly after the feds seized property he had invested in with his ill-gotten Feeding Our Future gains. 
Frey’s office didn’t respond to a Reformer request for comment. 
Coda
The frauds perpetrated on the state of Minnesota the past few years have been consequential. Money that should have gone to people who needed it wound up enriching people who didn’t. Just as important, these episodes have surely eroded Minnesotans’ trust in government programs, which will make life harder for people who need help.  
Let’s hope the experience has been educational for elected officials, now and in the future.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Eleven mostly rural counties will lose judges under a bill passed 33-16 by the Indiana Senate Tuesday.
House Bill 1144 — which adds judges and magistrates in Elkhart, Hamilton, Lawrence and Vigo counties — has moved through the entire session without language abolishing courts.
Then, on April 10, hours before a committee deadline, an amendment was added in the Senate Appropriations Committee eliminating one court each in Blackford, Carroll, Gibson, Greene, Jennings, Monroe, Newton, Owen, Pulaski, Rush and Scott counties, along with six juvenile magistrate positions in Marion County.
This provision is estimated to save the state approximately $748,885 in Fiscal Year 2027 and up to $2.75 M in Fiscal Year 2032, according to a fiscal analysis.
  Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, speaks on a bill on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, said constituents in her district were shocked by the move.
“That created quite a frenzy from the people that maybe should have been expecting it. I don’t know, but they weren’t expecting it,” she said.
Leising tried unsuccessfully to add her judges back into the bill on Monday. She voted against the proposal.
She said she knows the courts were chosen based on caseload statistics but she wished the list had been made public earlier in the process.
“I would just hope that in the future when things like this are done that maybe it was a more open process so those counties can come speak up,” Leising said. “If a county now has two judges and you do away with one of them, it’s a tremendous impact.”
The general idea of reallocation was discussed in a study committee in October 2024. Essentially, Indiana uses a weighted caseload study that assesses how much judicial time is needed for different types of cases. Then it looks at how many cases are filed to determine how many judges and magistrates are needed for the caseload.
For years lawmakers have added state-funded court officers when the statistics have shown more judges are needed to handle additional cases. But as population has shifted away from some rural counties, they have never taken a judge away — even if the weighted caseload shows they have too many court officers.
Sen. Liz Brown said every two years the study committee looks at the need for court officers when lawmakers are crafting a new state budget. That’s because the state pays for the salaries of judges and magistrates — currently about $183,000 and $146,000, respectively.

“At the same time we looked at where there is not a need in the state,” she said. “I want to assure you that this was not done with any sense of personality … this is strictly where is the need in the state of Indiana.”
Brown said “courts that are losing a judge, we looked at them on their own, independently, and said there is not sufficient need here.”
The weighted caseload study shows, for instance, that Monroe County has ten judges but only needs 7.87. Blackford County has two judges but the study shows it needs less than one.
The bill now goes back to the House, where court abolishments were not originally part of the measure. That chamber can either accept the changes or send the bill to conference committee for final negotiations.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Last week, my best friend, who lives in South Florida, was explaining the hellscape that undocumented immigrants have been forced to endure since Gov. Ron DeSantis – in his slavish devotion to nastiness and cruelty – mimicked the federal government and called a special session in which the Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law that would further punish them.
DeSantis has savaged lawmakers for not doing enough to support President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to detain and deport as many as 20 million undocumented immigrants. He has worked assiduously to engineer Florida’s reactionary version of “how many ways can we screw over immigrants?”
In addition, DeSantis announced in February that the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and the Florida State Guard had entered into agreements to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement round up migrants.
Immigration-rights activists and lawyers report that ICE agents have set up checkpoints, raided people’s homes, and showed up unannounced at construction sites, grocery stores, immigration hearings, and a range of public places where immigrants — with and without papers — hang out.
An assortment of once-safe spaces where men, women, and children congregate are now danger zones. So far, agents haven’t been allowed to invade hospitals or churches.
At any moment, ICE and/or cops deputized by ICE can stop someone under a dubious pretext and demand proof that they are in the state and country legally.
While state and city officials claim that enforcement actions are focused on undocumented immigrants, these actions will have ripple effects across millions more people living in immigrant families, including U.S.-born citizen children, the Kaiser Family Foundation says.
According to its data, as of 2023 47.1 million immigrants lived in the United States, including 22.4 million non-citizens, of whom the Pew Research Center estimates 11 million are undocumented.
There are other immigrants whose lawful status is at risk if they lose temporary protection status (TPS), which many of them are under Trump. That includes almost 1.2 million immigrants who either have or are eligible for TPS, the more than 530,000 active DACA recipients, and people in the country with pending asylum cases.
Millions of others living in immigrant families also are likely to be affected, KFF said.
“Many undocumented immigrants live in families with mixed immigration statuses that may include people with lawful status and U.S. citizens,” researchers said. “As of 2023, 19 million, or one-in-four children in the U.S., had an immigrant parent, including one in ten (12%) who are citizen children with a non-citizen parent.”
Meanwhile, about 4.4 million U.S.-born children live with an undocumented immigrant parent.
 ‘People are afraid’
I talked to Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigration Coalition, a grassroots movement that includes community organizations, farmworkers, youth, advocates, lawyers, and union members.
“We’re seeing or have heard of checkpoints in Gadsden County,” he said. “In South Florida, we’re seeing heavily armed agents carrying semi-automatic weapons, involved in specific pickup/raid operations, mainly at people’s homes.”
Kennedy — who said both he and his parents have been undocumented at some point — reported that immigrant communities are awash with fear.
“People are afraid, worried, preoccupied. But they still have to do the day-to-day. Most people are resilient, trying to navigate the maze,” said Kennedy. “Cops are acting as immigration, asking for papers. Theoretically, they need to have some sort of reason to make a stop. Traffic violations are easy. People can be stopped for loitering or suspicion of some type.
“It wasn’t great before but it’s getting worse.”
Kennedy recounted the case of a University of Florida student here on student visa studying Food Resource Economics who was picked up by ICE because of expired tags.
“Now he’s at Krome,” Kennedy said when we spoke in a week ago. Felipe Zapata-Velásquez has subsequently been deported to Colombia.
None of what we are seeing in the immigration crackdown sphere is new, Kennedy reminds us.
He said a group of activists have met and protested at the ICE/Miramar Processing Center since 2017, where unmarked vehicles leave and come back on Wednesdays full of undocumented men, women, and children.
Advocates are fighting back with lawsuits, protests in Tallahassee and points across Florida, as well as engaging in other forms of civil disobedience and opposition to these tactics, but DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier have threatened lawsuits against those who resist while also threatening to withhold state funds from offending municipalities.
Fort Myers is a case-in-point.
The City Council there voted against but then voted in favor of an ICE agreement (it had failed on a tie vote) — the about-face coming three days after Uthmeier sent a letter warning that DeSantis could remove councilmembers from office unless they approved the agreement, whereby the federal government deputizes Ft. Myers police officers to act as immigration enforcement.
“We were never told this vote could expose us to becoming labeled as a sanctuary city despite the city’s continued lawful cooperation with ICE. That omission is critical to the lack of efficacy that we were displayed,” council member Darla Bonk said during a recent meeting.
Under the 287(g) federal-state task force model, city police officers receive training allowing them to question people about their immigration status and detain them if they are subject to deportation.
 ‘Cruelty’
Floridians for Immigrant Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union assert that “Florida’s anti-immigrant laws that weaponize programs against lawfully present immigrants and their families, separate families, harm DREAMERS, require local resources to be spent on enforcing immigration law, must be ended.
“Cruelty is not an immigration policy. Policies that make Florida a ‘show your papers’ state are un-democratic and do not align with our values.”
Representatives from both organizations note that one out of every five people in Florida was born outside the United States, making the state one of the most diverse in our country.
“It is critical that every single person in our state is able to live, work and travel without fear of violence, harassment and discrimination. As a state with a vibrant and unique immigrant community, we must ensure the movement for immigrant justice is a reality in Florida,” they say.
Further, the activists argue, “local governments should decide how local resources are spent and local law enforcement should spend their time serving local communities — not enforcing federal immigration law.
Policies like SB 168 — approved in 2019 to outlaw “sanctuary cities” in Florida and requiring local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE — and new laws passed this spring requiring cops to perform street-level immigration enforcement — contribute to a climate of fear and demonization of immigrants.
These laws will tear families apart; further weaken trust in law enforcement by encouraging racial and ethnic profiling; endanger communities by discouraging victims and witnesses from reporting crime; and waste taxpayer money by forcing local police to do ICE’s job at taxpayer expense.
A larger question Floridians should be asking is: Who are we as a state? What are our values? What do we stand for? And what do we want as Floridians and Americans?
DeSantis and his culture war crusaders are on the front foot and have capitalized on their recent success with a firehose of legislation, policies, lies, and bullying. But those opposed to his cruel, reckless assault on immigrants have to fight back.
“Now they are empowered,” Kennedy said of DeSantis’ ramped-up anti-immigrant campaign. “It’s extremely concerning with law enforcement’s involvement. It’s costly, a liability, and affects public safety. Most cops don’t want to be ICE, but some will abuse it.”

Mike Kehoe’s longevity raise plan in full and sets up a showdown between two powerful lawmakers over earmarked projects for their districts.
To get the bills to the full Senate, appropriations staff will have to overcome or work around a faulty new software system that crashed Tuesday while the Senate Appropriations Committee took a lunch break. Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said staff would use spreadsheets to track changes that were lost when the $100 million system malfunctioned.
He also cut $13 million from the Office of Administration, which signed off on the software system, to show his anger with the problems.
Despite the difficulties, the committee on Tuesday finished amending nine of the 13 budget bills that pay for the day-to-day operations of state government. When passed in the House, the 13 bills proposed spending just under $48 billion.
For public schools, the Senate plan will include almost $300 million more than recommended by Kehoe in his January budget proposal or the Missouri House was willing to spend. The money will fully fund the state foundation formula by matching the state adequacy target — how much high-performing districts spend per student.
The foundation formula was given $3.7 billion for the current year with an adequacy target of $6,760. The calculation made in 2023 shows it should be $7,145 for the coming year.
“I’ve been very, very on the record in a number of ways, saying that if we’re going to pass legislation, and we know that there’s costs associated with it, we’re going to pay the bill when it comes due,” Hough said.
The budget actions taken Tuesday did not include many offsetting cuts large enough to cover the $300 million item. One possible cut that would provide a portion of the money was not discussed Tuesday.
Kehoe requested — and the House endorsed — $50 million in general revenue to expand a scholarship program for private school students called MoScholars that is supposed to be funded from donations and tax credits. 
The money would be spent in the state Treasurer’s budget, where MoScholars program is housed. That budget will be discussed Wednesday and Hough would not say what he intended to do.
The move to spend more on public schools is sure to win support among Democrats, and many Republicans have said they feel the same as Hough. Kehoe in January said he would establish a bipartisan commission to study the current formula.
State Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis, said she welcomes the additional funding but feels it is not enough. The most recent changes to the formula were designed to reduce its cost.
“We’ve got to figure out for our state, you know, what is the actual cost to educate our students?” May said in an interview after the committee adjourned. “We want a very intelligent Missouri, and we’ve got to figure that out for every school district.”
The committee also included $107 million Kehoe requested in new federal funding for child care to revise how providers are paid. Instead of being paid based on attendance at the end of a month, providers would get their money at the beginning of the month based on the number of children enrolled.
The current system, where payment comes at the end of the month based on days of attendance for each child, has been plagued by missed and delayed reimbursements since a new software program was launched.
Other changes to the budget Wednesday include:

Increasing the base funding for each college and university by 3% rather than the 1.5% recommended by Kehoe and approved in the House. The Senate budget plan cuts $28 million the House approved for one-time maintenance needs.
Restoring Kehoe’s full longevity pay plan of a 1% raise for every two years of state employment, capped at a 10% raise. The House had cut the plan in half, allowing 1% for every two years up to 10 years.
Diverting federal highway aid from the State Road Fund to a new Federal Road Fund. The move would reduce by hundreds of millions of dollars the funds under the direct control of the Highways and Transportation Commission and mirrors a change mandated by legislation that passed the Senate this week.

The committee will finish its work Wednesday, Hough said as the panel adjourned. The remaining spending bills allocate money for the state health, mental health and social services departments as well as the judiciary, elected officials and the General Assembly.
Committee staff will be given a week to produce revised bills that can be debated, with the week starting April 29 set aside for debate by the full Senate, Hough said.
Just before the committee began meeting, the Missouri House gave first-round approval to three additional spending bills for construction and maintenance projects. There were few changes in the bills that spend almost $4 billion and include 45 new earmarked items.
About half of that amount is in a bill using American Rescue Plan Act funds and state revenue for projects approved in previous years. 
All spending bills must be approved by May 9.
Including the three capital appropriation bills, the House added 148 earmarked items costing $289 million, all but $27.5 million coming from general revenue. In the rapid-fire run through budget lines, Hough announced cuts from House earmarks and the addition of Senate items, cutting and spending amounts that could not be tracked as fast as he spoke.
The House Budget Committee releases a list of proposed changes as it begins the amending session. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide a master list for the assembled department officials and staff, lobbyists and reporters who watched the proceedings.
For each item, Hough generally had one of three responses to staff announcing a line — the “House position” or “Governor’s position” or one of those plus new items.
The speed showed Hough had discussed each earmarked item with its backers and made sure no one else objected well ahead of the meeting. There was rarely a murmur about any decision he made.
May, the senior Democrat on the committee, said she was satisfied with the decisions.
“We have got an excellent system, and we move very quickly,” May said.
The challenge over earmarks was set up by House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
During committee work, Deaton moved a large number of Department of Transportation projects approved in previous years to a reappropriation bill. Keeping them in the MoDOT bill added to its apparent size when the items represented the remaining money on unfinished multi-year projects.
But instead of shifting $8 million to rehabilitate a historic footbridge in Springfield to the reappropriation bill, Deaton cut it. In retaliation Tuesday, Hough cut $19 million Deaton added to buy land for a state park in McDonald County where he lives.
First came the footbridge. As appropriation staff announced the cut, Hough’s eyes opened in mock surprise.
“Well, that’s changed,” Hough said. “We’re putting it back in.”
After lunch, the committee worked on the Department of Natural Resources budget, where the park money was added. The park funds were not recommended by Kehoe and a similar item was vetoed last year by then-Gov. Mike Parson.
As the staff reached the line, “governor’s position” was all Hough said.

Cox, a Republican who served as attorney general from 2003 to 2011, posted to social media Tuesday his intention to seek the GOP nomination.
“I’ve protected people my entire life, fought and beat the worst of the worst. Let’s not stand by and let radical politicians or woke bureaucrats undermine us any longer. I’m running to be your Governor, and together, we can Make Michigan Great Again,” said Cox, paraphrasing President Donald Trump’s trademark slogan.
Cox is now the fifth Republican to announce for governor, joining Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space.
On the Democratic side, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson have each announced their campaigns for governor, while Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is running as an independent.
Cox, who is married to former Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox, previously ran for governor in 2010, but came in third in the Republican primary behind Rick Snyder, who went on to serve two-terms as governor, and Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman, who was confirmed last week as the U.S. ambassador to Canada.
Cox, a Marine Corps veteran, later opened his own law firm, best known for representing former University of Michigan student-athletes in litigation against the university for sexual abuse perpetrated by former sports physician Robert Anderson.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — More Oklahomans have been getting vaccinated against measles since cases started to be reported in Oklahoma and neighboring states. 
Between Jan. 1 and April 8, 2024, nearly 24,000 MMR shots were administered according to data provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. In the same time frame for 2025, that number increased by 25% to almost 30,000 shots, according to the Oklahoma State Immunization Information System, a registry of electronic vaccine records. 
The first case of measles in Oklahoma was reported March 11 by OSDH. There are currently 12 cases of measles, 9 confirmed and 3 probable, with exposure sites in Oklahoma City, Claremore, Owasso and Weatherford. All cases are in unvaccinated individuals. 
Nearby, an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico has sickened over 620 people and killed three. Oklahoma’s initial measles cases had reported links to these outbreaks. Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports over 700 measles cases in 25 states. 

Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said in a statement Tuesday that the agency has observed a “concurrent growing rise” in interest in the “MMR vaccine information, administration of MMR, and immunization records at our local county health departments.” But state health officials stopped short of directly linking the increase in vaccinations to the rise in measles cases. 
The Health Department provided Oklahoma Voice with data recorded in OSIIS, which does not include all vaccinations given in the state, only those entered into the system. 
Dr. Mary Clarke, former president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, said all “Medicaid-driven” vaccines are required to be reported and many providers choose to report other vaccines. While some pharmacies and clinics may not report vaccinations, OSIIS is still the most accurate and complete dataset available on vaccinations records in the state, she said. 
Clarke, a family medicine physician in Stillwater, said she and all of her colleagues have experienced more interest than normal in the MMR vaccine, particularly among adults. She said she’s had five to 10 people reach out per week. 
“I would say the vast majority of my pediatric patients are fully vaccinated so I’m personally not seeing a lot of parents calling for their children,” she said. “But I have a lot of adults calling on for themselves, asking about themselves, asking about their grandchildren or great-grandchildren, and how to keep them as safe as possible.”
Receiving the MMR vaccine as an adult is equally as effective as being vaccinated as recommended in early childhood, Clarke said. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12 to 15 months of age and again at four to six years of age, according to the Health Department. 
The recommended age is so young because children are at “very high risk” of contracting measles, Clarke said. 
The MMR vaccine is 97% effective when given two vaccines, she said. Clarke said measles is “extraordinarily” contagious and can be spread airborne.  
“If someone is infected, we don’t go around just giving people antibiotics for measles,” she said. “There really is no good treatment. It’s supportive care only.”

Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, responds to House Bill 1004 criticism on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Senate Republicans and Democrats alike split on a vote for House Bill 1004 Tuesday ahead of a key deadline, torn between whether its language instituted “price caps” or simply brought nonprofit hospital prices inline with state standards. 
Under the proposal, large nonprofit hospitals exceeding a benchmark price for services could be penalized, even potentially losing their state tax-exempt status by 2029. 
Two other health care bills — one in each chamber — passed with near-unanimous support before the third reading deadline on Tuesday. All three bills return to their originating chamber for further consideration.
Under House Bill 1004, Sen. Chris Garten said the Office of Management and Budget will conduct a price study to identify a statewide average that, calculated as a percentage of Medicare, will be incorporated into the final average price for a particular service. 
“It’s not a price cap. You can charge whatever you want, but being a nonprofit in Indiana is a privilege,” said Garten, R-Charlestown. “… if you can’t be competitive with your pricing as a nonprofit with the systems that are for profit, then why should you enjoy the privileges of being a nonprofit in Indiana?”
Garten pointed to increasing hospital prices, though hospitals and employers have frequently sparred over studies analyzing that growth. By using a state agency, Garten said he hoped to create a pricing study that everyone could use. 
OMB will also analyze the potential pitfalls of requiring a higher physician reimbursement of “at least” 168% of the Medicare rate under newly adopted language. 
Additionally, Garten pointed to wins for hospitals, including a reformed Hospital Assessment Fee that leverages larger reimbursements from the federal government — a long-sought win for hospitals — as well as prohibiting insurers from coupling commericial contract negotiations from Medicare Advantage plans.
“I’ve been told by almost every hospital I talk to … that, alone, it would be the biggest thing we could do for rural health care,” Garten said.
A bipartisan coalition of 29 senators moved the bill while another 19 senators, including Republicans and Democrats, opposed the measure.
 Pushback to HB 1004

After a relatively smooth path through the House, the wide-ranging health care bill has encountered more trouble in the Senate, where committee members begrudgingly advanced the bill after one senator called it “the worst bill” she’d ever seen.
Sen. Liz Brown — who twice opposed the bill in two different committees — praised the community support from her local nonprofit hospital, Parkview Health, which would be included as one of the “big five” nonprofit hospital systems targeted under this bill. 
  Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks on a bill on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“This is a Sophie’s Choice,” said Brown, referring to a movie in which a mother faced an impossible decision. “This is a price cap. Now, you can say they don’t have to hit the cap — which is true. They can become for profit. But we all know that our hospitals and their expansions are heavily dependent on the tax-exempt bonds that they use.”
Such bonds were used by Parkview to purchase a struggling hospital in Logansport that was losing $9,000 a day, Brown said, keeping their doors open for crucial health care services.
“Now people in Logansport, on the other side of the state, are going to be able to stay there for their cancer chemotherapy. Why? Because my not-for-profit hospital is reaching out and wants to save the care in that community.”
Sen. Tyler Johnson, an emergency physician with Parkview, criticized the for-profit hospitals in his area for backing away from health care services for underprivileged Hoosiers relying on Medicaid.
“So now all of the prisoners and the overdoses and the gunshot wounds and the psychiatric patients land in my emergency department … because they don’t get to make money off of those people,” said Johnson, R-Leo.

If the criticism was solely linked to high pay for nonprofit hospital CEOs and assets on Wall Street, Johnson asked whether other employers with high-paid leaders and out-of-state investments should also be penalized. Companies affiliated with the Employers’ Forum of Indiana, whose former leader is now the state’s health services secretary, have been some of the most ardent supporters of House Bill 1004. 
“I really don’t understand why (employers) would want to bring a bill that starts price controls … I’ve got a nice pickup truck, but I’d love for it to be cheaper. Let’s put some price controls on that,” Johnson said. “… all we’re going to do is provide chaos to the (health care) system.”
But Sen. Ed Charbonneau defended the move to potentially penalize hospitals in 2029, noting that the deadline was four sessions — and two budget cycles — away.
“I’m not concerned at this point about what will happen in 2029. I am concerned about what happens today,” said the Valparaiso Republican. “If we don’t like what’s happening today, we have to pass House Bill 1004.”
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, the Indiana Hospital Association said its members strove to make health care more affordable “without sacrificing … quality and access.” It praised the inclusion of certain provisions, such as direct contracting with employers and the Hospital Assessment Fee, but expressed a concern about a hard price cap.
“IHA is neutral on the bill in its current form, but as conversations continue in the coming weeks and beyond, we will remain concerned by inflexible solutions that do not take into consideration the uncertainty of rising cost pressures such as inflation, tariffs, and other economic factors that will further threaten the financial stability of Indiana’s health care ecosystem,” said IHA President Scott Tittle. “We look forward to continuing our work with legislators to strike the right balance of lowering costs while maintaining access for Hoosier patients.”
 Other health care measures move

Two other key health care bills met the third reading deadline, but will need to get the stamp of approval from their originating chamber before going to Gov. Mike Braun for his signature.
Amendments to the wide-ranging House Bill 1003 on Monday struck various portions that have been contentious in previous hearings, including site-of-service language and clarifying pricing transparency requirements for diagnostic imaging services.

Staff with the Indiana Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit will also no longer be allowed to act as law enforcement officers — which was a request from the office to expand their investigative powers. 
The bill got the support of nearly every senator, with the exception of Sen. Andy Zay. The Huntington Republican opposed the measure because of the stripped-out portions that regulated pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
“I think it’s time to shine the magnifying glass on areas where we can reform and find savings,” said Zay about PBMs. “I implore those in positions of leadership and authority to take one more look at this.”
Across the Statehouse, the House unanimously approved another PBM measure tackling drug costs and the “unchecked power” of the drug middlemen.
Senate Bill 140 would require PBMs and insurers to have accessible networks and fair reimbursements. Complaints against the two would be filed with the Department of Insurance. 
House sponsor Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, described the proposal as one “to ensure that patients are placed at the center of our health care system.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)At the Art Museum of Eastern Idaho in Idaho Falls, a program called the Teens at The Art Museum is meant to encourage youth to participate in museum activities. 
“​​The demographic that visits museums is aging, and so teenagers and young adults are really the demographic that need to feel like a museum is a vital part of their community,” Amy Thompson, the museum’s development director, told the Idaho Capital Sun.

The program consists of a teen leadership council that plans art-related events throughout the year. Thompson said it gives youth the opportunity to learn marketing, leadership, community outreach and public speaking skills, and it encourages their peers to visit the museum.
The program is funded through a $10,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency that has funded millions of dollars in projects supporting libraries and museums throughout Idaho. Its other contributions include funding a quarter of the Idaho Commission for Libraries’ budget, providing interpretive signs at the Boise Zoo, supporting programs for individuals who are deaf at the Boise Art Museum, and supplying library materials to different Native American tribes across the state.
But funding for programs like hers is in jeopardy.
In late March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce the federal agency to its “statutory functions,” ordering that “non-statutory components and functions shall be eliminated to the maximum extent.” 
Since then, all the institute’s staff has been placed on administrative leave, NPR reported. This has caused delays in processing federal funds that have already been approved, and libraries have no way of contacting the agency. And so far three states, California, Washington and Connecticut, have all had their federal library funding cut. 
As the federal government continues to reduce funding — including this month’s cut to the Idaho Humanities Council — organizations that rely on federal support, like the Idaho Commission for Libraries, are preparing in case they are next.
“I don’t know about how we’re going to fund it next year actually, but we’re hoping that we still can, because it’s kind of gaining momentum,” Thompson said. “It would be really sad to shut it down when we’re just getting speed.”











The Teens at The Art Museum program is so impactful to me because it allowed me to get real world experience while also having fun! Before, I wasn’t too interested in art but now with the experience I have I want to take more art history classes when I go to college. I think working at a museum is a job not many people think about and being able to take a glimpse into that world is so valuable and a very unique experience.

 Idaho Commission for Libraries prepares for potential funding loss

Funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services makes up 26% of the Idaho Commission for Libraries’ funding, or on average $1.6 million each year.
So far, the commission has not had federal funding withheld, but on Friday, the commission held a special meeting to create a contingency plan in case its federal funding becomes unavailable.
The commission requested board approval to allocate $300,000 to cover personnel costs through the end of the fiscal year, which ends on June 30. The board approved the funding. 
Some of the commission’s key programs that are federally funded include: 

The Idaho Talking Book Service, a free audiobook library for Idahoans who are blind, have low vision or experience other qualifying conditions. The $435,200 in annual funding pays for six full-time workers who administer the program.
My First Books/Early Learning, a program that has existed for more than 27 years and provides a book a month for eight months to children who are unlikely to have many books at home. Since the program began, it has served more than 68,000 Idaho youth, and distributed 617,000 books. It costs $114,880 each year.

Other programs include the Library Linking Idaho databases, which provides Idahoans free 24/7 access to online education, business and recreation resources; programs and professional development for Idaho youth; and continuing education opportunities and training for Idaho library staff. 
Processing for 2025 grants has ceased, and 2026 funding applications have paused, according to the Idaho Library Association. 
“The Idaho Library Association implores President Trump to reconsider this adverse action against the Institute of Library Services and the millions of Americans who love and use their libraries,” the statement reads. 
Two lawsuits have been filed to challenge Trump’s executive order. One lawsuit was filed by 21 states’ attorney generals is scheduled to be heard in court on Friday, and a second lawsuit was filed by Democracy Forward on behalf of the American Library Association.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Legislation that would add new restrictions to the process of qualifying for Medicaid is on hold in the Wisconsin Capitol after meeting with resounding opposition at an Assembly hearing less than a week ago.
At a meeting Tuesday to vote on two other bills, State Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) told the Assembly Committee on Public Benefit Reform that he chairs that the Medicaid measure “has some work to be done yet.”
The bill’s author, Rep. William Penterman (R-Columbus), told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message Tuesday that the legislation “is still in the Assembly Committee on Public Benefit Reform. The conversation on how to improve the bill is ongoing.”

An opponent of the measure, however, suggested that opposition testimony had prevailed in keeping it from moving forward.
“I think you all realized how terrible and harmful that legislation was,” said committee member Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), directing his comment at his four Republican colleagues. “We heard two and a half hours of testimony overwhelmingly against that [bill].”
Clancy spoke before voting against two other bills that the committee passed 4-2 along party lines — one making sweeping revisions to Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance (UI) system, and the other barring local governments from instituting guaranteed basic income programs using tax dollars. 
Recipients marshal opposition to Medicaid measure
Medicaid covers acute and long-term medical care for low-income people as well as people with disabilities. It’s funded jointly with federal and state money and managed by the state under federal rules and guidelines.
With some exceptions, recipients must have incomes at or below the federal poverty guideline. Most Medicaid recipients must be reviewed once a year to confirm they are still eligible for the program.
AB 163 would direct the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to conduct eligibility reviews every six months.
It also would add restrictions on the verification process — forbidding the state from automatically renewing Medicaid beneficiaries, forbidding the state from automatically filling in electronic forms with the recipient’s information except for their name and address, and cutting off a person’s ability to enroll in Medicaid for six months for failing to report a change that might make them ineligible.

Penterman, the only witness who testified at the bill’s April 10 public hearing, highlighted the statistic that 20% of Wisconsin residents are on Medicaid. 
He described the legislation as an effort to “reassess and restore integrity to the system by ensuring that only those who are truly needy and truly qualified for this coverage receive benefits.”
But the recurring message from a stream of hearing witnesses — the vast majority of them people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid for long-term health care in their homes or in the community or their family caregivers — was that the current eligibility requirements are already burdensome, and strict enough to keep out people who aren’t eligible.
“We heard from so many people who do a tremendous amount of work to prove to the state that they have low enough income, low enough assets, that they are who they say they are, that they meet the functional screen and all of the other requirements that the department has [for them] to be able to get in or stay in the program,” said Tamara Jackson, legislative policy representative for the Wisconsin Board of People with Developmental Disabilities, in an interview Tuesday.
The hearing came just two days after the bill was introduced April 8. Its fast track prompted an overnight opposition campaign by Medicaid recipients.
“We heard from people across the state who had said that they had contacted their state lawmakers about this particular bill and had really used it as an opportunity to tell them what they do to be allowed in the Medicaid program,” Jackson said.
Federal Medicaid debate draws attention
Recent Congressional action on federal legislation to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 has included spending targets that would appear to make Medicaid reductions inevitable. Medicaid recipients have been following those debates and making public appeals to oppose cuts in the program — priming them to oppose the state proposal as well.
“I think that people are paying attention, and the reason there were so many contacts is because Medicaid is so important to folks and they’re willing to show up and talk about it,” Jackson said.
At the very start of the April 10 hearing, Penterman alluded to communications he had already received from advocates and said he planned an amendment to exempt people with developmental disabilities from some of the bill’s restrictions. He introduced the amendment later that day.
Several witnesses, however, criticized limiting the amendment to people with developmental disabilities, arguing that the bill’s requirements would be needlessly onerous for many other people.
Sandra Lomeli of Pewaukee was one of the hearing witnesses against the Medicaid bill. She is the mother of two adult children with severe disabilities who are able to get long-term care through Medicaid. One requires 24-hour care as a sexual assault survivor, she said.
Lomeli is also covered by BadgerCare Plus, the Wisconsin Medicaid plan for primary and specialty health care and hospitalization, because being her children’s family caregiver limits her working hours to a part-time nonprofit position.
She told the committee that she fills both sides of a ream’s worth of forms each year to confirm her children’s Medicaid eligibility. She said she spends 54 hours completing those forms and 10 hours confirming her own eligibility each year.
In her testimony Lomeli challenged lawmakers to enlist Medicaid participants and advocates if they wanted to write legislation to improve the program.
It appeared to Lomeli that her suggestion “took people by surprise that we would even be at the table,” she said in an interview Tuesday. “I don’t think they valued that we could add value — because if they did, somebody would have reached out.”
She said she doesn’t consider the legislation dead, however, which concerns her.
“The issue is not off the table yet,” Lomeli said. “They’re just going to reword it. We have won the battle now. We haven’t won the war.
UI change, basic-income ban, both pass on party lines
While setting the Medicaid bill aside Tuesday, the Committee on Public Benefit Reform advanced two others with only Republican votes.
AB 164 would rename Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance system as a “re-employment assistance” program with new requirements for workers and for the state agency that administers it.
Those include requiring recipients, who must currently make four work searches a week, to make two of those in the form of direct contacts with prospective employers. It also adds a variety of additional counseling procedures and requirements for people who receive unemployment benefits.
Department of Workforce Development Secretary-designee Amy Pechacek submitted written testimony expressing “concerns about this proposal due to the anticipated reporting burden for employers, potential costs, bureaucratic requirements, and lack of sustainable funding.”
Gov. Tony Evers vetoed similar legislation in 2023, citing similar complaints as well as the fact that it did not go through the state’s joint labor-management unemployment advisory council.
AB 165 would bar local governments from using tax dollars to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. Evers vetoed a similar bill to that one in 2023 as well, on the grounds it usurped local control. 
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) made the same argument against the current legislation.
Knodl defended the both bills as helping to “protect the integrity of these systems, and that’s important if we want them to be sustainable in the future.”
Clancy argued that both should have been put on pause along with the Medicaid bill.
“But all three of those . . . bills are fundamentally the same,” Clancy said. “They are kicking people when they are down. They are hitting people at their most vulnerable, and frankly, in 2025, when national and state Republican policies have meant that people have more needs. We should not be attacking those social safety nets.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House will consider a bill denounced by advocates for transgender Arkansans on Wednesday, the final day of the 2025 legislative session.
Senate Bill 486 would allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the restroom. The bill narrowly passed the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs on Tuesday after 14 people spoke against it and no member of the public spoke for it.
“The intention here is to make it so that trans people cannot exist in public,” said Maricella Garcia, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families’ race equity director. “If you cannot use the restroom, you cannot go out in public.”
Garcia was among several people who said that enforcing SB 486 would require policing and making assumptions about people’s bodies and likely lead to frivolous lawsuits costing taxpayer money.
SB 486 is among many bills related to transgender Arkansans that Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, has sponsored in the past few legislative sessions, including one the Senate passed Tuesday pertaining to gender-affirming healthcare.











It’s not good legislation, it’s not good for our community and it’s not good Christian values.


– Marie Mainard O'Connell, a Presbyterian pastor speaking against SB 486



Bentley sponsored Act 317 of 2023, which prohibits K-12 students from using bathrooms that do not match their gender assigned at birth and requires schools to have a “reasonable accommodation,” such as a single-occupancy bathroom, for those unable or unwilling to do so.
Similarly, SB 486 states that shelters, correctional facilities and other entities must take “reasonable steps” to comply with the policy; Bentley said signage indicating who is allowed and not allowed in a space would be sufficient, and she said SB 486 is meant to be an extension of Act 317.
Bentley also supported Act 619 of 2023, which initially would have criminalized entering and remaining in bathrooms and locker rooms that do not match an adult’s gender assigned at birth if children are present. After hours of public pushback before the House Judiciary Committee, that legislation was amended to limit potential criminal charges and prosecutions to adults present in those spaces with criminal intent.
The conservative Family Council worked with lawmakers from both political parties to formulate the amendment to Act 619 two years ago. On Tuesday, Family Council attorney Stephanie Nichols said SB 486 would close “loopholes” in the law to more closely regulate who can enter gender-specific bathrooms.
Evelyn Rios Stafford, a Washington County justice of the peace and Arkansas’ first openly transgender elected official, spoke against Act 619 two years ago and against SB 486 Tuesday.
“We had a compromise that worked for everybody,” she said. “…Everybody walked away feeling that that was a bill that everybody can live with, and now I feel like that compromise and that promise is being broken.”

 Sexual violence discussion

Nichols and Bentley repeatedly said SB 486 protects women’s and girls’ privacy, the same argument supporters of Act 317 and Act 619 used. Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, was the House sponsor of Act 619 and said Tuesday that not passing SB 486 “opens the door” to men entering women’s bathrooms to commit sexual violence.
Several opponents of SB 486 said not only that transgender women in bathrooms are not a threat, but also that they are often survivors of sexual violence and that the bill does nothing to prevent such things.
“[This bill] exploits my trauma to push a political agenda that’s rooted not in facts but in fear,” Brittany Stockton said. “…The idea that predators are pretending to be trans to attack people in bathrooms is a harmful myth.”
Multiple speakers also said transgender people face a higher risk of identity-based violence and harassment than other demographics. Marie Mainard O’Connell, a Presbyterian pastor and mother of a transgender teen, said she fears one day having to conduct a funeral service for a transgender person dead by suicide or targeted violence.
“If I have to perform that service, you’re getting an invitation,” she told the committee.

Crawford said SB 486 is not intended to harm anyone and her “heart hurts” for transgender people who feel targeted.
“Why should we protect this minority, trans people, when we are putting in danger young women and women in bathrooms that are designated for their sex?” Crawford said.
O’Connell responded to Crawford’s statement by reminding the committee that one of Jesus’ parables in the Bible involves a shepherd leaving 99 sheep behind to search for one that was missing.
“Please vote no on this,” O’Connell said. “It’s not good legislation, it’s not good for our community and it’s not good Christian values.”
Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, said transgender people who no longer physically resemble their gender assigned at birth would be at risk of violence if the law requires them to use the bathroom that does not align with their identity.
Bentley said Clowney was “way out there on a limb” and reiterated the “reasonable steps” portion of SB 486.
“We have two sexes, male and female, no matter how [many] drugs you take or the kind of surgery you have,” Bentley said.
She introduced the bill to the committee Monday, but was asked to pull it down before public comment. House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, asked for an analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact, expressing concerns that public buildings would incur significant costs in order to meet the accommodation standards in SB 486.
The fiscal impact statement from the Department of Finance and Administration asserts that SB 486 will not require the expenditure of state funds or “the construction or modification of any state facilities.”
Rios Stafford disputed this and said not all government buildings in Arkansas have single-occupancy restrooms.
“Any county, any city that wants to do the right thing by their citizens is going to have to spend money and is going to have to spend a lot of money, and we know how much retrofitting a building costs, especially if it’s an older building that was grandfathered in before the Americans with Disabilities Act,” Rios Stafford said.
The Arkansas Senate passed SB 486 along party lines April 2.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Senate action on transgender health care

On Tuesday, the Senate sent a bill to the governor’s desk that would broaden the scope of a 2023 law that created civil liability for doctors who provide gender-affirming health care to transgender minors.
The Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act, or Act 274 of 2023, created a 15-year window for adults to sue physicians for “any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injury” incurred while the adult received hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers or gender-affirming surgeries as a minor.
Bentley sponsored both Act 274 and its proposed amendment, House Bill 1916, which would add mental health care providers to the law’s list of medical professionals liable for “gender-affirming intervention.” She has repeatedly said gender-affirming medical care is harmful to minors; physicians who treat transgender children said otherwise during the 2022 trial over a Bentley-sponsored 2021 law that sought to ban this care.
The Senate Judiciary Committee passed HB 1916 Monday night. Bentley told the committee that gender-affirming care consists of “grotesque experiments that stunt and suppress a child’s natural development in service of scientific fantasies.”
All 29 Republican senators voted to send HB 1916 to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk Tuesday while all six Democrats voted against it.

Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, was the only member of the Judiciary Committee to vote against HB 1916 Monday. He said he agreed with public testimony that the bill’s use of the phrase ​​”gender-affirming intervention” is too broad.
Psychologist Lindsey Thomas said HB 1916 would hold therapists liable for using transgender minors’ preferred names and pronouns as “gender-affirming intervention”; Bentley agreed that the bill would preclude this from happening.
Thomas also said HB 1916 would increase the costs of providers’ medical malpractice insurance and increase wait times for all children to see a therapist in Arkansas.
The bill mentions hormones and puberty blockers, but the six health care professionals that opposed the bill Monday said mental health care providers do not prescribe these medications. Nine more people had signed up to speak against the bill but did not get to speak due to the committee’s time constraints.
“We don’t know if or when an issue of gender dysphoria might show up,” said Garry Teeter, a counselor and a Christian pastor. “We may be working with that child for months or years, and then this comes up in therapy… At that point, it would be detrimental and harmful to the client for the therapist to say, ‘Because of this particular law that’s now being considered, we’re no longer able to provide you the care that we have been providing.’”
In March, members of the House Judiciary Committee, the public and the Arkansas Attorney General’s staff expressed concerns that Bentley’s House Bill 1668 would infringe on the right to freedom of expression. That bill would have created civil liability for any adult who aids a minor’s “social transitioning,” including “changes in clothing, pronouns, hairstyle, and name.”
Bentley promised to amend HB 1668 but withdrew it the day after she filed HB 1916.

Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, addresses the House chamber on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Multiple Republican energy bills dealing with incentives for nuclear power inched closer to the governor’s desk Tuesday following key votes in both the House and Senate.
That included House Bill 1007, a priority measure that would expedite approval processes for large-load customers like data centers and create cost recovery mechanisms for projects utilities take on to serve those big customers. 
It also would require a big prospective grid addition to make “significant and meaningful financial assurances” for such projects — reimbursing at least 80% of costs and protecting other existing and future customers from the expenses.
The bill additionally gets tough with utilities planning to close — or convert to natural gas — any coal-fired plants of at least 125 megawatts. Current law mandates utilities that are not generating at least 85% of peak demand to report three-year projections to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).
The legislation would instead require all utilities to annually report the amount of resource generating capacity they plan to take offline. If, after an investigation, the IURC doesn’t think a utility can provide reliable service, it would have to block the utility’s plan or order it to either acquire or build capacity.
“This bill is about three things: high-wage advanced manufacturing jobs, protecting consumers from rate shifts from large-scale loads, and protecting consumers from rate increases through premature plant closures,” said bill sponsor Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford. “Those are three worthy goals.”

The bill advanced from the Senate in a 36-13 vote, with some bipartisan opposition. All but one Democrat — Sen. David Niezgodski, a co-sponsor — voted against the proposal, along with four Republicans: Sens. Ron Alting, Vaneta Becker, Aaron Freeman and Mike Young.
After strong pushback, senators removed more contentious provisions that intended to boost small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) development — including a 20% sales tax credit for SMR manufacturers.
But Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford, of Indianapolis, said he still had “serious concerns” about pieces left in the bill that could boost “a risky, unproven technology,” referring to SMRs.
“My constituents … they don’t  support this,” he said. “They don’t want to be the test case for nuclear experiments that have failed in other states.”










House Bill 1007 missed the opportunity to put important consumer protections in place.


– Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis


Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, expressed additional concerns “about the message being sent to ratepayers and the entire state.”
“House Bill 1007 missed the opportunity to put important consumer protections in place,” she said. “We know that our utilities already operate as state-sanctioned monopolies, and we have to make sure that we are empowering the IURC, but also empowering ourselves and our ratepayers, to truly, truly get a handle on the increasing rates, and make sure that we’re not politicizing that in any way.”
Shortly after the Senate voted to return the bill to the House for final approval, Robyn Skuya-Boss, director for the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club, reiterated the advocacy group’s concerns over what she called an “Energy Inflation Act.” 
She emphasized that legislative action came just days after Gov. Mike Braun signed coal-related executive orders similar to those endorsed by President Donald Trump. 
“Hoosiers should be alarmed that we’re witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from hard-working families to financially healthy utilities and tech companies in the form of higher utility bills along with increased air and water pollution,” Skuya-Boss said in a statement. “Renewable energy adds a tremendous amount of value to the grid, and it’s disheartening that lawmakers, utilities, and tech companies are actively standing in the way of progress for Indiana’s economy and our environment.”
House moves two Senate bills
Across the hall, lawmakers in the House made progress on two other bills, overcoming hesitation from some members of the supermajority.
The first, Senate Bill 423, forms a small modular nuclear reactor “pilot” program intended to attract interested developers to bring nuclear to Indiana. Bill sponsor Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valpraiso, made clear though that the legislation blocks program participants from charging ratepayers for no-cost contributions by third parties.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

“Already, partnerships are being formed. …. What this bill does is place restrictions on those partnerships that currently do not exist,” he said. “It’s important that we have some control over these partnerships.”
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said he while “appreciate(d)” the bill’s intent to require tech companies to “pick up some of these costs for SMRs, it still has a fatal flaw.”
“At the end of the day, if the project doesn’t pan out, which I think is maybe more likely than not … the ratepayers are going to be on the hook for some of those costs, which is going to be substantial,” Pierce said.
The bill ultimately passed in a mixed 67-29 vote, sending it back to the Senate chamber.
Also returning to the opposing chamber one last time — in a similarly divided 59-38 tally — is Senate Bill 425, which addresses transitions of coal-fired plants to natural gas or SMR sites.
Soliday said the bill seeks to ensure that locals don’t drag out rezoning processes needed for those transitions to move forward. 
Provisions in the legislation set timelines for both utilities and local zoning authorities to prevent yearslong “back and forth delays” that defer decisions.
“In some counties, not all, instead of making a decision, they keep deferring,” Soliday said, pointing to moratoriums, for example, that “keep investors’ money tied up, and they can’t move forward with a project.” 
The bill limits such moratoriums to just one year, then local governments “have to decide.”

“A ‘no’ is OK,” Soliday continued, “but do it in a timely way so the developers can move on.”
Pierce had reservations about this measure, too.
“What this bill is basically saying is if someone comes into your community and they want to put a small modular reactor into a generation facility that exists, your local communities have nothing they can say about that,” he said.
“I think it’s a mistake what we’re doing,” Pierce added. “We’re essentially saying that we value efficiency and speed more than we value public input, because under the current system, you kind of have this back and forth with advisory planning commissions … and that does take some time, but it gives people who are interested in that zoning issue an opportunity to be involved.”
Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, maintained that the bill still allows “an opportunity to go back and forth with the planning commission.” 
“The ultimate decision-makers are the county commissioners, the legislative body,” Culp held. “What a lot of these communities are doing is they’re using this as a stall tactic. … We’re trying to tighten up this loophole a little bit. Local units will still have a whole year to make a decision, and they can still say no, but they can’t delay decisions. … because this drives down development, currently.”

Both measures drew bipartisan support during a hearing Tuesday in the Assembly Way and Means Committee. 
One bill — AB 17 — would provide a tax credit to businesses that make the transition to a model that gives employees a stake. The credit would cover 70% of the costs for converting a business to a worker-owned cooperative or 50% of the costs for converting the business to an employee stock ownership plan. Businesses could receive a maximum of $100,000 from the tax credit. 
In a worker-owned cooperative, employees jointly own the business and have control over its operations. Employee stock ownership plans give employees partial or full ownership of a company’s stock as an investment for their retirement. 
According to the UW Center for Cooperatives, there are 728 cooperatives across the state, including 33 worker-owned cooperatives. 
The bill would create an individual income tax subtraction and a corporate income and franchise tax deduction for  the capital gain realized from the conversion. It would also instruct the Department of Revenue to create a program to promote employee-owned and cooperative business structures, providing education, outreach, technical assistance and training.
“More than ever, Wisconsin benefits from companies keeping jobs here, investing in their communities and staying locally owned,” bill coauthor Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) told lawmakers on the committee. This type of business structure, he said, is a “strong tool” to encourage that goal. 
James said the tax incentive would help businesses considering switching because the conversion process can be complicated and expensive.
According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, a transition to a worker-owned model can initially cost between $10,000 and $30,000. Converting to an employee stock ownership plan can generally cost between $100,000 and $300,000, with ongoing costs of $20,000 to $30,000 a year.
Several Wisconsinites who have benefited from making the switch testified in favor of the bill. 
John Dally, a veterinarian, said it would provide “critical support” for cooperatives in Wisconsin. Dally started a practice about 20 years ago with a colleague in Spring Green, and in 2020, they  acquired another location in Mazomanie. 
As they were getting older, he said, they began considering retirement and the future for their business, Cooperative Veterinary Care.
“We wanted to ensure the practice would stay in these small communities, continue to serve the families and the pets that we just come to know and love — we’ve worked with them for our entire careers — and we also wanted to have some fair and equitable options for our employees and have a return on our investment to sell,” Dally said. 
Dally said historically veterinary practices would be sold to younger associates, but with increasing costs of education, many young veterinarians cannot take on the additional debt that comes with taking it over. Private equity firms and large corporations have also been acquiring small practices in recent years, he said.
According to Brakke Consulting, a veterinary management consulting firm, nearly 25% of general veterinary practices and 75% of specialty practices, such as emergency and surgery care, are owned by large corporations. The issue of consolidation in the pet care field by large corporations has gotten the attention of U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. 
“We were looking around and thinking, what could we do, and I came upon this idea of employee ownership and it just made total sense,” Dally said. He said the transition in 2022 to a worker-owned cooperative cost about $30,000. He said a grant helped with the expense, and they also received support from the UW Center for Cooperatives. 
‘Tangible, positive impact’
Dally said that their team of veterinarians, technicians and assistants have been able to take ownership of the business. The employees, he said, range in age from 20 to 58 and come from a variety of backgrounds. 
“We all came together to create bylaws, manage the business, make decisions about how to allocate resources in smart and equitable ways,” Dally said. He said the cooperative has kept these veterinary services in these communities when they might have closed as they retired or sold to a large corporation who may or may not have kept them there. 
In the three years since transitioning, Dally said the worker cooperative has developed a beneficial health insurance program and a mental health program, invested in new equipment, raised wages and distributed additional profits back to the employees.
“It’s just created a tangible, positive impact on our local communities. It provides a clear pathway for employees to not only work for the business, but to own a piece of it and benefit from its success and all their efforts and enthusiasm,” Dally said. “Our experience in transitioning to this model is proof that it works, particularly in small communities.” 
Dally said it would not have been possible without the help they received, and  the bill could provide the necessary support to other businesses looking to make the transition. 
“It will allow businesses like ours to thrive and continue serving their communities while providing meaningful economic benefits for workers. It has the potential to change the landscape of business ownerships in Wisconsin, especially in these rural communities that are often overlooked by larger corporate interests,” Dally said. “We need your support to make this a reality.” 
Kristin Forde with the UW Center for Cooperatives told lawmakers that the center’s staff has  seen greater interest in employee ownership as a succession strategy for retiring owners, but the models remain largely unknown among business owners. 
Forde said the state is likely to face a crisis in business as Baby Boomers prepare to retire. 
“We really see employee ownership as… a solution to that problem,” Forde said. The legislation, she said, would tie together education and financial incentives to ensure that employee-owned cooperatives are a “feasible solution to retaining jobs and services in our communities.” 
Promoting safe gun storage 
Republicans and Democrats also appeared supportive of AB 10, which would eliminate sales taxes on devices meant to ensure safe storage of guns.
According to the CDC, unintentional injury is a top cause of death among children with guns being a leading method for injury. “It was kind of jarring to hear that,” bill coauthor Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee) said. 
Neylon said unsecured firearms are a major cause for those deaths and injuries, and that  he wanted to propose a way to make safe storage more affordable. 
“This isn’t about politics,” Neylon said. “This is about saving kids’ lives.”
Neylon said after hearing from constituents and consulting with the state Department of Revenue, he has amended the bill to cover a variety of devices in addition to gun safes. 
The amendment defines  a “firearm storage device” as a locked and fully enclosed container and excludes glass-faced display cabinets. It adds “firearm safety” devices, “installed on a firearm designed to prevent unauthorized access to the firearm or to prevent it from being operated without first deactivating the device.” 
Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) said she supports the action, but called for more to be done. 
“Protecting our kids and our communities should be top of mind for many of us… and there are a lot of people that are not responsible gun owners, so I do think we need to do more in this area,” Fitzgerald said. 
Gov. Tony Evers has also included the proposal in his 2025-27 budget, but Republican leaders on the Joint Finance Committee have removed it from his previous budget proposals and have said they plan to write their own budget. Fitzgerald asked Neylon why he proposed the measure if it was included in Evers’ budget. 
“I think, personally, this is at risk of being pulled out of the budget as a public policy item,” Neylon said. While his bill does have a fiscal impact, “I think there’s precedent of doing this through legislation in the past,” he added. “But if it ultimately is in a budget that I support, I would be happy about that.” 
Deductions for teachers’ classroom costs
Lawmakers also considered AB 64, which would allow teachers to claim a tax deduction of up to $300 for expenses, including professional development courses, books and other classroom supplies. It, too, has bipartisan support.
Bill coauthors Sen. Dan Feyen (R-Fond du Lac) and Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake said) the bill mirrors the deduction that is already available for teachers when they file their federal taxes.
“This would double the potential benefit and bring teachers significantly closer to be made whole,” Armstrong said. 
Armstrong noted that teachers “sometimes find it necessary to purchase books or supplies for their classrooms.”  He added that he has  two daughters who are teachers and remind him about the costs “consistently at the beginning of school.”
CESA 6 CEO Ted Neitzke told lawmakers his wife, a Sheboygan middle school language arts teacher, has a classroom with likely “tens of thousands of dollars worth of Mrs. Neitzke’s investments in books and materials.” 
“This is something that… would be a great tool for local school systems, especially when we’re competing nationally for talent, to be able to support our staff in reimbursing some costs that they spend,” Neitzke said. “Any little bit helps.”

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As part of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, seven sites across eastern Idaho will be open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, April 26 for people to drop off medications.
The drug take back day events are hosted by several eastern Idaho law enforcement agencies and health care organizations, Eastern Idaho Public Health announced in a news release last week.
Medications — prescribed, over-the-counter and veterinary drugs — will be accepted. Vaping equipment without batteries will also be accepted, such as vape pens, cartridges and other e-cigarette devices. Needles will not be accepted.
 Why are there drug take back sites?

Unused prescription drugs can be abused, or even hurt wildlife and the environment if flushed away, public health officials say.
Nearly 14% of Idaho high schoolers reported misusing prescription drugs at least once in their life, according to the 2021 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey. 
Almost 74% of Idaho students who reported misusing prescription drugs in the past year say they did it in their homes, the 2021 Idaho Healthy Youth Survey found. 
Around 48% of those students said they misused their own prescription drugs, while almost 21% say they received them from friends or family for free and nearly 19% say they bought them from friends or family, according to that survey, which surveyed kids in sixth, eighth, 10th and 12th grade.
 How to dispose of prescription drugs in eastern Idaho?

Drug take back sites will be open across the eight-county Eastern Idaho Public Health District, including:
Bonneville County: Blue Cross of Idaho Office, at 3630 S. 25th East in Idaho Falls
Jefferson County: Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office at 200 Courthouse Way in Rigby
Madison County: 

Walmart at 1450 North Second East in Rexburg
Madison County DMV at 510 North Second East in Rexburg

Fremont County: St. Anthony City Building at 420 N. Bridge St in St. Anthony 
Teton County: Teton County Sheriff’s Office at 230 N. Main St. in Driggs
Lemhi County: Steele Memorial Medical Center’s special clinic parking lot at 805 Main St. in Salmon
People who want to dispose of prescription drugs outside of the national take back day can find drop-off locations online at the Idaho Office of Drug Policy’s website. 
In eastern Idaho, people can also visit an Eastern Idaho Public Health office to request a free drug deactivation packet.

Republicans have repeatedly criticized Democrats over declining reading scores, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer acknowledged in her 2025 State of the State speech, calling on lawmakers to support the Students, Metrics, And Results with Transparency (SMART) Plan included in her school aid budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2026. 
“Just 24% of fourth graders can read proficiently. The same percentage of eighth graders are proficient in math. I get that this is a national trend, but the reality is that we invest more per-pupil than most states and achieve bottom 10 results,” Whitmer said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Scores are going in the wrong direction, even though schools in Michigan have been receiving record levels of funding, Hall said, telling reporters that lawmakers have to do something differently.
Rather than seeking a plan that would receive full support from Republicans and no support for Democrats, Hall said his caucus looked to changes they could implement immediately that would get bipartisan support. 
“And we’ve been moving on those things. And if that just moves the needle, 20% where, you know, we’re making a 20% improvement to education, well, that adds up over time,” Hall said. 
As the House returns to session this week, Hall said the chamber would vote on a number of policies including a plan to administer the state’s educational assessment test multiple times throughout the school year to help benchmark student’s progress over time. 
They would also be taking up a plan to modernize the state’s merit curriculum system, Hall said, with House Bill 4156 expanding the classes students can take to meet graduation requirements, with the intention of allowing them a pathway that better matches their talents and interests, including options for pursuing vocational training. 
“Things like computer coding could be a foreign language. Computer science could be a science class. Construction math could fulfill the math requirements. Accounting could fulfill the math requirements. Trade schools will count as dual enrollment. So what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to modernize the curriculum to focus on real life skills,” Hall said. 
The House will also be working to support curriculum development through legislation establishing a list of recommended curricula that have been proven to be effective and include strategies for differentiating instruction and ensuring they are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities. 
House Republicans have also put forth legislation ensuring reading and writing instruction for kindergarten through Grade 6 are based on science reading standards, while the content standards for Math from kindergarten through Grade 5 would include updated standards crafted by at least two faculty members from the mathematics departments of two separate public universities in Michigan. They must also include input from at least two elementary school mathematics teachers with an average classroom proficiency level of 70%, with at least 25% of their students meeting the income eligibility standards for federal free and reduced-price lunch programs.



Other pieces of Republicans’ education plan include:

House Bill 4148: which aims to improve representation from rural and northern school districts on the State Board of Education by dividing the state into four districts and requiring political parties nominate candidates from all four districts on a rotating schedule. 
House Joint Resolution E: which would place an amendment to the state constitution on the ballot, allowing the governor to appoint the state superintendent, where the position is currently appointed by the eight members of the State Board of Education.




Hall noted that a number of the policies that already passed received strong bipartisan support, including legislation expanding high school dual enrollment to include trade schools; eliminating fees in applying for or renewing a teacher’s certificate, endorsements or permit and requiring school systems to send an annual notification to students’ guardians that includes data on the school’s performance on state assessments by subject area from the MI School Data website.
As the House moves forward on education, Hall touted the GOP’s road funding plan, noting that it had received support from Democrats like Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel and Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.
While the House Republican plan aims to provide $3.1 billion for road repairs by diverting existing dollars and eliminating spending on corporate subsidies, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proposed a $3 billion plan, which would bring in additional revenue by ending a loophole exempting the marijuana industry from the wholesale tax applied to other products like cigarettes and tobacco, and aiming to bring in an additional $1.6 billion in tax revenue from large corporations and big tech companies. 
Though he disagreed with Whitmer’s plan, Hall questioned where the Democratic-led Michigan Senate’s plan was, calling for the chamber to step up on the discussion. 
“We just need the Senate to come together and actually engage in this process. I think it’s very clear. You see me stepping into this moment. You see Governor Whitmer engaging. I don’t think either one of us are the problem here. There’s one of the three legs here that’s not engaging, and that’s the Senate,” Hall said. 
When asked whether Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) had discussed road funding with Hall, her spokesperson, Rosie Jones, said they’re not going into the details about what had been discussed, but noted the Senate Appropriations committee would be taking up the House’s road funding bills in its meeting on Wednesday.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0567-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 07:05:48.030069

Declining staffing and funding have left North Dakotans in the lurch, dealing with long wait times on the phone and in Social Security offices, busy signals on the phone, or being unable to reach anyone for their customer service needs. SSA scrapped a service change last week that would have forced many North Dakotans to go to a Social Security office in person for routine services currently handled over the phone. This would have been a significant barrier to service in a state where 13,000 people over 65 live 180 miles round-trip from the nearest SSA office. 
No organization has been more outspoken about tackling SSA’s customer service issues than AARP.
While we’re encouraged that SSA is listening to customer service concerns, we won’t take potential improvements for granted. The incoming Social Security administrator needs to focus on delivering effective and efficient customer service to everyone who needs access to Social Security. 

Learn more at aarp.org/socialsecurity.

According to SSA’s own data, call wait times, hold times, and customer service resolutions have been inconsistent for years. Call volume to SSA has increased substantially, and wait times are rising. Fewer people can reach a Social Security representative to meet their needs, and fewer people are getting resolutions to their problems.
It doesn’t help that Congress hasn’t provided the funding necessary to ensure Social Security can deliver quality customer service. Funding to improve the program has long been on the decline. SSA funding has dropped by 9% since 2018.
This challenge emerges just as more people – approximately 10,000 people every day – are retiring. 
Yet, SSA has been unclear and uncommunicative with the public about its customer service issues in 2025. From backtracking on phone service changes to confusion over office closures, SSA’s public controversies have driven anxiety for Americans everywhere. If they don’t commit to customer service improvements, it will cause real hardship for many older Americans trying to get the Social Security they have earned. 
The incoming Social Security commissioner would be well served by re-committing SSA to providing timely, efficient and effective customer service. SSA must be clear when communicating any possible changes and the effects of lower staffing levels. And Congress needs to provide oversight to ensure that customer service is prioritized at an agency that has struggled to serve Americans everywhere.

A new study led by Tulane University backs up that view, revealing stark racial disparities across the U.S. petrochemical workforce. Inequity was especially pronounced in Louisiana, where people of color were underrepresented in both high- and low-paying jobs at chemical plants and refineries.
“It was really surprising how consistently people of color didn’t get their fair share of jobs in the petrochemical industry,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist with the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. “No matter how you slice or dice the data by states, metro areas or parishes, the data’s consistent.”
Toxic air pollution in Louisiana’s petrochemical corridor, an area often referred to as “Cancer Alley,” has risen in recent years. The burdens of pollution have been borne mostly by the state’s Black and poor communities, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Tulane study’s findings match what Cancer Alley residents have suspected for decades, said Joy Banner, co-founder of the Descendants Project, a nonprofit that advocates for Black communities in the parishes between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
“You hear it a lot – that Black people are not getting the jobs,” she said. “But to have the numbers so well documented, and to see just how glaring they are – that was surprising.”
People of color were underrepresented in all of the highest-paying jobs among the 30 states with a large petrochemical industry presence, but Louisiana and Texas had “the most extreme disparities,” according to the study, which was published in the journal Ecological Economics.
While several states had poor representation on the upper pay scale, people of color were typically overrepresented in the lower earnings tiers.
In Texas, nearly 60% of the working-age population is non-white, but people of color hold 39% of higher-paying positions and 57% of lower-paying jobs in the chemical industry.
Louisiana was the only state in which people of color are underrepresented in both pay categories. People who aren’t white make up 41% of the working-age population but occupy just 21% of higher-paying jobs and about 33% of lower-paid jobs.
The study relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Bureau of Labor Statistics and Louisiana Economic Development.
The chemical industry disputed the study’s findings.
“We recognize the importance of examining equity in employment, however, this study offers an incomplete and misleading portrayal of our industry and its contributions,” David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said in a statement.
Cresson pointed to several industry-supported workforce development programs, scholarships and science camps aimed at “closing the training gap in Louisiana.”
But the study indicates education and training levels aren’t at the root of underrepresentation among states or metro areas. Louisiana’s education gap was modest, with college attainment at 30% for white residents and 20% for people of color. In places such as Lake Charles and St. John the Baptist Parish, where petrochemical jobs are common, the gap was minimal — five percentage points or less.
The industry’s investments in education are “just public relations spin,” Banner said.
“The amount of money they’re investing in schools and various programs pales in comparison to how much they’re profiting in our communities,” she said. “We sacrifice so much and get so little in return.”
Louisiana is also getting little from generous tax breaks aimed at boosting employment, the study found.
The state’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program has granted 80% to 100% property tax exemptions to companies that promise to create new jobs. For each job created in Cameron Parish, where large natural gas ports have been built in recent years, companies were exempted from almost $590,000 in local taxes. In St. John, each job equated to about $1 million in uncollected tax revenue.
“This tradeoff of pollution in exchange for jobs was never an equal trade,” said Gianna St. Julien, one of the study’s authors. “But this deal is even worse when the overwhelming majority of these companies’ property taxes are not being poured back into these struggling communities.”

Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, chats with colleagues in the Senate chamber on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tensions flared Tuesday in the Indiana Senate as conversations around an education deregulation bill devolved into a debate over social-emotional learning, or SEL.
In focus was House Bill 1002, a Republican-backed measure that despite its length — 165 pages in the latest draft — would strike multiple sections of current state education code, trimming about 35,000 words in all. 
Examples include the removal of dozens of “may” provisions, eliminating specific COVID-19 pandemic requirements and striking duplicate code. Republican bill author Rep. Bob Behning estimated that the cuts would reduce state education regulations by nearly 10%.










Teachers should be focusing on academic rigor, math, science, reading, writing and technical skills, instead of emotional regulation, empathy.


– Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville


There was bipartisan concern, however, about the bill’s deletion of existing requirements for teachers to complete training in SEL trauma-informed care and cultural competency.
The bill would remove “social, emotional, and behavioral functioning” evaluations from school psychologists’ list of responsibilities. School improvement plans also would no longer be required to incorporate “culturally appropriate strategies for increasing education opportunities” for certain student populations at the school, including different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
SEL, in particular, has been targeted by Republican lawmakers in recent legislative sessions and criticized by conservative groups that say such practices are akin to liberal ideology and should not be permitted in schools.
Some senators push back
GOP supporters said the newest proposed rollbacks are in response to federal guidance. A recent U.S. Department of Education letter, for example, said considerations based on race in educational settings is “unlawful.”
“Teachers should be focusing on academic rigor, math, science, reading, writing and technical skills, instead of emotional regulation, empathy,” said Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville. “Teachers are not therapists, nor should they be treated as such. Trained, licensed mental health professionals are better equipped to handle the social emotional aspects of student life.”


Republican senators who voted against House Bill 1002:

Sen. Ron Alting, of Lafayette 
Sen. Vaneta Becker, of Evansville
Sen. Mike Bohacek, of Michiana Shores
Sen. Sue Glick, of LaGrange
Sen. Jean Leising, of Oldenburg
Sen. Jim Tomes, of Wadesville
Sen. Mike Young, of Indianapolis 
Sen. Andy Zay, of Huntington



But his colleague, Republican Sen. Ron Alting, of Lafayette, disagreed. He emphasized that “the best counseling I’ve had in my whole life was from my teachers and my coaches.”
“If it wasn’t for my coaches and my teachers in my life to keep me straight, to keep me going, I’m not sure where I’d be today. I sure wouldn’t be here, I can tell you that,” he said.
“Those of you saying teachers aren’t qualified … these kids need help … these kids need someone to love them,” Alting continued, becoming more passionate. “I will leave the room if I hear another senator in this place say that a teacher or coach is not qualified to talk to our kids, or that these kids don’t need to be talked to because they do.”
Across the aisle, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, pointed to oppositional testimony provided by teachers.
“They thought that removing this requirement was going to be a bad thing for their classrooms,” he said. “I hear, by and large, from a lot of parents and teachers is that behaviors are the problem in the classroom, and that we need help. … Proponents of the bill say this is something that the parents should be taking care of at home … and that teachers aren’t therapists or social workers.”
“Ask a teacher, if they have a kid in their classroom that is having meltdown after meltdown after meltdown, disrupting the classroom, consistently jeopardizing the education of everybody else in the classroom … I can guarantee you that teacher is going to say, ‘Yes, SEL is probably going to be something that is going to provide some assistance to those students in those classrooms,” Pol noted.
Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford, of Indianapolis, doubled down that SEL “applies skills to manage emotions, build relationships and make responsible decisions.”
“I have seen this first hand with some of the students that I have been in with schools. Instead of a student striking another student, the educators were able to talk with the students and explain that we need to use our words, as opposed to striking another student. That’s social emotional learning,” Ford maintained. “That is a life skill that a student is going to need for the rest of their life.”
More than an hour of debate left Raatz on the defensive.
“I agree … we need counselors in the classrooms and social workers to help with the social-emotional needs of the children. There’s no two ways about it. What I disagree with is that we mandate, from this building, that there’s a certain percentage of your time that you have to counsel,” Raatz said in his final remarks. “The sheer thought that we’re pulling things out that’s going to hurt kids — I take offense. … We’re talking about kids’ lives and interaction between individuals. And the more the state gets involved, the more troubles we have.”
The bill advanced from the Senate chamber in a 31-18 vote. Democrats — along with eight Republicans — opposed the legislation, which now returns to the House for final deliberations.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht)With only days remaining in the 2025 Tennessee session, Shelby County lawmakers filed new legislation Tuesday that critics call a “hostile takeover” of Memphis Shelby County Schools by the state.
The bills sponsored by Rep. Mark White of East Memphis and Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County would create a state-appointed board with authority over the locally-elected school board on budgets, contracts, policy and potentially allow district directors and board members to be replaced. White’s bill isn’t to be taken up until the legislature approves a budget for next year, and Taylor’s version was deferred until April 21, then scheduled for Wednesday.










I’m disappointed in the tactics that have been used to gain control of the schools. This wholesale takeover is not good for business.


– Rep. Joe Towns, D-Memphis


Liz Marable, president of United Education Association of Shelby County, called the bills a “worst-case scenario” because the state could subvert voters’ decisions.
“We have so many positive things going on every day in our school district, and the state has shown that they are not in the business of running schools well,” Marable said, referring to the state’s failed Achievement School District. “I just feel like this is another version of the state trying to take over a local school district.”
Democratic Rep. Joe Towns of Memphis labeled the situation a “hostile takeover.” 
“I’m disappointed in the tactics that have been used to gain control of the schools,” Towns said. “This wholesale takeover is not good for business.”
Towns acknowledged he isn’t satisfied with students’ performance, but he said if the state starts overseeing Memphis schools, it could broaden that to cover every district in Tennessee.  
Tennessee planning $6 million audit of Memphis Shelby schools

Memphis leaders have been fighting the proposal for months, even as White has said action is needed to solve a “decades-old issue of underperformance.” 
In addition to the state “takeover,” lawmakers are putting $6 million in next year’s budget for a forensic audit of the school district.
Both bills create a state-appointed oversight board that would oversee operations of low-performing school systems for at least three to four years. The measures don’t name Memphis Shelby County Schools, but the district is clearly the target, even though the law could be used to go after other school districts.
The state-appointed board would hold authority over district budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and under-used and vacant school properties. 
Besides establishment of an advisory board, the Senate bill allows the state education commissioner to recommend that the district director and board members be replaced. The commissioner also could propose schools be put under a charter group.
Under White’s bill, the governor would appoint four members and the speakers of the House and Senate would select two members each, all of whom must reside in the school district’s county. The Senate version would give state leaders seven appointments and allow the Shelby County mayor or a designee to serve on the board. Under that version, the board would remain in place for at least four years and would end only if the state education commissioner decides the school district has made “sufficient progress.”
Tennessee lawmakers push Memphis-Shelby schools takeover

In addition to veto authority over district budgets, the oversight board would be able to override the regular elected school board’s decision to turn down charter school applications.
Both bills would kick in if 50% of students fail to meet grade-level standards in math and English; 30% of schools receive a “D” or “F” from the state Department of Education; 25% of students are chronically absent, and at least one school school is identified as a “priority” school for poor performance, and the local elected body declares it has no confidence in the school board. 
The Senate version is markedly different, requiring the oversight board to make a comprehensive study of the school district and recommend a “transformation plan,” including goals the district should meet. The review would cover everything from policies and disciplinary incidents to financial statements and accounting principles. The advisory board’s meetings would be closed to the public, except for the meeting in which it adopts final recommendations.
The advisory board would be able to hire up to three staff members for assistance, and they would be paid by the school district, not the state. Under both bills, the board would be paid by the local district.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers began debate on Tuesday over a bill that would set aside $4 million for the office of Gov. Jared Polis to defend the state against actions — including legal proceedings, funding freezes and investigations — from the Trump administration.
“This is a special circumstance where this state needs flexibility to do everything we can and be able to fight, to defend our state and to draw down federal tax dollars that our good citizens have paid into the coffers of Washington, D.C,. and pull those funds back into Colorado,” said bill sponsor Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat.

The money would be appropriated from the state’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act cash fund, which was created in 2022 to bank state money to match federal dollars available through that Biden-era law, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The governor’s office would also be able to accept grants and donations for the legal fund.
The chamber gave preliminary approval to House Bill 25-1321, which needs to pass on a final recorded vote before heading to the Senate.
Specifically, the money could be used to pay for staff and contractors to defend against threats to obligated federal funding owed to the state, or reimburse the Colorado attorney general’s office for the work. The money could also be used to defend state employees in criminal proceedings if that need arises.
The bill comes after President Donald Trump issued a sweeping federal funding freeze in January in order to evaluate if the spending aligned with White House policy goals, which sowed confusion in how the state could pay for programs like Medicaid, early childhood education and grant-reliant services absent federal dollars.
A federal court later blocked the freeze and that decision was upheld by an appeals court, but the administration is still undertaking a broad effort to slash government spending and grant funding, especially for institutions that don’t bow to administration demands.
About one-third of the state’s annual budget comes from federal funding, and there is uncertainty about future cuts or other adverse actions by the federal government.
“We know there are going to be unlawful attempts to withhold money from our state. The only way we can defend against those unlawful attempts is to go to court. That costs money,” Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, said.
Attorney General Phil Weiser signed on to the lawsuit challenging the federal funding freeze. He also joined a lawsuit earlier this month challenging the cancellation of about $230 million in public health cuts to the state.
“We are in uncharted territory, where federal funding has been frozen, and we have examples of that with Medicaid, (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and numerous independent grants. We need to have the flexibility to respond to protect the state’s interests. It is very concerning and should be to all of us,” McCluskie said.
House Republicans have repeatedly offered amendments on bills this session to invalidate a policy if it results in loss of federal funding. All of those amendments have been defeated.
“This is our own doing that we’re losing federal funding because of the bills that we’re passing here. We have tried to run amendments on these bills that say if they impact our federal funding, it will be null. This body has voted those down,” said Rep. Carlos Barron, a Fort Lupton Republican.
The state has not lost federal funding as a direct result of any bill this year, but Republicans argue that some bills involving firearm restrictions, immigration and gender affirming care protections could jeopardize that.

Reporting Highlights

Broken Promises: A Trump administration freeze of funds designated to help new refugees is causing chaos for families and forcing nonprofits to cut promised services.
Frustrated Families: Immigrants receiving less help from caseworkers are struggling to find work and navigate health care systems.
Overwhelmed Volunteers: Church members and other volunteers are filling some gaps, but they don’t have the same resources as the aid agencies that used to do this work.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. Were they helpful?



When Max Rykov started reading a Jan. 24 letter sent to the leaders of the country’s 10 refugee resettlement agencies, he found the wording vague but ominous. The agencies were ordered to “stop all work” funded by the Department of State and “not incur any new costs.”
At first, he wondered if the order from the Trump administration was only targeting refugee work in other countries. Rykov, then the director of development and communications at a refugee resettlement partner in Nashville, began texting colleagues at other agencies. “What does it mean?” he asked.
By Monday, three days after the memo, it became clear. The Nashville International Center for Empowerment, along with similar nonprofits across the country, would not have access to the money the government had promised to refugees for their first three months in the United States. That day, NICE laid off 12 of its 56 resettlement staff members and scrambled to free up funds to pay for the basic needs of nearly 170 people dependent on the frozen grants.
Rykov knew exactly what was at stake, and that delivered an additional dose of dread. Born in the former USSR, he and his family arrived in the U.S. as refugees in 1993, fleeing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic devastation and discrimination against Soviet Jews. He was 4 years old, and it was bewildering. Though his family was part of one of the largest waves of refugee resettlement in U.S. history, they ended up in a place with few Russian immigrants.
  Max Rykov arrived in the U.S. as a child and went on to become the director of development and communications at the Nashville International Center for Empowerment, which helps refugees resettle. Credit: Arielle Weenonia Gray for ProPublica.
Life in Birmingham, Alabama, a post-industrial city shaped by the Civil Rights movement and white flight, revolved around Saturday college football games and Sunday church. Rykov said his family felt “barren” in the U.S. away from their culture. Birmingham’s Jewish community was small and the Russian population tiny.
But a local Jewish organization sponsored the Rykovs and paired them with a “friendship family.” The group rented them an apartment and furnished it. Then the organization helped Rykov’s parents find work. And Birmingham’s Jewish community banded together to fund scholarships for Rykov and other Soviet refugee children to attend a private Jewish school, where Rykov felt less isolated.
He went on to attend the University of Alabama and overcame his feeling of otherness. After graduation, he found purpose in bringing people together through his work organizing cultural events, including arts festivals and an adult spelling bee, doing social media outreach for the Birmingham mayor and, in 2021, finding a dream job at a Nashville nonprofit devoted to the very efforts that he believes helped define him.
When Rykov heard that President Donald Trump’s second administration had ordered cuts to the refugee program, his thoughts raced to the Venezuelan refugee family his organization was assisting, an older woman in poor health, her daughter who cared for her and the daughter’s two children, one not yet kindergarten age. None of them spoke English, and there was no plan for how they would cover the rent, which was due in four days.
“This is a promise that we made to these people that we have reneged on,” he said. “Is that really what’s happening? Yeah, that’s exactly what’s happening.”
As the realization of what lay ahead set in, Rykov started to cry.
Over the next two months, the Trump administration carried out and defended its destabilizing cuts to the refugee program. The moves brought wave after wave of uncertainty and chaos to the lives of refugees and those who work to help resettle them.
One of the largest nonprofit agencies that carry out this work, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, laid off a third of its staff in February and said Monday that it would end all of its refugee efforts with the federal government. A Jewish resettlement organization, HIAS, cut 40% of its staff. As the groups fight legal battles to recoup the millions of dollars the government owes them, some have been forced to close resettlement offices entirely.
The Nashville International Center for Empowerment is still struggling to keep its own afloat. Although NICE staff members had anticipated some cuts to refugee programs under Trump, they said they were caught off guard when reimbursements for money already spent failed to appear and by the dwindling opportunities to seek recourse.
After a judge ordered the Trump administration to restart refugee admissions, the administration responded by canceling contracts with existing resettlement agencies and announcing plans to find new partners. And the administration has indicated it will remain resistant, refusing to spend millions appropriated by Congress for refugees.
“Many have lost faith and trust in the American system because of this,” said Wooksoo Kim, director of the Immigrant and Refugee Research Institute at the University of Buffalo. “For many refugees, it may start to feel like it’s no different from where they came from.”
In court documents, lawyers for the Department of Justice argued the U.S. does not have the capacity to support large numbers of refugees.
“The President lawfully exercised his authority to suspend the admission of refugees pending a determination that ‘further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States,’” the motion said.
In Nashville, that anxiety has been playing out week after week in tear-filled offices and in apartment complexes teeming with families who fled war and oppression.
Rykov couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the extreme shift in attitudes about immigrants in just a few years. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, his family’s dormant fears about Russia were reawakened — but they felt a surge of pride for the U.S. when it stepped up to help Ukraine and welcome its refugees.
Months after the invasion, Ukrainian athletes came to Birmingham for the World Games, which is similar to the Olympics. When they entered the stadium waving the Ukrainian flag, the crowd gave them a standing ovation. His parents, who’d never felt quite at home in the U.S., loudly joined in the “U-S-A” chant that followed.
But now, three years later, was all of America now ready to abandon refugees? Rykov was starting to see the signs, but he refused to believe it and instead recommitted himself to the work.
He and his colleagues reached out to every donor in their network and called an online meeting with local churches who might be able to help with rent payments, food, job searches and transportation.
Agencies would struggle without the help of the churches. And churches don’t have the resources, training or bandwidth to carry out the work of the agencies.
But Rykov knew that for the time being, he’d need more help than ever from church volunteers.
“Without your intervention here, this is gonna be a humanitarian disaster in Nashville,” he told them in the online meeting held about a week after the cuts. “And in every community, obviously, but we were focusing on ours. We’re not gonna be in a position to help in the same way much longer, and this is a stark reality that we’re facing.”
Then he went on the local news, warning that “this immediate funding freeze puts those recently arrived refugees really at risk of homelessness.” The responses on social media reflected the hate and intolerance that had polluted the national conversation about immigration.
“The common theme was, ‘Refugees? Do you mean “illegal invaders”?’” Rykov recalled. “People are so completely misinformed, clearly not reading the article or watching the story, and it’s very disappointing to see that. And I guess it’s sad too that I expect it.”
One Month After the Cuts
 “No Time to Screw Around”

In late February, church volunteer Abdul Makembe and a program manager from NICE squeezed into the cramped apartment of a family of five from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Both Makembe and NICE had been working with the family for months, but with the loss of funding, NICE could no longer offer support and had asked Makembe to be more involved.
A native of Tanzania, Makembe moved to Tennessee in the late 1970s. After working in infectious disease research and nonprofit management, which involved several trips to Africa, he retired in 2015 and began volunteering to help newly arrived African families. Rykov came to know him as a fixture of the refugee community, always eager to help.
In the apartment, Makembe perched on the edge of a couch and Mungaga Akilimali sat across from him on the floor.
“So, the situation has improved a little bit?” Makembe asked.
The Congolese man ran his hands over his head.
“The situation, so far, not yet,” Akilimali said. “I’m just trying to apply and reapply and reapply, but so far nothing.”
Akilimali and his family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. Since 1996, soldiers and militias have killed 6 million people there and committed atrocities against countless civilians. War, political instability and widespread poverty have displaced millions of others.

Akilimali and his wife settled for a time in South Africa, where they encountered xenophobia and anti-immigrant violence. Immigrants and refugees have become political scapegoats there, spawning a rash of attacks and even murders. His wife, Bulonza Chishamara, nearly died there in 2018 after an ambush by an anti-immigrant mob.
Doctors gave her eight units of blood and Chishamara spent days paralyzed in a hospital bed, Akilimali said. She still walks with a limp.
The family had rejoiced when they got approved for refugee resettlement in 2024 in Tennessee. Their new life in Nashville began with promise. Akilimali, who speaks fluent English and trained as a mechanic, got a driver’s license and a job at Nissan.
However, he lost the job before his probationary period ended due to layoffs, and he hasn’t been able to find another one. NICE used to have a robust staff of employment specialists. But the cuts forced the organization to reassign them.
That left fewer resources for people like Akilimali, who had been in the U.S. longer than the three months during which new refugees were eligible for state department aid but who still needed help finding work.
For Rykov, the work of spreading awareness about the cuts and raising funds to offset them intensified throughout February. He and others working with refugees across the country were hoping that the courts might force the administration to release the federal money — that if they could keep things afloat in the short term, relief would come.
Then, on Feb. 25, a federal judge in Washington ruled in favor of the agencies. He ordered the administration to restore payments and restart refugee admissions.
The relief was short-lived. A day later, the administration canceled contracts with resettlement agencies, and lawyers for the administration have appealed the order. Their argument: The gutted refugee agencies no longer have capacity to restart resettlement, making it impossible to comply with court orders.
Rykov said some of the diminished number of remaining staff members began to look for new jobs.
After that, Rykov and his team kicked into emergency mode. They worked long hours making phone calls and arranging meetings with potential volunteers and donors.
“It was a cocktail of emotions,” he said. The generosity of donors and volunteers filled him with gratitude. But he couldn’t escape the sense of foreboding that consumed the office, where many desks sat empty and remaining employees voiced deepening concerns about the fates of their clients.
Rykov likened the urgent energy at NICE to the aftermath of a natural disaster. “There’s no time to screw around.”
At the same time, staffers worried about the cratering budget and the future of the organization. And it was hard not to notice how much the mood in Tennessee and around the country was shifting. In an order suspending refugee admissions, Trump described immigrants as a “burden” who have “inundated” American towns and cities.NICE had always felt protected, powered by an idealistic and diverse staff who chose to work in refugee resettlement despite the long hours and low pay. The cuts and the discourse eroded that sense of safety, Rykov said.
In February, a tech company offered him a job in Birmingham. It was a chance to be closer to his parents and back in the city where he’d come of age — a reminder of an era that felt kinder than the current one. He took the job.
“Working at NICE, it’s the best job I ever had and the most meaningful job I ever had,” he said.
Rykov packed up a few things from NICE. A Ukrainian flag lapel pin. A signed photograph of him and his coworkers. In his Birmingham apartment, he placed the picture on a bookshelf next to one of him and his parents at his high school graduation.
By the time he left, NICE’s refugee resettlement team was down to 30 employees; it had been 56 before the cuts. For its part, NICE has vowed to carry on. The organization has paired 24 families with volunteer mentors since the funding cuts.
Church volunteers, who were accustomed to helping furnish and decorate apartments for new arrivals, now had to help prevent evictions. They had to track down documents and help complete paperwork lost in the confusion of the nonprofit’s layoffs. And the group of mostly retired professionals now had to assist with the daunting task of finding unskilled jobs for refugees who didn’t speak much English.
Two Months After the Cuts
 One Volunteer, Many People in Need

On a mid-March morning, Makembe woke at 6 a.m. to begin tackling his volunteer work for NICE. Despite the long hours he clocks volunteering, the 74-year-old has kept his energy level and his spirits up. As he left the garage apartment he shares with his wife in a rough north Nashville neighborhood, he made sure to double-check the locks.
On this day, he was working not with the Akilimali family but with a family of four who recently arrived from Africa. The child needs to see a specialist at the Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt.
It was Vanderbilt that brought Makembe to Nashville decades ago, for his master’s degree in economic planning. He followed that with a doctorate in health policy and research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Over the years that followed, he made repeated trips back to Tanzania to do research on malaria and parasitic infections.
All that took a toll on Makembe’s marriage, and he and his first wife divorced when his two children were very young. They are now grown and successful. His son is an accountant and his daughter recently finished law school and works at a firm in New York. That leaves him more time to spend with refugees.
But the volunteer work does bring some financial stress. He is trying to save $5,000 to apply for a green card for his wife, which is tough. Because he spent much of his career working outside the U.S., Makembe receives less than $1,000 a month from Social Security. He drives a 2004 Toyota that was donated to his church to aid the congregation’s work with refugees, but he pays out of pocket for gas and car insurance. The costs can add up. It’s not uncommon for him to burn a quarter tank of gas a day when he is volunteering.
Makembe’s church, Woodmont Hills Church, is a significant contributor to the city’s refugee resettlement work — an ethos shared by its current congregants but that has led to the loss of members over the years. Though it had a congregation nearing 3,000 members in the late ’90s, attendance shrank as the church’s ideology grew more progressive and Tennessee’s grew more conservative. It’s now down to 800 members.
Yet the church remained steadfast in its commitment to helping refugees. Its leaders invited NICE to hold classes in its empty meeting rooms and made space to house a Swahili church and a Baptist church formed by refugees from Myanmar. And when NICE lost funding, Woodmont Hills members donated their time and money.
Makembe has helped dozens of refugees over the years but was particularly worried for the family he had to take to the Children’s Hospital that March morning, serving as both driver and translator. They arrived right before Trump cut off funding, and they had struggled to get medical care for their 5-year-old’s persistent seizures. A doctor at a local clinic had prescribed antiseizure medication, but it didn’t work, and the child experienced episodes where his muscles tensed and froze for minutes at a time.
Nashville has world-class medical facilities, but NICE no longer had staff available to help the family understand and navigate that care, leaving them frustrated.
It took months for the family to get in to see a specialist. During the long wait, Makembe said, the boy’s father began to lose hope. His son’s seizures had become longer and more frequent. Makembe stepped in to help them get a referral from a doctor at the local clinic.
The child’s father had to miss the doctor’s appointment that March morning so that he could go to an interview at a company that packages computer parts. Both he and his wife had been searching for jobs and striking out. Makembe has tried to help but has run into barriers. He does not have the same connections with labor agencies that NICE staffers did.
Makembe said he wants to get the child enrolled in a special school for the fall and find a wheelchair so his mom won’t have to carry him.
And that’s just this family. Makembe said new refugees have been waiting for months to get job interviews. When he visits the five families he mentors, their neighbors approach him asking for help. Many of their requests are for the assistance NICE and other refugee agencies once offered.
“I’m very much worried,” he said. “I mean, they have no idea of what to do.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250226-Gray-DOGE-Tennessee-Refugee-Cuts-11-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-16 07:05:48.030069

Mike Crapo (center) takes part in a listening breakfast at the Idaho State Capitol Building in Boise on June 2, 2017. (Lance Cheung/USDA)U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in an April 8 op-ed that “access to affordable housing is one of the most pressing issues” he encounters across Idaho. 
He has asked that Idahoans participate in a housing survey so he can develop policy solutions. The senator is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over issues that can profoundly affect housing in Idaho – trade, taxes, Medicaid and Social Security. He could actually have a tremendously positive effect on housing availability in the Gem State, merely by using his clout on this powerful committee, without needing a survey.
Donald Trump’s tariffs pose a serious threat to affordable housing by substantially increasing the costs of construction, remodeling and mortgage financing. 
Crapo could immediately join a bipartisan effort to take back the Constitutional power of Congress to regulate trade and tariffs. Congressional approval of Senate Joint Resolution 49 would terminate the tariffs, allowing Congress to target China with tariffs in specific industries where they would do some actual good. 
Crapo held an April 8 hearing on trade policy, but gave no indication he supported the resolution or any other means of stopping Trump’s tariff chaos. Crapo needs to hear from voters on the necessity of legislative action to prevent harmful tariff-related escalation of housing costs.
As chairman of the Finance Committee, Crapo should shoot down the false claims of Elon Musk that the Social Security system is a “Ponzi scheme” riddled with fraud. Musk has failed to provide an iota of proof. Someone in a position of authority should tell him to provide proof or shut his trap. 
Social Security is a lifeline for elderly Americans who contributed to the system. Many live from check to check, depending on those payments to stay in their homes or apartments. As Musk has rifled through the private personal information of older Americans, he is causing the system to break down. If retired folk lose their housing as a result of his misconduct, there really will be a crisis.
The Republicans in Congress seem intent on savaging another program that provides housing to senior citizens of modest means. Medicaid is the primary payer source for 65% of the residents in Idaho’s certified nursing facilities. If Crapo and other GOP members of Congress cut $880 billion out of the Medicaid program to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, it is not clear where those folks will find alternate housing.
Strangely, Crapo’s April 8 op-ed transitions from housing affordability to the issue of those tax cuts for the rich. Crapo is desperate to permanently extend the 2017 tax cut law that was massively skewed in favor of the top one percent. 
It has been reliably estimated that extension of the tax cuts without commensurate cuts in spending would add $4.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years and $37 trillion by 2054. The debt currently stands at $36 trillion. 
The richest 5% of Americans would receive 40% of the benefits of extension in the first year alone. 
Sen. Crapo has been the leading advocate for a smoke-and-mirrors budget policy that would essentially ignore the fact that spending would exceed revenue by more than $4 trillion over 10 years. Crapo is championing the “current policy baseline” that essentially overlooks the effect of adding unlimited years to the 2017 tax cuts. 
Prominent GOP budget experts say it would be a “recipe for disaster, a fiscal Pandora’s box.” The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has called the scheme “ a blueprint for miring us in even more debt.” 
It may be that Crapo is merely looking out for the housing interests of the super rich, making sure that they have opulent housing options around the globe. For the ordinary American, the tax scheme does not offer much tax relief, and it certainly does nothing to address the affordable housing issue.
Were Congress to adopt Crapo’s fiscally-irresponsible budget gimmick, borrowing cost would rise out of sight, endangering everyone’s access to reasonable mortgage rates for housing. With the burgeoning national debt and reluctance of investors to continue financing America’s massive and growing debt, lending rates for housing will likely rise above the reach of most Americans.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution Tuesday opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “operating outside the limits of the law in and around the Milwaukee County Courthouse Complex,” while also calling on the sheriff to work with the county executive and chief judge of the First Judicial District to “ensure access to services and safeguard every individual’s constitutional right to due process.” 
During the board committee meeting Chairwoman Marcelia Nicholson called the resolution, which she authored with Supervisors Caroline Gomez-Tom and Juan Miguel Martinez, both “reactive” and “proactive.” The resolution also calls for Milwaukee County residents to be educated on their rights during immigration encounters, such as distributing educational material around the courthouse complex.

“Let me be clear,” Nicholson said, “everyone regardless of immigration status deserves due process. And that’s not a radical idea, that’s the Constitution. And yet when federal immigration enforcement takes place in our courthouse complex, it sends families into hiding, deters survivors of violence from seeking protection and discourages tenants from asserting their rights.” Nicholson said that “it erodes trust in the very systems we are responsible for upholding.”
In early April, the community learned of two ICE arrests in the county courthouse. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office said in a press statement that ICE had not given prior notice of one of the arrests and that the sheriff’s office was not involved in making the arrests. Days later, the men were identified as Edwin Bustamante-Sierre, 27, and Marco Cruz-Garcia, 24. ICE said that the men had been convicted of violent crimes or were linked to gangs. Online court records show that one of the men, Cruz-Garcia, was arrested the same day he went to family court for a domestic violence-related restraining order, which was dropped that day. 
Nicholson said the arrests took place in the “public hallways of our courthouse and Safety Building.” She added, “That action didn’t just detain individuals, it delivered a message: ‘This space may not be safe for people who look a certain way, or speaks a certain language.’” 
The arrests were widely condemned by local officials and activists. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement that the courthouse “stands as a cornerstone of justice where residents come to seek information, resources and fair participation in the legal process” and that “an attack on this safe, community-serving space undermines public trust, breeds fear among citizens and staff and disrupts the due process essential to our courts.” 
Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley, as well as members of the Board of Supervisors also decried the arrests. Local groups from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin to Voces de la Frontera, and the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression also blasted ICE for making arrests in the courthouse.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The ACLU highlighted that ICE enforcement often causes immigrant communities to avoid contacting law enforcement, even when they are in danger of becoming crime victims. On April 10, Congresswoman Gwen Moore said in a statement that “ICE has seemingly front-run Milwaukee’s justice system, potentially denying the city justice and potential victims a remedy.” Moore added, “This Administration’s decision to remove sensitive location protections will stir even more fear in our communities, prevent victims of crime from coming forward, and disrupt houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.”
In a joint statement Nicholson, Gomez-Tom, and Miguel Martinez said that the resolution “puts us on the right side of history and the right side of humanity.” The resolution is “about helping people … protection process…[and] protecting the promise of what our Courthouse is meant to be – a place of fairness, access, and truth.” 
During public testimony on Tuesday, Sup. Willie Johnson Jr. said that he agreed that the arrests “were an erosion of trust”. Echoing Nicholson’s words Johnson said that “we are stewards of Milwaukee County government, we represent the citizens of this county and we should be respectful of the rights of people to go about their business, be where they need to be, and do what they need to do.” 
Sup. Miguel Martinez said “this is just the first step towards creating more action.” The board is expecting a report back from the sheriff and county executive regarding rules around the courthouse, he  said.
“This administration really is descending into 1939 Nazi Germany,” Miguel Martinez continued. “And I’m not saying that with hyperbole because there’s people that are getting deported and people that are citizens, and are not returning. We have people with residency getting their residency stripped away from them. And every single day, it descends into more and more madness.”
He said that it was the responsibility of board members “as local representatives of our communities, that we make sure that we fight every single day against this unlawful administration, and make sure that we let everybody know that we are here to protect them, and we won’t let our country descend into absolute tyrannical madness.”
Sup. Gomez-Tom added that it is the county government’s responsibility “to serve our community, and all inhabitants of our county.” Milwaukee County residents go to the courthouse for many different services besides the justice system, including victim services, child support or obtaining legal documents, “and everyone should have a right to do so, and to do so in peace,” said Gomez-Tom.

Supervisors Anne O’Connor said that to her knowledge, the Trump administration is the first to pursue immigration arrests in what were once considered “safe places” such as courthouses or churches. 
At a press conference she attended in the days after the arrests, O’Connor said, ICE agents were parked illegally outside and wouldn’t identify themselves further. She described the feeling as “a cloak of anonymity” and said her constituents are concerned about vulnerable communities such as resettled Afghan-U.S. allies, Rohingya, and Congolese communities who get services from nonprofits.
Sup. Patti Logsdon abstained from voting on the resolution’s passage, saying her decision “is not a reflection of indifference or opposition to the values of justice or fairness,” but concern about the legal uncertainty surrounding the passing and implications of this resolution.” 
Logsdon asked for legal guidance as to what policies the county has in place already to guide ICE interactions, as well as the legal jeopardy elected officials who support policies that could conflict with federal immigration law may find themselves. Logsdon also questioned whether Milwaukee County could be sued for going against immigration enforcement, who would pay for it and how much it would cost “in defending and educating undocumented immigrants about their rights.”
Several members of the public also attended the board meeting, expressing support for the resolution, concern for immigrant communities and opposition to  Trump administration immigration policies.
Gomez-Tom noted that she is the daughter of Mexican immigrants.  “I know what that chilling effect looks like when someone in your family is at risk…maybe isn’t even at risk, but is scared that they could be at risk of being detained, of being questioned,” she said. “What happens is people get paralyzed.”

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
Debate headed for ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
 

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting marijuana potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
 

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

(Darrin Klimek | Getty Images)“Our correctional industry leaders and employees have recognized that operating a successful prison system includes preparing the incarcerated population for a productive life outside of the system. This effort involves parole and probation agencies, social service providers, work-release employers, and support from the community.” — Joe Thornton, former Secretary of the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety (DMAPS) 
West Virginia is sometimes unfairly criticized by outsiders that are unaware of the state’s many positives, such as its friendly people and beautiful, scenic mountains. But even the state’s residents may not be aware of some of West Virginia’s other accomplishments. For example, the successful rehabilitation of people exiting state prisons. 
A recent report by Suzuki Law found that West Virginia’s recidivism rate is lower than all but four states. This positive finding is consistent with a PEW survey taken more than a decade ago which also found West Virginia to have the fourth lowest recidivism rate. 
More broadly, the American criminal justice system must do more than just say “goodbye” to discharged inmates; it must take pro-active steps to help with a very difficult transition. As indicated below, such action results in all of us being safer and lessens our tax burden.
 A large portion of the world’s total inmates are here in the United States, where almost a half million new inmates enter the system each year. Currently, we have nearly 2 million people incarcerated, the majority in state prisons at tremendous cost to state taxpayers. And 1 out of 5 are in jail due to mostly non-violent drug offenses. 
States like West Virginia with lower recidivism rates have more effective programs for dealing with people convicted of crimes and eventually released. While West Virginia’s 24% recidivism rate may sound high to the uninformed, it is less than half that of Delaware (65%), the highest state. And West Virginia’s historically lower rate did not simply happen by accident, prison reform has been a priority for a while.  
In 2013 and 2015, Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin and West Virginia’s Legislature made a very conscious decision to identify and employ “scientifically validated” “best practices” to improve the state’s justice system, for both youth and adults. In a rare illustration of how government can — and should — work, both the GOP and the Democrats agreed on the need for reform. Then, together, they accomplished it, all without pointing fingers as is so common in 2025.  
Senate Bill 371 (2013) enacted reforms regarding the adult offender system. The Justice Reinvestment Initiative employed assessment and treatment of “behavioral health and substance abuse” to reduce recidivism. Instead of incarceration, the state established “day report centers,” successfully utilizing “treatment and recovery services” versus incarceration. 
Senate Bill 393 (2015) zeroed in on “at-risk youth” where they lived, providing them with home-based guidance and mentoring. Previously, these children were committed to youth detention facilities, i.e. jails. As a state planning and budgeting senior analyst, I visited and evaluated such facilities in Georgia in the 1970s. I guarantee you that they were problematic, as well as personally disturbing. 
It is a true shame that other red and blue states with high recidivism rates — such as Delaware, Alaska, Arkansas, Rhode Island and Colorado — have not come together to install scientifically based reforms that have been proven to be successful in West Virginia and other more enlightened states. Per one legal expert, “By adopting evidence-based rehabilitation programs and supporting former inmates in their transition back into society, we can reduce recidivism rates, improve public safety, and ease the economic burden on taxpayers.” 
High recidivism can be reduced by providing inmate educational and rehabilitation opportunities, and support after release from prison including employment assistance, housing and education. But the first step is to recognize that there is a problem. 
Jim Rubenstein, a past WVDOC Commissioner, once stated, “I am proud of our staff’s commitment to the WVDOC’s goal of reducing offender recidivism.” Mr. Rubenstein, everyone reading this column will agree. I just hope other states will follow in your footsteps.

LITTLE ROCK — Crop-related flood damage in Arkansas from early April rains totals a “conservative” $78.9 million, according to estimates from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
Of the nearly 840,000 acres reported planted as of April 7 in the state, 31% was reported as flooded, and agronomists and economists warn additional acreage may flood as water moves downstream.
From April 2-6, Arkansas and parts of the Mid-South endured a series of storms culminating in what the National Weather Service labeled “generational” flooding. With more than a foot of rain falling in some locations, moderate and major flooding occurred along the Cache, Black, White and Ouachita rivers. Water levels along those rivers were not expected to decline significantly through April 18.
The UA System analysis estimated the total replanting expenses from flooded acres for corn, rice and soybeans to be $42.04 million. The estimated replanting cost per commodity is:

Corn — $11.44 million
Rice — $20.91 million
Soybeans — $9.68 million.

Winter wheat damaged by flooding won’t be replanted, and with fertilizer and other inputs already invested in the crop, wheat growers will still face production losses and sunk cost of production. This places the loss for wheat at around $18 million, the analysis said.
The value of federal crop insurance indemnities — the amount insurance would pay back to farmers — is estimated at $18.69 million.
Agriculture is the state’s largest industry, valued at more than $24 billion.
The Division of Agriculture released a fact sheet on Tuesday outlining these preliminary damage calculations. Agricultural economists and agronomists from the Division of Agriculture made their calculations based on observations from county Cooperative Extension Service agents.

“We recognize that this is likely a conservative estimate as we have not accounted for yield loss resulting from late planting, damage to farm structures such as grain bins, and unreported acreage that is flooded,” said Hunter Biram, extension economist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
“We note that these losses are one-third of the projected economic assistance to be received by Arkansas crop producers highlighting the significance of this flood event in the face of multi-year declines in net farm income and heightened market volatility.”
When calculating the total damage costs, planting expenses are estimated using operating costs from the 2025 University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture crop enterprise budgets, said Ryan Loy, extension economist for the Division of Agriculture.
“Only cost items such as seed, fertilizer, herbicides, labor and diesel are incurred when replanting a crop, while the remaining operating expenses — including crop insurance, interest and cash rent — are only incurred in the initial planting.”
Deacue Fields, head of the Division of Agriculture who is also an agricultural economist, said the damage assessment is critical to help obtain aid for affected farmers.
“We created this assessment to help our farmers and are sharing our findings with Gov. [Sarah Huckabee] Sanders and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” he said, “Both are in a position to help the people of Arkansas agriculture through this very difficult time.
“We truly appreciate the speed at which our agents and faculty collected and processed this information under very difficult conditions,” Fields said.
The Division of Agriculture will conduct additional surveys to further refine the damage estimate.

Along the lower White River, the National Weather Service posted flood warnings until further notice.
Last week, Craighead County rice farmer Joe Christian posted an aerial photo of his farm on X, which showed the vast scale of the flooding. In it, the white roof of a storage shed surrounded by acres of brown water, with a few trees and outlines of fields visible.
Satellite analysis
Jason Davis, assistant professor remote sensing and pesticides application and extension specialist, was analyzing satellite imagery of the flooding to be paired and validated against ground observations made by extension agents.
“We’re one of the very few organizations that can do this,” Davis said. “With our direct connection to producers through both specialists and the county extension agents we are one of the very few organizations in the state that have the network to do this kind of validation with such a quick turnaround.”
For his analysis, Davis has downloaded imagery of 11 million acres in Arkansas’ Delta. The images are multispectral, so in addition to visible light, he has near-infrared images which can be used to “show very clearly where the water is.”
Using the visible and near-infrared images to create false color imagery, all water — “even the really turbid water that may look similar to soil in visible spectrum imagery, pops as fluorescent blue so it can be differentiated as flooded.”
Davis said he will also produce a “quantified map of where the water is pixel by pixel, so we can calculate the number of flooded acres by that. I use those two methods to calculate and validate where the water is.”
Davis said he overlays the satellite imagery with maps from the National Agricultural Statistics Service showing “where crop fields are and what commodity that field was planted in each year.”  While the NASS data is from 2024, agronomists and economists can use these numbers as a baseline to adjust estimates based on what was planted and crop rotations.
Rice
The problem plaguing all farmers right now is uncertainty as water drains southward.
“We are still so much in the middle of this insanity,” said Jarrod Hardke, extension rice agronomist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. In the next few days,  “there is ground where the water is coming off and ground that is just now going under.”
The rising water won’t be dramatic like the original flood event, but farmers “will just start to see water getting deeper every day,” he said.
In the Payneway community, “they started sandbagging it last Wednesday, expecting it to flood this coming Wednesday,” Hardke said Monday. “They’re having to read the tea leaves about when and how this is all going to play out.”
Complicating the predictions are the different rates at which the rivers — all tributaries of the Mississippi River — drain.
“There’s the expectation that when the Mississippi River crest gets to Helena, that they’re going to need to protect the Mississippi River levees. They’ll be turning off their pumps and that means a lot of the water we’re draining out of the St. Francis and other rivers is going to start to back up.”
As for a rice redo, “we know we have a ton of levy damage and impacts. Tearing down and rebuilding damaged levees — that’s a substantial investment of time and money,” Hardke said.
“There is actually a little bit of replant seed available — seed that was deliberately held back for that purpose,” Hardke said. “But it’s going to be hit or miss depending on the type of rice they need.”
Soybeans
Jeremy Ross, extension soybean agronomist for the Division of Agriculture, said the high moisture levels left by the flooding are causing seedling diseases in stands that have emerged.
However, “we are still in the heart of the optimum planting window,” he said. “With less than 15 percent of the crop planted, there’s still time to maximize yield.”
Growers looking for seed to replant their soybeans may “not get the same variety you had, but you can still get the herbicide technology you’re looking for.
“The way I look at it is the best scenario is cotton and peanuts because nothing has been planted,” Ross said. “Second best is going to be soybeans, just because seed supply is really good.”
Ross cited the case of a grower in east central Arkansas who planted 2,700 acres of soybeans and 300 acres of corn.
“They’re going to have to replant the whole farm because of drowned soybeans and being hit pretty hard with seedling diseases,” Ross said. “But while it’s a bad situation, it could be worse. It’ll be a little more cost to recondition the beds, run the planter and then make an additional herbicide application, but they still have an opportunity to maximize their soybean yield.”
Corn
When it comes to corn, growers are also still within a good planting window, said Jason Kelley, extension wheat and feed grains agronomist for the Division of Agriculture. He said there should be seed available for replanting, but “it’s probably not going to be the grower’s first choice. They might get their second, third or fourth choices.”
Kelley said the late planting date for full crop insurance is April 25 in southern Arkansas and May 1 for northeast Arkansas, so most people are going to be able to get back in the field and replant corn before yields start dropping from late planting.”
Some growers that had corn emerging and plan to replant will have an unusual task: killing the rain-damaged first stand before planting again, since the partial initial stand will act like a weed for the replanted corn.
“A lot of people are probably just going to use tillage to get rid of the first stand as many of the raised beds are eroded down that irrigation later in the season may not be as effective,” Kelley said.
Raised bed erosion is a real issue “Producers may have planted the seed 2 inches deep,” he said. However, when the heavy rains came, “those beds ‘melted down,’ so now that seed isn’t 2 inches deep and it’s not nearly deep enough for proper root development, which can lead to plants falling over and plant loss.
“The silver lining is that if this rain happened a month from now, it would have been even more devasting since now, at least, we have an opportunity to replant corn,” he said.
Wheat
Kelley said, “Unfortunately for the wheat crop, we’ve got almost all the expenses in it already —seed, fertilizer, herbicides — so we’re basically waiting on harvest,” he said.
“Wheat can handle some water for a couple days like other crops, but the quicker the water recedes, the better,” Kelley said. “If the wheat is heading or in the flowering stage and the flood water is deep enough to go over the heads that would most likely result in blank heads with no grain.”

The proposal, House Bill 636, drew concerns from Democratic representatives over the subjectivity of which books are “harmful to minors” or “pervasively vulgar,” the standard for removal set by the bill, as well as protests from members of the public, some of whom were ejected by the sergeant-at-arms for vocal disruptions.
The bill requires each of the state’s 116 school districts to establish a committee made up of five parents or guardians and five educators tasked with reviewing all school library material for sexual content to determine if it is in violation of the state guidelines, as well as new additions and any book fair offerings. The bill declares any media containing “descriptions or visual depictions of sexual activity” to be inappropriate for all ages and grade levels.
The State Board of Education would be required to maintain a database of all banned media across the state and update it annually. In addition, objections from 10 parents, residents, or teachers would be sufficient to require the review of specific library materials. While the bill leaves final say over what materials should be included in libraries with school governing bodies, it also opens up a private right of action for parents, guardians, and residents to sue over noncompliance with the law by any school.
The bill comes amid a wave of book bans around the country as Republican-controlled legislatures have sought to give parents a veto over the material their children can access at school. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 10,000 instances of book banning took place around the country, PEN America found. Critics of the bans say books on LGBTQ+ and racial topics are disproportionately subject to removal, alleging ideological rather than educational motives for the restrictions.
Rep. Neal Jackson (R-Moore), one of the bill’s primary sponsors, contended that the removal process is “absolutely not book banning,” pointing to Supreme Court precedent that schools may bar any content that are “pervasively vulgar or educationally unsuitable.” He said controlling available library media is critical for parental rights.
“It’s not about fiction books. It’s not about nonfiction books. It’s not about novels,” Jackson said. “Very simply, it’s about pornography and not allowing pornography in our public school libraries.”

But that argument left opponents of the bill unconvinced. Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said she feared books like Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple,” which depicts a young girl experiencing and overcoming rape, would likely be subject to bans despite their literary and educational value.
“That’s book banning, that’s censorship, that’s one of the all-time great books that kids learn to read with, that they get an interest in,” Morey said, comparing moves to ban controversial media to George Orwell’s “1984.” “I don’t see the line, I see subjectivity, and I’m really, really worried about that. I have very serious concerns that this is total censorship.”
Rep. David Willis (R-Union), another primary sponsor, said books like “The Color Purple” are not the target of the legislation, calling characterization of the bill as a book banning measure “personally offensive.” He said there is a clear legal definition of “what is vulgar, what is obscene, and what is pornography” that does not encompass books with educational merit.
“That is not what this is designed to do and the folks in this committee understand that clearly,” Willis said. “If I were to take one of these books and walk across the mall and sit down with one of the tour groups of kids that come through there every single day and start reading aloud — and start exposing the book and the pictures in these books — it wouldn’t take very long for me to get arrested.”
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said that despite the lawmakers’ assertion that the bill seeks to protect parental rights, it instead infringes upon them by allowing other parents to block her children’s reading material. She recalled a teacher contacting her because her son, then a fourth grader, was reading “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,” a book that depicts the horrors of the Holocaust.
“It’s my job as the parent, not the school’s and not the government’s, to determine what is appropriate,” Budd said. “This is in fact book banning and a very slippery slope, because what you define as wholesome may not be the same for me.”
HB 636 was also approved the House Rules Committee Tuesday afternoon and is scheduled for a vote before the full House on Wednesday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:59:13.397100

(Getty Images)Imagine being 35 years old and facing the reality that without the necessary help you would be forced into a nursing home. 
For many people with disabilities who live in Pennsylvania, this is not just a hypothetical — it’s a looming threat.
I’ve received home care since I was 18 years old, and because of it, I’m able to live in my own home, participate in my community, develop my hobbies, and advocate for others with disabilities. 
I live a full life. And that is because I’ve received care in the participant-directed model. This means I get to choose who provides my care and how it is delivered. This autonomy is critical — not only for my personal freedom and well-being but for the overall efficiency of the healthcare system. 
By avoiding agency profits and overhead, the participant-directed care system puts money back in the pockets of our care givers, ensuring state dollars are going where they belong. Investing in participant direction saves the state Medicaid program millions of dollars a year, an important consideration as our community-based service system continues to expand and federal funds become uncertain. 
Despite the vital role our home caregivers play, they remain drastically underpaid and undervalued. This chronic lack of funding threatens the future of self-direction, and self-dignity, for Pennsylvanians like myself.
My caregiver, Lynn provides deeply personal and essential services to me, such as lifting, dressing, and assisting with my hygiene. Even with decades of experience, she struggles to pay medical expenses for herself.
How can we expect caregivers to provide quality care when they are barely surviving financially?
Thankfully, there is recognition at the state level that change needs to occur to make progress. Governor Josh Shapiro’s 2025-26 budget proposal includes $21 million to support participant-directed care so that for the first time ever, caregivers such as Lynn, would receive the financial security they deserve. This includes a wage increase and funding paid time off. 
Participant-directed home care is essential. It is fiscally responsible. And it enables self-determination. Let’s start treating it that way.

(Courtesy the Berglund Center)Autumn Bushman’s age when she killed herself is unfathomable, gut-wrenching. The Roanoke County girl was just 10 years old, and her parents say she’d been bullied – citing that as a key factor in her death. Unfortunately, Autumn’s death reflects a troubling national trend: Children are taking their own lives more frequently.
Her  March 21 suicide in her own home has caused immeasurable grief for her family, and it has stunned a Southwest Virginia community. The incident, brought to wider attention by The Washington Post, should force all of us to grapple with some disturbing questions:
Are Virginia schools intervening sufficiently when bullying or harassment occurs? Are parents equipped with enough tools to discern normal adolescent angst from something more serious – and potentially fatal? Should parents prevent their children from having smartphones because of the constant bombardment of digital conversations that can be mean-spirited and abrasive?
Autumn had a smartphone, but her parents said they didn’t let her have her own social media accounts. Chuck Lionberger, a county schools spokesman, said in a statement the division encourages “parents to not give students access to smart phones and social media until age 14, to closely monitor online interactions, and to report any bullying concerns to the school so that we can work with parents to intervene.”
He also told me that elementary school students aren’t allowed to have cellphones in school.
The presence of smartphones is a key difference between yesteryear and today. Back then, you could put classroom nonsense and threats behind you when you went home. Today, social media and cellphones make that impossible.
Suicide prevention is a priority for me now

One bittersweet development since Autumn’s death: a call from all quarters for kindness, empathy and understanding. That was the message Sunday at the Berglund Center in Roanoke in a celebration of her life that was dedicated, in part, to squashing bullying; 300 people showed up, a center spokesman said. Folks have bought “Be Kind for Autumn” shirts. A forum April 29 in a neighboring county will focus on bullying.
“It seems like there’s a blind eye” toward the problem, Town of Rocky Mount Mayor Holland Perdue, organizer of the forum, told me. He’s been commenting online about the problem for months, and Perdue said some children in his area are being homeschooled now because of bullying.
The Post reported the family opened up Autumn’s funeral to the wider community and broadcast it live, hoping the fourth-grader’s story might inspire more tolerance. The young girl’s hobbies and extracurriculars included cheerleading, track, dance and archery.
A county police spokeswoman said last week the investigation of Autumn’s death is still active, pending the medical examiner’s report. Police also took her smartphone. 
“Police may examine devices to piece together the events leading up to a death,” Amy Whittaker told me by email.
Kids who are bullied are at risk of suicide, but bullying alone is not the cause, according to the government website Stopbullying.gov. “Many issues contribute to suicide risk, including depression, problems at home, and trauma history,” it said.
Yet federal statistics show suicidal thoughts among adolescents have worsened over the period from 2013 to 2023. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing a national youth risk survey released last year, said 19% of children in 2023 reported being bullied at school during the past year.
The survey found that in 2023, 16% of students made a suicide plan and 9% attempted suicide. Those numbers were slightly higher than in 2013.
I reached out to health care officials at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, which operates Children’s Pavilion. That facility, which opened in 2022, provides inpatient pediatric mental health treatment and related services.
Dr. John Fanton, child and adolescent psychiatrist, noted that evaluating mental health illnesses has “come a long way, and we’re doing much more now in terms of screening and educating” and alerting families about risks.
Decades of national suicide prevention policies haven’t slowed the deaths

However, “the science has not evolved to the level where we can do 100% screening 100%  of the time,” Fanton added. “There’s no app, no equivalent of a stress test” that indicates what risk category a child will be in up to a year from now.
Parents should monitor their children’s mood, sleep patterns and changes in eating habits to consider whether something is hugely awry, said Stephanie Osler, director of mental health hospital support.
“If you see sudden changes, as a parent, you need to be vigilant,” added Osler, a licensed clinical social worker. Some changes in behavior might be normal. “But if they’re missing out on things, their grades are dropping, and they’re not as engaged on things they enjoy,” those are red flags, she said.
Both officials lead the mental health emergency department assessment team. They noted the arrival of smartphones and social media have made it tougher for children to distance themselves from external criticism – some of it especially harsh and cruel.
Autumn’s parents, Mark and Summer Bushman, as well as other parents and students in her school division, have questioned whether Roanoke County Public Schools handle complaints about bullying properly, and if the penalties go far enough. The current policy was discussed last week during a county school board meeting.
Summer told The Post she contacted her daughter’s school, Mountain View Elementary, early on to report concerning behavior. But, she said, she never received a clear explanation — only that the situation had been “handled.”
Mark, in another report, said, “As far as we know, what we were told – at least by our daughter – was that (the bullying) kept happening.”  
The division, in a statement spokesman Lionberger emailed to me, says it takes “all reports of bullying and conflicts among students very seriously. Our schools educate students and respond appropriately to specific situations when we are made aware, including working with parents and families of students involved.” He said federal privacy laws prevented him from discussing the specifics of Autumn’s case.
At the School Board meeting, when a division official noted the schools must legally notify parents about bullying accusations, Summer Bushman blurted out: “I was never notified. … My daughter is dead!” 
Lionberger told me later he couldn’t discuss that allegation, again citing federal privacy laws.
Since the 2022-23 school year, he said, the division had collected 72 bullying incidents without injuries, and none with injuries. It had tallied eight complaints of cyberbullying. There were three repeat bullying complaints.
Suicides among Autumn’s age group are low in the commonwealth, but still dispiriting. For ages 8-12, the Virginia Department of Health reported six deaths in 2022, one in 2023 and two in 2024, a spokeswoman said.
Nationally, though, the story has been shocking. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health found rates of suicide in the 8-12 age group have been increasing by approximately 8% annually since 2008, the institute said last year.
NIH noted the overall numbers remain low.
Autumn’s death is a wake-up call. Ask your own children questions about their emotional state. Stay involved with them. Consult counselors and psychiatrists. Know the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.
Make all of that Autumn’s legacy.

Patients seeking psychiatric treatment sometimes had to wait days in Chesapeake Regional Medical Center’s emergency room for space at facilities across the state to open up, the hospital told the state in 2022.
Now those patients will have their own space on-site dedicated to treating them quickly.
“For far too long, individuals in this region experiencing a mental health crisis have had limited access to focused, immediate and respectful care. Today, that changes,” Amber Egyud, Chesapeake Regionals’ chief operating and nursing officer, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony April 7 for the hospital’s new psychiatric emergency room.
The room will allow those in need of psychiatric care to get away from the stress of a typical ER and connect directly with appropriate clinical staff.
The first psychiatric emergency room on the south side of Hampton Roads, the effort was partially funded by a competitive $3.7 million state grant and is part of a larger psychiatric emergency program from the hospital.
The ER will start accepting patients in the next few weeks, once the finishing touches are complete. For those who can’t be treated and immediately released in the ER, the hospital plans to open an additional inpatient facility with 20 beds early next year.
The emergency department should reduce the need for police officers to monitor patients, said Chesapeake Police Chief Mark Solesky.
He said it’s not unusual for six or seven police cruisers to be parked at the hospital on any given night, with officers each tending to a different patient. The new ER will require just one officer.
Solesky said the facility “is going to go a long way towards freeing up our officers to go back out to their core services.”

(Photo by Paul Mansfield Photography/ Getty Images)Maine is trying again to catch up with its regional peers by introducing legislation to prioritize donating and recycling food waste, rather than throwing it away. 
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee is holding a public hearing Wednesday morning for a bipartisan bill from Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) that could help address Maine’s mounting trash problem and greenhouse gas emissions by diverting food waste from landfills. Commonly called a food waste ban, Maine attempted similar legislation last session, but it died due to lack of funding. 
Thanks to a first-of-its-kind study in 2024, there is concrete data showing that more than 360,000 tons of food is wasted or lost in Maine annually. While much of that could be recovered to feed the one in eight Mainers who face hunger, it instead rots in landfills creating methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. 
LD 1065 would prohibit significant generators of food waste, which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others, from disposing of food waste if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste. Like the proposal last session, the bill outlines a gradual approach to expand the requirement based on someone’s location and the amount of waste generated.
If adopted, LD 1065 would initially cover entities that produce an annual average of two or more tons of food waste per week and are located within 20 miles of an organics recycler, starting July 1, 2027. In 2029, those parameters would be reduced to one or more tons per week and within 25 miles of an available recycling facility. 
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection opposed the proposal last session, saying it would require additional staff to help people understand if they are subject to the ban and how to comply. Additionally, the department argued that the state lacks the infrastructure for food waste collection, processing and composting for the ban to be effective.
Brenner’s proposal does not yet have a cost estimate, but the previous bill was estimated to cost upwards of $550,000 for five staff positions and other associated costs for the department. 
Currently, Maine is the only New England state without some version of a food waste ban. Advocates argue that adopting such a prohibition not only offers social and environmental benefits, but is crucial to achieve Maine’s goal of cutting food loss and waste in half by 2030, as outlined in the state’s most recent climate action plan.
Connecticut was the first New England state to pass a food waste law back in 2011. Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island followed suit in the years after, and New Hampshire joined them in 2023.

,Maryland Matters,2025-04-16 09:04:45+00:00,Maryland Matters,Study: Marylanders could save hundreds on electric bills if grid undergoes reform,Christine Condon,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/16/pjm-grid-reform-study/,"Maryland ratepayers could save hundreds of dollars a year on their electric bills if the regional power grid operator could speed up approval of energy projects, some of which have languished for five years in the current system.","Contractors complete work on a transmission line ina 2024 file photo from Puerto Rico. (Photo by Dave Palmer/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)Maryland ratepayers could save hundreds of dollars a year on their electric bills if the regional power grid operator could speed up approval of energy projects, some of which have languished for five years in the current system.
That is main finding of a new report on PJM Interconnection, the grid operator that distributes power in Maryland, the District of Columbia and 12 other states, stretching from the mid-Atlantic to parts of Illinois.
The report, released Tuesday by a national environmental nonprofit,  predicts that Maryland households could see an average of $546 in annual savings on their electric bills from 2025 to 2040, with savings peaking at$1,006 a year in 2036 over current practices. The report, by Massachusetts-based research and consulting firm Synapse, predicts that bills across PJM will grow by 60% between now and 2036 with no change in policies; with the changes, bills would actually decrease by 7% in that period.
“Folks probably don’t know much about PJM or what this organization is doing behind the scenes, but it’s about to hit their pocketbooks,” said Charles Harper, senior policy lead for the power sector at Evergreen Collaborative, the environmental nonprofit that commissioned the report.
“So, we wanted to look at what PJM has done to contribute to this problem, by not adding new energy projects efficiently to the electric grid, and to really look forward and look proactively at what reforms we could do now,” he said.
It’s not just PJM. Harper said grid operators around the country are feeling the pinch of a “new paradigm.”
“Historically, maybe a few large power plants would be in the queue and would need to be studied. But now, a hundred smaller solar, wind and storage projects are in the queue instead,” Harper said.
As demand for AI rises, so do power-thirsty data centers

The slow pace of approvals is no longer suitable in a world where the demand for energy is soaring, driven by data centers that require massive amounts of power, including those in Northern Virginia, a data center hotbed. Between 2025 and 2040, energy load growth is expected to increase by 72%, and data centers will account for the majority of that increase.
“That status quo of approving projects slowly is no longer tenable, because it’s starting to lead to massive cost increases,” Harper said.
But studies have shown that PJM is particularly slow. A February 2024 scorecard from GridLab handed PJM a grade of D-minus, worst of the seven grid operators studied. Tuesday’s study indicated that PJM has had 64 energy projects, which together account for 5 gigawatts of production, in its queue since 2020 or earlier. PJM’s board has estimated that the region could face capacity shortages as soon as the 2026-2027 delivery year.
The report comes as Maryland customers are bracing for increases as high  as $18 a month in their residential electric bills this summer, depending on their utility, according to another Synapse study, this time commissioned by the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel. The increases are the result of a record-breaking electricity auction last summer by PJM, that set prices for power beginning June 1, 2025.
Maryland lawmakers, spurred by complaints of already rising utility bills, approved sweeping energy reform legislation in the just-ended General Assembly session, which included redirecting an energy efficiency fund into refunds for Maryland ratepayers in fiscal 2026. Those refunds are expected to average about $80 per household.
The main goal of the legislation, which is awaiting Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) signature, was to expedite state-level approvals for new power facilities, for everything from nuclear and solar to natural gas and battery storage. Even then, however, Maryland is still beholden to PJM, which must assess every utility-scale energy project before it can come onto the grid, determining whether transmission upgrades are needed to accommodate new projects, from solar arrays to wind turbines and battery storage.
Maryland Energy Secretary Paul Pinsky said during a virtual news conference Tuesday that PJM is “one of the largest obstacles,” to achieving Maryland’s clean-energy goals and lower customer bills.
“For too long, PJM has caved to the interests of fossil fuel generators and utilities that profit from high electricity prices and scarce new generation,” Pinsky said. “That’s, in my opinion, why PJM has slow-walked reforms that would lower prices.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pinsky said he does not believe Maryland should leave PJM, but called on the member states to pressure the grid operator to speed up interconnection.
In a statement, PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields said the grid operator began “significant interconnection process reform in July 2023” that has already trimmed the backlog, with additional approvals coming soon.
“In 15 months, PJM relieved the interconnection backlog by 60% and placed more than 6 [gigawatts] of new generation into service,” Shields wrote.
Shields added that the “significantly higher prices in PJM’s last capacity auction confirmed concerns that we had been calling out over the past two years — that the supply/demand balance has been tightening.”
PJM’s reforms included streamlining “Surplus Interconnection Service,” allowing new energy projects to come online at points where the facility does not run continuously — battery storage beside a renewable energy project, for example. PJM also got approval to start a “Reliability Resource Initiative,” fast-tracking up to 50 “shovel-ready” projects.
But critics, including Pinsky, argue that the criteria for the initiative favor natural gas, rather than renewable energy projects.
“PJM promotes their Reliability Resource Initiative, which fast-tracked projects like gas plants. Many projects in the queue are solar paired with storage. Why aren’t these fast-tracked?” Pinsky asked.
Tuesday’s study called on PJM to embrace additional reforms, including a requirement from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that grid operators complete new-project reviews in 150 days. PJM pushed back against that requirement in a filing with the FERC. The study also said PJM needs to update its understanding of battery storage from its current outsated assumption that “energy storage will charge during peak and require associated transmission upgrades.”
The Evergreen report’s best-case modeling included some items that PJM said it is already pursuing, such as a “first-ready, first-served” process that prioritizes approval for projects that could be operational sooner, as well as a clustered approach, where projects can be considered as a group, rather than one-by-one.
The study predicts that carbon dioxide emissions would fall 14% if PJM completes the reforms, which it assumes would lead to an increase in renewable energy generation — even though it concedes that the reforms could lead to approval of new gas-fired power plants.
Lawmakers approve energy reform bills aimed at cutting rates, boosting in-state generation

“We are not hiding those results, even though we think that better options are available for people and the climate — and for ratepayers,” Harper said.
The biggest beneficiary of the reforms would be battery storage, which the report’s computer model predicted would increase by 59 gigawatts compared to the status quo scenario. But new gas combined-cycle units came in second with 25 gigawatts, and onshore wind took third place with 8 gigawatts.
After a recent appeal led by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), and backed by Moore, PJM has pledged to lower the cap set for the next two annual auctions, thereby lowering rates for customers.
PJM has also made a change regarding Maryland coal plants.
Talen Energy had planned to close two Maryland coal-fired plants, Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, but PJM required them to keep running to meet electricity demand, under arrangement, known as a “reliability must run” agreement. Those plants will continue operating past their June 1, 2025, closure dates, with Baltimore Gas & Electric ratepayers footing the bill.
But the energy to be provided by the two plants was not accounted for in PJM’s record-breaking energy auction last summer, raising prices further. In effect, BGE customers are paying for Brandon Shores and Wagner twice: once because of the auction and again because they will pay the plants to run.
After pushback surrounding the auction, PJM said it will include RMR agreements in future auction calculatiohs. Had Brandon Shores and Wagner been included, BGE customers would see a $5.50 per month increase starting in June — rather than a $16 monthly increase, on average.
In a filing Monday, the Office of People’s Counsel asked FERC to give BGE ratepayers a reprieve — or give them a refund if a ruling comes after June.
“PJM ran a flawed auction resulting in prices that—unless corrected—will cost Maryland residential electric customers hundreds of dollars per year in unreasonable and unnecessary capacity costs,” Maryland People’s Counsel David S. Lapp said in a statement. “We are asking FERC to undo those unjust results.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/4277383-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:59:13.397100

It’s been almost six months since state Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin narrowly lost last year’s election to incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Two recounts confirmed the result.


Unfortunately, Griffin’s effort to overturn the election based on the farfetched theory that thousands of registered voters should have their ballots thrown out continues.


And last week, four Republican state Supreme Court justices endorsed the scheme — ruling that the votes of numerous military and overseas voters will be trashed unless they can somehow provide a photo ID in short order. This despite the fact that state rules required no such thing at the time of the election.
It’s a remarkably dangerous ruling that Republican Justice Richard Dietz blasted as an invitation to losing candidates of all kinds to engage in post-election meddling.


The bottom line: If there’s any fairness left in the world, Justice Riggs will prevail in her appeal to the federal courts. But even if she does, the damage done to the legitimacy of our judiciary and our democracy by the Supreme Court ruling will be immense and long-lasting.

Photo by Dr. Gwendolyn Unzicker.OTTAWA COUNTY — After a yearlong legal battle with a far-right county commission, Ottawa County’s administrative health officer has been recognized with a statewide award for her dedication to defending the role.
Adeline Hambley was awarded the 2025 Jean Chabut Health Policy Champion award in Lansing on April 9 from the Michigan Public Health Week Partnership as part of Public Health Week in Michigan.
The award recognizes individuals or organizations for significant contributions to the health and well-being of Michigan citizens in the policy arena at local and/or state levels that strengthens public health.
“I didn’t know anything about it, so they told me that I was awarded it. That was pretty cool,” Hambley said.
The award comes after Hambley successfully fought off attempts by the county’s former far-right majority, known as Ottawa Impact, to remove her from her position.
In January 2023, the far-right Ottawa Impact controlling majority on the board of commissioners attempted to demote, then fire Hambley in favor of a candidate who had no prior experience in public health.
Hambley sued the board and the county in February 2023, claiming the board overstepped its legal authority and that health officers had certain inalienable rights afforded under state law. What followed was two years of unprecedented strain between the board and the county’s health department.
In April 2023, a circuit court judge granted Hambley a preliminary injunction, allowing her to remain in her role until a trial could take place. However, the Michigan Court of Appeals partially vacated that injunction, saying the board had the legal right to fire Hambley as long as state law was followed.
Throughout summer 2023, the board, then-administrator John Gibbs and Hambley battled over a proposed budget for the department. In the end, the OI majority voted to cut $4 million from the health department’s budget and left its rainy day funded nearly depleted.
The board then held a termination hearing in October 2023, which led to an infamous Nov. 6 meeting where the board voted 7-3 to settle with Hambley for $4 million in exchange for her resignation — although OI commissioners soon attempted to walk back the agreement, claiming a deal hadn’t been reached.
In January 2024, a Muskegon County judge found that, although an agreement was discussed, the board’s vote wasn’t clearly worded enough to be legally binding.
Ultimately, the parties settled in February 2024, with Hambley remaining in her role and the county paying her legal fees.
Hambley said she is grateful for the support she received over the past two years.
“The community as a whole has been really supportive, and that has been great … because I can’t imagine doing this for this length of time — people that were constantly outside picketing and sending death threats and hating you,” she said. “I mean, I still would have done it, but certainly having the community backing makes it and the support of staff makes it so much better. So it was nice to see it on a statewide level.”
She said she wants people to look at her story as one of inspiration
“If nothing else, I think it helps to maybe set the tone for other health officers in the state that our positions are important, they are legally protected, and that they should stand up and protect the role and their community. So I’m hopeful that perhaps others will see that importance,” she said.
She said it’s unfortunate that public health has become a political football in the context of the current political climate.
“Some people say it’s lawfare, or it’s politics, and it’s, like, ‘No, man. I didn’t make public health political. Just because they’re using it as a political tool doesn’t mean my defending the laws that govern the work makes it political in nature,’” she said. “It’s really frustrating. But they’re never gonna feel differently, so, oh well.”

Hambley said public health can be taken for granted when it’s working successfully, which has led to a scenario where everyday citizens might not realize all the benefits and advancements that have resulted from its various services and programs.
“I feel like the success of public health has made people blind to the importance of public health to the community,” she said. “We don’t want to go back to the days of people dying of dysentery and typhoid and tetanus.”
Hambley said conversations at the Lansing conference included health officers asking what they can do to help get the word out on why public health is so critical to healthy communities.
“And I spoke up and said that I think that it is being champions of public health in your community. We are the closest to the community where the boots are on the ground — we are the community; we live here,” she said. “That’s why we have those legal protections in place — so we can make, sometimes, those uncomfortable decisions to protect everybody, including the most vulnerable.”
“And that’s how you’re going to have people even know what we do, what public health is … by being that person that stands up. Also, it gets buy-in for what we do, and people see value in it, rather than rely on the rhetoric of lazy bureaucrats.”
Hambley said showing up and standing tall sometimes includes making unpopular decisions, particularly when it comes to infectious disease mitigation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Really reinforcing that public servant aspect — we are here to serve the community, but that may not please everybody, because it’s to protect the most vulnerable as well, but you have to stand in that space,” she said. “You have to be willing to be uncomfortable and there’s going to be members in the community you’re never going to win over, but there’s going to be a whole lot that see that for what it is.”
The Jean Chabut Health Policy Champion award recognizes individuals or organizations that have made significant contributions in the policy arena to strengthen public health. In 2015, this award was renamed in memory of Jean Chabut, who served as deputy director of Public Health at the Michigan Department of Community Health from 2003 to 2012. From her beginnings as a public health nurse in Detroit, through her transition to public health administrator, until her death in 2014, Chabut was a tireless advocate who fought for improved health for Michigan’s most vulnerable citizens.
Prior to becoming the department’s chief executive, Hambley served as environmental health manager from 2011 to 2022. She has held various local, state and national leadership positions. She holds a master of business administration degree and a bachelor of science degree from Grand Valley State University.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed two bills last week that will change laws surrounding political communications and advertisements in North Dakota.
House Bill 1167, sponsored by Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton, would require a disclaimer in capital letters on any political communication or political advertisement created wholly or in part by artificial intelligence tools.
The bill would include advertisements and communications involving political candidates, political committees, political parties and initiated ballot committees or petitions.
“With capital letters, (House Bill) 1167 is a step forward in setting perimeters for the use of AI within political communications,” said Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo. 
The House unanimously passed the bill in February. The Senate unanimously passed the bill in March.
Another bill signed by Armstrong, House Bill 1204, expands state law against publishing knowingly false political advertisements.
If a person “knowingly, or with reckless disregard for its truth” publishes an “untrue, deceptive or misleading” political advertisement or news release, they could be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, according to the bill.
Fedorchak claims ‘election interference’ over false text messages

The bill expands the types of media covered under the law to include text messages, phone calls and social media posts, in addition to radio, television, newspapers, pamphlets and billboards, among others.
The bill was amended on the floor of the Senate by Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, former campaign manager for North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak.
On the day of the 2024 primary election, anonymous text messages were sent to North Dakota voters saying Fedorchak had dropped out of the race, which she did not. 
“Knowingly spreading falsehoods about an opponent undermines the integrity of our elections,” Cleary said.
On the House floor, Rep. Colette Brown, D-Warwick, said, in today’s political climate, misinformation can spread faster than ever before.
“Whether on social media, television or traditional campaign materials, this bill ensures that when someone deliberately publishes falsehoods about a candidate, a ballot measure, or any election-related issue, they can be held responsible,” Brown said.
The bill passed the House unanimously in February and the Senate on a 45-1 vote in March.
The new laws will take effect Aug. 1.

(Getty Images)To Nancy Biederman, proper teaching is about staying on the right side of the line. On one side are the topics and behavior appropriate for students; on the other, subject material that is overly personal, political, social, or religious. 
Teachers should remain on the first side, Biederman believes. The second should be the sole domain of a student’s parents. And lawmakers should establish legislative safeguards to make sure the line is respected. 
“Teachers are just stepping over the line and trying to become the parents of the children,” said Biederman, a New Boston resident and former elementary and middle school teacher, in an interview. “And that’s not their job.” 
That sentiment has driven a raft of school-related Republican legislation, such as the parental bill of rights, which passed the House, 212-161, in March. It’s also inspired a less prominent bill.
House Bill 235 would update the state’s educator code of conduct to require that teachers pledge a responsibility to parents — not just students. Teachers found by the State Board of Education to have failed that responsibility could face disciplinary sanctions. 
Some, like Biederman, a strong advocate for the parental bill of rights, have cheered HB 235. “I think it would definitely make teachers stop and think for a second before they discuss certain topics,” said Biederman. “And I think it would put that line in the sand that seems to have disappeared, of where they are allowed to discuss and give opinions … on certain topics.” 
But the move has drawn fierce criticism from teachers, who say they already do maintain productive relationships with parents but that legislating those relationships would constrain their ability to do their job.
“I just think you could be abused,” said Mary Ann Cadwallader, a Hanover resident and former teacher, in an interview Tuesday. 
Under current law, the educator code of conduct requires that teachers and other educators maintain four responsibilities: to the education profession and educational professionals; to students; to the school community; and to the “responsible and ethical use of technology as it relates to students, schools, and other educational professionals.”
HB 235 would simply add the phrase “and parents” to educators’ responsibility to students. Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, said it would solidify what should already be part of a teacher’s job.
“Parents are involved in your schools,” Ladd, a former school administrator, said. “… It’s important that we recognize, and I think by recognize in this code of ethics that parents or guardians need to be there.”
The legislation comes as increasing parental involvement in schools has been a top priority for conservatives, amid accusations that teachers are usurping the role of families. House Bill 10, the parental bill of rights, would enumerate a number of rights of parents with respect to their school districts, including the right to direct their child’s education or care, make health care decisions for their child, review school records, consent to any medical tests, and consent to any video recordings of their child. It would also obligate teachers and administrators to communicate and review curriculum with parents, 
HB 235 is a much simpler bill. But teachers’ unions have warned it could still have a broad and negative impact in the classroom.
“There’s a lot put on educators when it comes to all sorts of rules, regulations that you need to follow,” said Brian Hawkins, director of government relations for the National Education Association of New Hampshire, at a hearing on the bill in the House Education Policy and Administration Committee. “And they just want to go in there and teach and educate.” 
Hawkins added there is “no doubt” that partnerships between parents and teachers are important. But he said that complex issues and demands from parents are often better handled by school administrators, not individual teachers.
If passed by the Senate and signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, it is not yet clear how HB 235 would be implemented. The bill itself is short; the exact requirements put into the educator code of conduct would be fleshed out by the State Board of Education and the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules after the bill’s passage. Hawkins warned lawmakers that because the term “responsibility” is not defined, the bill could give broad leeway to JLCAR to add expansive requirements for teachers. 
In written testimony to the House committees, other teachers expressed opposition to the idea of having a formal statutory responsibility to teachers. 
Some said it would be too high a time burden. Others said the bill would eliminate the potential for schools to act as a safe space for children who are struggling internally. 
“I am a professional who treats all of my students with respect,” said Heather Fabbri, of Hampton Falls, who identified herself as a 29-year teacher. “I fear this bill will open doors to parents who have an agenda about who does and does not deserve to feel safe within my classroom.”
Cadwallader hasn’t been teaching since 2001. But she says when she was a teacher, any issues with parents were dealt with head on, without the need for legislative mandates. 
“Public education is very important for everyone and parents certainly have a role in that,” she said. “There’s teacher conferences for parents to talk. A parent who’s really upset with what’s happening can go and talk to the principal in the school.”
To Cadwallader, the current climate can feel oppressive for teachers. 
“I don’t think the general motivation to be a teacher is to stay out of the reach of the law for Pete’s sake. It’s to attend to a child. It’s to be the best teacher you can be, which means you have to get your coursework across to the student.”
But Biederman says teachers can avoid that scrutiny as long as they stay in their professional lane, as she says she and her colleagues did before she retired from the profession 10 years ago. 
“A teacher needs to respect a parent’s right to bring their child up the way they want to bring their child up,” she said. “And how dare you step over that line. As long as the child has their basic needs met, there is no reason for a teacher” to get involved.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/classroomparents-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-16 05:59:13.397100

The attorneys general […[...],"(Stock photo Mint Images/Getty Images)Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost on Monday joined the vast majority of state attorneys general in demanding that Congress make a major change in the business of selling drugs. 
They want to prohibit giant health conglomerates from owning both powerful middlemen and pharmacies that compete with the other pharmacies the middlemen serve. The attorneys general say it’s a setup that gives an unfair advantage to the conglomerates, some of which are among the largest companies in the United States.
In a letter to congressional leaders, they said rapid consolidation and “vertical integration” have raised prices, limited competition, and shut off pharmacy access — especially for the most underserved populations.
In Ohio, the once-obscure middlemen — known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs — have been the subject of controversy for more than seven years. When he was still state auditor, Yost investigated their dealings with state agencies, and since he became AG in 2019, he has sued several.
PBMs represent insurers in drug transactions by creating pharmacy networks, reconciling claims, extracting rebates and fees from drugmakers, and monitoring drug utilization. They say they create savings for insurers and consumers, but the bipartisan attorneys general said that’s not the case.
“PBMs were supposed to help consumers access low-cost pharmaceutical care through negotiated volume-pricing discounts, generic substitution, manufacturer rebates, and other tools,” it says. “While the promise of PBMs was to lower healthcare costs, the reality has been the opposite: Healthcare costs in the United States have skyrocketed. PBMs are using manufacturer rebates to increase, rather than decrease, drug prices. Healthcare costs are higher in the United States than any other developed country in the world, but healthcare outcomes in the United States are not equally extraordinary.”
That last assertion is a big understatement. The Commonwealth Fund last year compared health outcomes in the United States to those in nine other developed countries. Our system is by far the most expensive, yet the outcomes it produced ranked dead last.
A spokesman for CVS Health, one of the conglomerates that owns a big-three PBM, said the attorneys general were just trying to help the big drugmakers with their letter. 
“Earlier this week, 38 attorneys general intentionally chose Big Pharma over people by asking the government for more ways to help drug companies make more money,” the spokesman, Phillip Blando, said in an email.
Spokespeople for the other two conglomerates — UnitedHealth Group and Cigna-Express Scripts — didn’t immediately respond to questions for this story.
Blando said that “CVS Caremark does not set the price of drugs, and rebates do not increase the cost of drugs.” However, academic research and the Federal Trade Commission have both concluded that rising manufacturer rebates to PBMs has resulted in higher costs to consumers.
In their letter, nearly four-fifths of state attorneys general said all three companies are a part of why health care functions so poorly in the United States.
“Over the past few decades, horizontal consolidation and vertical integration have transformed PBMs from useful administrative service providers into market-dominating behemoths that control the industry,” it said. “The three largest PBMs process 80% of the nation’s prescriptions and bring in 70% of the (high-cost) specialty drug revenue. Furthermore, these same PBMs, along with the next-largest three, are vertically integrated both upstream and down.”
That means they own upstream companies such as major insurers that employ them, and doctors’ practices that write prescriptions. And they own downstream companies like the retail and mail-order pharmacies they reimburse for drugs.

The attorneys general said there are inherent conflicts in the arrangements. 
“Each of the top six PBMs (which control 94% of the marketplace) operate their own affiliated pharmacies, while five of the top six are also a part of parent conglomerates that operate insurance companies and health care clinics,” the letter said. “Even now, PBMs continue to devour more of the pharmaceutical industry: three of the top PBMs have recently opened their own manufacturing subsidiaries or entered into ‘co-manufacturing’ agreements with existing manufacturers. This vertical integration allows PBMs and their parent companies to control every step of the prescription manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and dispensing process.”
Because the six biggest PBMs control access to almost all the insured patients in the United States, independent pharmacists and small chains say they have little choice but to accept whatever terms they’re offered to join their networks. Many of those opaque deals include low reimbursements, arbitrary rules and big clawbacks, many have said.
Because contract terms aren’t public — and because PBMs are allowed to own pharmacies — they’re unfairly squeezing their competitors, the attorneys general said.
“This creates the situation where the PBMs — through ownership of affiliated pharmacies — are contracting with and have power over their own pharmacies’ competition,” their letter said. “The PBMs then use their place as middlemen to exert this power in ways that harm independent pharmacies, forcing these small businesses to accept contractual terms that are ‘confusing, unfair, arbitrary, and harmful.'” 
The arrangement creates incentives for PBMs to give their own pharmacies “more favorable contract terms, steer consumers away from independent pharmacies to their own affiliated pharmacies, and otherwise engage in tactics aimed at forcing their competition out of business,” the letter said. “Over the course of the last decade, approximately ten percent of rural independent pharmacies in the United States have closed.”
Blando of CVS said that his company’s PBM’s only goal is to lower costs.
“CVS Caremark represents the only part of the health care industry whose sole aim is to lower costs. Across the country, CVS Pharmacies are the main point of contact for people to get their medicines,” he said. “Together, we work to make medicine more affordable, improve patient care, and deliver better outcomes.”
It wasn’t immediately clear Tuesday how the AGs’ demand would be received by Congress. But several parts of the federal government have shown greater interest in regulating the PBM industry.
Late last year, then President-elect Donald Trump publicly criticized the middlemen. Sweeping reforms were built into a bipartisan deal to keep the government open. 
The reforms were estimated to save the government $1 billion over 10 years. But then billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy tanked the deal by claiming it spent too much. Despite their expected savings, the PBM reforms didn’t make their way into the massive spending plan that passed with Trump’s backing.
Yost is advocating for similar measures in the current Congress.
The Federal Trade Commission has also undertaken a major investigation of the PBM industry, and is suing it over its practices regarding insulin. But the federal antitrust watchdog now is in turmoil as Trump tries to remove the two Democratic-appointed commissioners in disregard of what the 1914 law creating the agency says.
For his part, CVS’s Blando said the if successful, the state AGs will only make American health care more expensive and less effective.
“Hindering our work would make health care more challenging and less affordable, exactly the opposite of what American consumers want,” he said.

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
Black colleges ponder their future as Trump makes cuts to education dollars

The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.











There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher



Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The Baltimore region could get a new trash wheel, one of 21 environmental projects for which Baltimore City is providing funding to compensate for pollution caused by the failure of two city wastewater treatment plants during the pandemic.
The projects, announced Tuesday, will be funded by $1.7 million from the city under a consent decree with the Maryland Department of the Environment. The decree also required millions of dollars in repairs and other improvements to the treatment plants, $1.4 million in penalties and the potential for another $1.4 million of improvement efforts fall short.
The Chesapeake Bay Trust will distribute funding for the projects, which include tree plantings, rain gardens, waterway sampling, trail stabilization and educational efforts around the Baltimore region.
“These projects, they’re going to provide real benefits to those communities that have really faced pollution for way too long,” said Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain during an event Tuesday at Cox’s Point Park, across from the Back River plant. “But they’re not just going to address the damages of the past. They’re actually going to create new opportunities for those communities.”

Baltimore City’s two wastewater treatment plants — the Back River plant in Dundalk and one on the Patapsco River in Wagner’s Point — are the largest in Maryland. And as the COVID-19 pandemic raged, they descended into disrepair.
Advocates at the nonprofit Blue Water Baltimore first flagged high bacteria levels in the Patapsco in 2021, tipping off state environmental inspectors who uncovered mechanical failures and staffing woes that led to overages of pollutants such as bacteria and nutrients, which cause algae blooms that harm marine life.
Months later, with the Back River plant — the larger of the two — on the verge of “catastrophic failure,” then-Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles invoked a rarely used provision in state law to send a team of Maryland Environmental Service experts in to oversee operations at the plant. MDE then filed suit against the city, as did Blue Water Baltimore.
By about June 2022, Back River plant discharges began to meet pollution limits, and the Patapsco plant followed behind. The city paid MES some $7 million for its assistance.
“These plants, as we all know, have faced some real challenges over the past years,” McIlwain said. “But how you respond to those challenges is really what matters. And I am so happy to say today that the city of Baltimore responded. The Maryland Environmental Service responded.”
While the consent decree included the threat of another $1.4 million in penalties if the city failed to comply, the city is “on track” not to owe the extra funds, MDE spokesman Jay Apperson said in a statement Tuesday.
As of its most recent report, in February, the city has spent $167 million on repairs at Back River and another $92 million at Patapsco. The city has also disbursed some $40 million to hire private contractors to augment city staff at the facilities.
The plants are generally compliant with their daily, weekly and monthly pollution discharge limits, but exceedances and spills have led to about $72,000 in additional fines against the city since the consent decree took effect.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D), who turned 41 last week, said Tuesday that the two sewage plants “haven’t had the investment that they needed in my lifetime.” The Back River plant opened in 1911 and the Patapsco plant in 1940.
“We know where we were just a few short years ago, and you can see that we’ve taken leaps and bounds since then,” Scott said. “But this is not us celebrating. This is us acknowledging the great progress that’s been made, and also acknowledging that we have a lot more work to do.”

Community groups who remember when overages at the Back River plant closed the river to swimming just a few years ago remain wary, especially when odors waft around Dundalk and Essex. But Tuesday was still an exciting day, said Desiree Greaver, a project manager at the nonprofit Back River Restoration Committee, which will install the new trash wheel.
“It’s like Christmas,” Greaver said. “This is huge for Back River. It’s going to be so impactful, and the community is really excited.”
Just about every day, the committee sends volunteers to a trash-collecting boom just upstream of the wastewater treatment plant, who don waders and manually remove trash and debris. Once, they caught a hot tub. Another time, port-a-potties.
Even with $655,363 coming from Tuesday’s consent decree, the committee still needs to raise several hundred thousand dollars to make the project a reality, Greaver said. But the nonprofit is optimistic that the project will come to fruition, possibly within 18 months. And once it does, it will make life a lot easier for trash-cleaning volunteers.
“We actually have people getting in the water, physically removing the trash, and we can’t rely on that forever,” Greaver said. “It’s not a glamorous job. It’s not something that’s easy to find help for. So we were really looking forward to something that was automated.”
The new trash wheel will join four others along Baltimore shorelines, best known for their large googly eyes and varying personas.
About $44,000 of the grant money will also go toward a mentoring program administered by One More … One Less, focused on connecting individuals with mental health challenges to water recreation, said Brian Bordley, the group’s CEO.
During Tuesday’s event, Bordley spoke about his own memories fishing with his father near Cox’s Point Park, gaining valuable life experience — even when they didn’t catch anything. By starting his own mentoring program, he hoped to share those same experiences with local kids.
“We gave access to these kids to be on the water, and we saw things change in their behavior,” Bordley said. “Their attitudes became adjusted. Their behavior started to become less hostile and angry. We found that they had a mental health byproduct of just being out on the water.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Serena-McIlwain-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:01:22.469087

Russell Jr., center, with Larry S. Gibson, left, and William H. ""Billy"" Murphy Jr. (Photo courtesy of University of Maryland, Baltimore)George L. Russell Jr., a pioneer in the Black legal community who became the first Black to sit on an appellate court in Maryland, first Black city solicitor and first Black president of the Baltimore City Bar Association, died Saturday at the age of 96.
“He was a giant. He was a pioneer. He was somebody who paved the way for so many Black attorneys in this state,” said Del. Malcolm Ruff (D-Baltimore City), an attorney at the firm Murphy, Flacon & Murphy in Baltimore. “But for George Russell, I wouldn’t have the opportunity that I have today. There wouldn’t be this pathway for the legal practice for Black attorneys.”
Russell’s friends and colleagues said he often supported other Black attorneys.
Larry S. Gibson, a longtime friend and member of the same Black fraternity as Russell, Kappa Alpha Psi, said Russell joined other Black attorneys every Saturday morning “to just shoot the breeze” at Brown, Allen, Watts and Murphy, one of the first Black law firms in Baltimore and the first in the city’s downtown. Russell later became a partner in the firm.
“Those Saturday morning bull sessions really became familiar with George Russell. It began a change in my life,” said Gibson, who graduated with a law degree from Columbia University and was admitted to the bar in 1967. He then began to work for the firm in Baltimore.
One conversation Gibson recalled with Russell was about work ethic.
“George would go to bed between 7:30 to 8 o’clock [p.m.],” he said. “I remember George telling me, ‘You want to impress a client? Call them at 6:30 a.m. and tell them you’re working on their case.’”

Gibson said one of Russell’s major achievements dealt with influencing the community.
In 1982, Russell established Harbor Bank, one of the largest minority-owned banks in the nation. Gibson said Russell also had a major influence on the construction of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture in downtown Baltimore.
He said Russell pushed for Black architects to design the museum. One was Gary Bowden, who taught architecture at the University of Maryland, College Park. The museum will hold iits 20th anniversary gala next month.
“George was determined it was going to be built downtown from the ground up,” said Gibson, who is retiring this month after 50 years of teaching at the University of Maryland Francis Carey School of Law.
Russell was born March 19, 1929. According to The HistoryMakers, a nonprofit research and education institution, Russell’s mother was a homemaker and his father a postal worker.
He graduated from Frederick Douglass High School in 1946, then received a degree in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950 and a law degree at the University of Maryland in 1954.
He was drafted into the Army the same year, working in legal and and in charge of courts, boards and special courts martial.
Russell left his law firm in 1966 after being appointed to become the first African American to serve as associate judge of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore and first to sit on an appellate court in Maryland. A few other firsts included the first Black city solicitor for Baltimore City (1968 to 1974), and the first Black candidate to run for mayor in 1971. He came in second place in the Democratic primary behind eventually winner, William Donald Schaefer.
After city solicitor, Russell returned to private practice in the mid 1970s and became a partner at Russell & Thompson through 1986. During that year, Russell merged his Black firm with a predominantly white firm, Piper and Marbury, one of the top 100 firms in the country.
According to the Maryland archives, Russell became associated with the law offices of the late Peter G. Angelos, the former majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles.
Russell received numerous legal and community awards and served on statewide boards such as the Maryland Museum of African American History and Culture Commission, as chair of the Governor’s Salary Commission and chair of Baltimore’s Judicial Nominating Commission.
“I’m sorry to hear of the passing of Judge George Russell Jr.,” Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), chair of the House Judiciary Committee and assistant state’s attorney in Anne Arundel County, said in a text message Tuesday. “He was a trailblazing jurist, attorney and public servant who made the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland better for all its residents while opening doors to African Americans that were closed for too long.”
Russell is survived by his son, George L. Russell III, who became chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Maryland in May 2024.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Larry-Gibons-George-L.-Russell-Jr.-and-William-H.-Billy-Murphy-Jr-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-04-16 05:01:22.469087

But advocates in Ohio are still preparing their arguments to boost state support as the budget process rolls on.
The Ohio Senate is working toward a draft budget after the House approved its version earlier this month.
As the process continues toward its July 1 deadline, child care advocates hope to get some things into the Senate budget that didn’t appear in the House version. They say they’re important not only for families in need of child care, but also for the state economy and the workforce that supports it.
The House proposal included $200 million for the Child Care Choice Voucher Program over the next two years. The funding comes from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant.
Also included in the House proposal is the establishment of the Child Care Cred Program. It’s a provision originally introduced as Republican-led legislation to split the costs of child care three ways — between the state, the business and the employee — when an eligible individual is employed by a business willing to apply for the program.
Parents and workers involved with child care space met with advocacy group Groundwork Ohio on Tuesday to discuss the current level of child care support. They also discussed how additional state spending would increase child care affordability and access, and boost the wages of child care workers.
Cheryl Rose said when she was a young parent working in food service, child care assistance based on her income helped her remain in the workforce and grow professionally.
Now a partner at Constellation Wealth Advisors, Rose said workforce growth is the one thing that will drive prosperity, and workforce growth is possible through support for child care. That support creates longterm ripple effects that may not appear instantly, but will impact the state’s financial future for years to come, she said.
“What happens is, 18 years from now, there are companies (growing because of an increase in workers), there are more opportunities,” Rose said. “It creates multitudes.”

Improving the lives of child care workers has its own ripple effects, said Christian Davis, founder of the Cincinnati Parent Empowerment Network. With historically low pay, child care workers are often on public assistance and can’t afford food, let alone care for their own children. Bringing wages up and giving workers the ability to thrive boosts the care they can give, she said.
“The quality of your center is really a determinant of the quality of the staff to fill those needs,” Davis said.
Groundwork Ohio wants to see the Child Care Voucher Program receive more funding to address affordability, and the group, among others, will to push for an increase to the eligibility level for the state’s Publicly Funded Child Care.
Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal raised eligibility for care to 160% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four in Ohio, that’s $51,440. But the House left eligibility at 145% in its version of the budget, a level that the head of the Ohio Department of Children and Youth say is the lowest level of support in the country.
The budget also comes at a time when 4 in 10 Ohioans don’t have access because of a lack of child care facilities in their area, according to new analysis by Groundwork Ohio.
The survey also found that, on average, a mom working full-time spends 27% of her median earnings on child care for an infant. It’s worse for moms who are primary earners. Just 32% of Ohio households are headed by women, but they make up 59% of those in poverty, the study found.
The average cost for an infant to be in child care in Ohio is more than $12,000 per year, according to Child Care Aware of America.
Government support of child care enjoys significant public approval. New polling released by the First Five Years Fund, found “strong support” among Republican voters for child care-related tax credits at the federal level.
The recent polling found that 75% of Republicans think the inability to access or afford child care as a “crisis” or a “major problem” for American working families. A majority said expanding child care tax credits would “strengthen the overall economy.”
Of those Republican voters, 83% support increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. It might be on the chopping block as congressional Republicans decide what to include in a funding blueprint approved earlier this month.
The Trump administration is also considering a proposal to eliminate funding for Head Start, a child care program for low-income households.
Head Start is among the programs child care advocates have said should be supported further to improve education outcomes and child care opportunities, rather than be cut.

(Charles Rex Arbogast/The Associated Press)Lawmakers on the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee voted to advance a bill that would modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines.
The committee voted 7-4, along party lines of those present, to recommend the passage of LD 810 with some small changes. 
The legislation is meant to clarify that when the Legislature asks for a new line to be developed, that line should not come back to the Legislature for approval after the review process performed by the Public Utilities Commission.
Democrats who were present for the vote supported the bill from Rep. Chris Kessler (D-South Portland), while Republicans voiced concerns about repealing the rule.
“This is appropriate and good public policy to ensure that we are having at least a lower cost of building transmission in the state and ultimately with the goal of reducing costs for ratepayers but not abdicating our responsibility for a thorough review of these projects,” Kessler said, noting that current statute could lead to developers sinking millions of dollars into a project that could ultimately be voted down by lawmakers. 
‘Not good public policy’: Bill would roll back some provisions of 2021 transmission line referendum

In 2021, Maine voters approved a ballot question to increase legislative oversight on new transmission lines in a campaign that drew passionate grassroots support and over $60 million in opposition spending fueled mostly by international energy companies.
The question was largely seen as a vehicle to stop the controversial 145-mile transmission line through western Maine known as New England Clean Energy Connect. Despite the political and legal hurdles, Central Maine Power’s corridor project is expected to be completed later this year. 
Having worked closely on the 2021 referendum, Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) said the intention was to give the public a way to debate the merits of a line being proposed by an entity other than the Legislature. Given that, she feels LD 810 provides a “really helpful clarification of the intent of the referendum.”
She went on to say that this is an “opportunity to make it crystal clear that a line that’s authorized by the Legislature is different than a line that’s being proposed by a for-profit entity.”
Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said he isn’t comfortable repealing it because, as it stands, the rule allows those who live in the path of these projects and could face eminent domain takings to appear before the Legislature, rather than receive notification by mail.
“It gives us one more chance to debate, discuss and either approve or not said line,” Foster said.
Before casting a vote against, Sen. Matt Harrington (R-York) said he was “highly conflicted” about the bill. While he believes businesses that want to invest large sums of money in Maine should not have to come before “this highly emotional group of people we call the Maine Legislature anymore than possible,” he acknowledged that more often, the general public doesn’t have concerns about such projects until after the route is determined, which normally comes after preemptive legislative approval. 
Before the committee voted, Kessler proposed amending the bill to insert the word “statutory” to clarify that transmission lines proposed by agencies with the statutory authority to do so will be deemed to have the necessary legislative approval. 
The legislative analyst said she could come back to the committee with further language suggestions to better define when an agency has that sort of authority.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Virtually all of the articles that I have written for Kansas Reflector and for other publications have been about agriculture.
That is a byproduct of this Kansas farm boy’s upbringing. The land, and the people who tend to it, are topics close to my heart. That said, these are troubling times, and my heart and mind tell me that this nation, and others, have lost their way. Society is fraying, and at a pace that should be deeply troubling to anyone with a sense of history. That is apparent at the Republican-dominated state legislature in Kansas as well as at the highest levels of the federal government.
Over the past six decades, my career and personal interests have taken me to various corners of the world, and I have dealt with some of the richest of the rich, and the poorest of the poor — from the standpoint of material wealth — during my travels. I have seen some of the worst, and some of the best, of humankind.
I will carry those experiences with me until my dying day.
Experiences give us perspective, and coupled with education, they help us to connect the dots and draw parallels from the past to current events. Civilization is diminished when we ignore the lessons of history and fail to act with respect to people and events that we know are simply not right.
Sometimes an event, or a book, will enable a person to pull together those experiences in a way that is a sort of early warning sign that we have lost our way, in the United States or other parts of the world.
For me, a cathartic moment came from a book that I read recently. It is called Time’s Echo: the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Music of Remembrance. As the author Jeremy Eichler stated, it is about “the role of music … as a witness to history and as a carrier of memory for a post-Holocaust world.”
He notes that World War II caused “a tear in the fabric of humanity, resulting in deep trauma, grief, and scarring.”  And he reminds us that “music remembers us.”
All of this is pertinent to today’s world, and especially in the United States. Most of us know what is right and what is wrong. But the book notes: “The future will not judge us for forgetting, but for remembering all too well and still not acting in accordance with those memories.” As former President Biden mused in his speech at the Democratic convention — what will our legacy be? What will the children say?
One need not be a historian to know that the path undertaken by the current regime lacks a moral compass. Power corrupts, and those who cannot see the parallels between this regime and those in power in the times leading up to World War II are taking us down a path that will not end well.
It is an inflection point in history.
Those of us who recognize the situation have to decide what we do and where we go from here. May we choose wisely and well, and may our example be remembered by generations to come.

Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic Party nominee for vice president, speaks at the Columbus Convention Center as the keynote speaker for the national Network for Public Education conference on Sunday, April 6, 2025. (Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Hands Off! demonstrations at the Ohio Statehouse that drew thousands of protestors wasn’t the only gathering of activists earlier this month in downtown Columbus. 
Just a short distance away at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, a smaller but equally passionate gathering of concerned citizens from across the nation came to Ohio’s capital city to attend the Network for Public Education’s National Conference and affirm their support for the common school, the very symbol of democracy in this increasingly divided nation.
That disunion is driven in part by the rapid growth of universal educational vouchers and charter schools, where public funds flow to private and religious schools as well as privately operated charter schools and where public accountability and oversight of taxpayer funds is limited or even absent. 
In many states, including Ohio, those public funds in the form of vouchers are drawn from the very state budget line item that is earmarked for public schools.
Of particular concern to the conference attendees is the division in communities fueled by vouchers, which have been shown in some states to subsidize private and religious school tuition exceeding 80% of those enrolled. 
In Ohio, according to research conducted by former Ohio lawmaker Stephen Dyer, the figure is 91%. Several speakers referred to this situation as “welfare for the rich” and “an entitlement for the wealthy.” 
The research shared at the conference also confirmed the findings of the National Coalition for Public Education that “most recipients of private school vouchers in universal programs are wealthy families whose children never attended public schools in the first place.”
So much for the tired Republican rhetoric of vouchers being a lifeline of escape from “failing schools” for poor inner-city children.
Another strong area of concern shared at the NPE event was the growing intrusion of religious organizations like Life Wise Academy which recruit students for release time Bible study during the school day. 
While attendees were told that school guidelines direct that such activities are to be scheduled during electives and lunch, the programs still conflict with the normal school routine and put a burden on school resources, where time is needed for separating release time students and adjusting the instructional routine because of the arrival and departure of a group within the classroom.
One presenter, concerned about students receiving conflicting information, said that his experience as a science teacher found situations where there was a disconnect between what he termed “Biblical stories and objective facts.” 
Some Ohio school districts, including Westerville and Worthington in Franklin County, had to amend their policies in the wake of HB 8, which mandated that districts have religious instruction release time policies in place. The district policies had been written as an attempt to lessen the possibility of other religious programs wanting access to students and the further disruption that would cause to the school routine. 
The recent legislative activity about accommodating religious groups like LifeWise is at variance with history, as conference chair and Network for Public Education founder Dr. Diane Ravitch pointed out in her remarks about the founding of Ohio. 
As part of the Northwest Territory, she noted that Ohio was originally divided into sixteen townships, with Township 16, one square mile of the grid, being reserved for school lands. Unlike education, there was no intent to designate any part of the grid for religious purposes, she explained.
Ohio became the first state to be formed from the Northwest Territory, and its provision for public education would become a prototype for the young republic. The common school, an idea central to the founders of the state, would be located such “that local schools would have an income and that the community schoolhouses would be centrally located for all children.”
Unfortunately, the idea of the common school being centrally located in every community is an idea not centrally located within the minds of right-wing Republican legislators. From the information exchanged at the conference, that is the case in the great majority of statehouses, and a matter of great concern for continuing national cohesiveness.
The theme of the NPE National Conference, “Public Schools – Where All Students Are Welcome,” stands in marked contrast with the exclusionary practices of private and religious schools where, unlike public schools, there are no requirements to accept and enroll every student interested in attending. While these schools are reluctant to accept students who may need additional instructional support, they show no reluctance in accepting state voucher payments.
Texas state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, one of the keynote speakers, told the audience about her experience in fighting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s voucher scheme and the double meaning of the term school choice. 
“School choice is also the school’s choice,” she told the audience, as she estimated that 80% or more of state funds will go to kids who are already enrolled in private and religious schools.
Her battle with the Texas governor, who has defined the passage of voucher legislation in the Lone Star State as his “urgent priority,” is a tale of his alliance with Jeff Yass, a pro-voucher Pennsylvania billionaire who has donated $12 million so far to Abbott’s voucher crusade. 
Hinojosa was scathing in her criticism of Abbott and his fellow Republicans and of a party that once “worshipped at the altar of accountability.” Now, she told the attendees, “they want free cash money, with no strings attached.” 
“Grift, graft, and greed” is the narrative of appropriating public funds for private purposes, Hinojosa believes, a tale of supporting “free taxpayer money with no accountability.”
The NPE conference ended with an address by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. 
With his background as a former teacher and coach, Walz had a strong connect with an audience comprised mostly of educators and public school advocates. His folksy language and sense of humor further endeared him to the conference attendees.
Based on the continuing bad behavior of affluent actors in the voucher and charter wars, “greedy bastards” is a better descriptor than oligarchs, he observed. 
From the reaction of the audience and what they heard previously from Gina Hinojosa and other presenters, the language offered by Walz was a more accurate definition of welfare for the wealthy. 
At the end of his remarks, Walz encouraged educators not to despair but to accept their key place in society. “There is a sense that servant leadership comes out of serving in public education.”
Attendees at the NPE conference included educators, school board members, attorneys, legislators, clergy, and policy makers — a cross-section of America. 
Their presence affirmed a core belief that the public school, open to all, represents the very essence of a democratic society. 
And there is no debate about whether or not those schools are under attack by right-wing legislatures intent on rewarding higher-income constituents with tuition support to schools that choose their students as they exercise the “school’s choice.” (As a devotee of the Apostrophe Protection Society, I applaud this distinction.)
So what are we going to do about this? Attendees left the conference with some strong themes.
The choir needs to sing louder.
Hope over fear. Aspiration over despair.
The road to totalitarianism is littered with people who say you’re overreacting.
As the loudness about the subject of what is more aptly described as “the school’s choice” gets louder,” you can bet that servant leaders like Diane Ravitch, Gina Hinojosa, Tim Walz and others are making a difference in responding to the challenge of servant leadership to ensure that the common school, so central to 19th Century communities in the Northwest Territory and beyond, continues to be the choice of every community for defining America and the democracy it represents.

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images.)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.










Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug


“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
Drug decriminalization stumbled in Oregon. Other states are taking note.

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
The Colorado psychedelic mushroom experiment has arrived

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

 Keri Heintzeman,  the director of President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District and the wife of state Rep. Josh Heintzeman, cruised to an easy victory in Tuesday’s Republican primary for the the Senate District 6 special election.
She’ll face Denise Slipy, who ran unopposed for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor nomination.
Candidates are running to replace former state Sen. Justin Eichorn. The special election is April 29; the district comprises Grand Rapids and the Brainerd Lakes region.
In a statement released after her victory, Heintzeman said, “The upcoming election is critical for restoring fiscal responsibility to our state government and ensuring accountability for the significant waste and fraud under the Walz administration.”
In addition to her political work, Heintzeman is helping homeschool the family’s six children.
Minnesota DFL Chair Richard Carlbom praised Slipy in a statement: “As a reserve officer and former volunteer firefighter, Denise Slipy has dedicated herself to serving her community. Denise will fight to protect her constituents’ health care and be a champion for strong public schools because she knows that public service should be about improving people’s lives, not partisan politics.”
Slipy is an environmental health and safety professional and first responder for North Crow Wing County who calls herself a moderate Democrat. She’ll face long odds against Heintzeman in the heavily Republican district; Crow Wing County voted for President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 31 percentage points.
But Democrats have often pulled off surprising special election victories during both of Donald Trump’s presidential terms, boosted by motivated anti-Trump voters and independents who turned against Trump during his first term and appear to be doing so again.
Turnout was modest Tuesday — unofficial returns showed about 7,300 Republicans and 1,200 Democrats cast ballots.
The Reformer profiled the race recently.
Eichorn resigned following his arrest last month on federal charges of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS – Attendees of a Tuesday evening town hall focused on the impact of Trump administration policies voiced worries about federal funding cuts, the impact of tariffs and a lack of communication from elected officials.
The event, the second of four sessions held across South Dakota and led by prominent South Dakota Democrats, took place at Augustana University’s Hamre Recital Hall. 
Nikki Gronli, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development director,  said she wanted to organize the sessions to listen to people and offer resources to those who feel ignored by South Dakota’s congressional delegation as they face fallout from federal funding cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration.
“We know that people are concerned, afraid and have seen impacts in their lives already from grants and loans and things that have been paused,” Gronli said.
Attendees rallied around calls to unseat South Dakota’s U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Sens. Mike Rounds and John Thune, all Republicans. 
‘After all our hard work’: Federal fallout leads to suspension of interlibrary loan courier service

The state’s U.S. senators are in South Dakota this week, but not for town halls. Sen. Rounds spoke to the group Americans for Prosperity on Monday in Rapid City. Thune will be on hand for a ribbon-cutting at an Amazon delivery station in Box Elder Wednesday morning, and speak at a Pennington County Republican Women’s monthly luncheon in Rapid City shortly thereafter. A group called Indivisible Rapid City is planning a silent protest to coincide with the luncheon.
Gronli described the Sioux Falls event as bipartisan, but it was organized by the South Dakota Democratic Party. Many attendees identified themselves as Democrats when they rose to voice their concerns in the packed auditorium. 
Brandon resident Michael Nitz said he changed his party registration from Republican to Independent shortly after President Trump took office this year. There are efficiencies to be found in federal government, he said, but he doesn’t like the approach of the Trump administration or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Tesla founder Elon Musk.
Nitz voiced frustration over a lack of public events with the state’s Congressional delegation.
“You’re the only people who are answering my questions,” Nitz told the speakers, a group that included Gronli, as well as former South Dakota state Sen. Reynold Nesiba and 2026 Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Julian Beaudion. “I fired off emails and phone calls like you’re supposed to do to Rounds, Johnson and Thune. I’ve not gotten any response for that, so I’m getting tired.”
Tim Sundet, from Lake Preston, was visibly angry as he took the microphone and held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution.  He took issue with Homeland Security Secretary Noem’s plan to monitor immigrants’ social media activity for “antisemitism” and college students and faculty across the country being detained for participating in pro-Palestinian protests.
“You have the right to assemble. It is in the Constitution and yet they don’t care. Where are our members of Congress? What are they doing about it?” Sundet said.
Attendees also expressed discontent with Trump’s cabinet picks, including Noem, the former South Dakota governor, spoke of what they see as an uncertain future for Medicaid and other federal programs, and about Trump’s unstable tariff policies. 
Nesiba said tariffs will hurt South Dakota farmers.
Soybeans are China’s top agricultural import from the U.S., totaling $12.8 billion in 2024, according to the USDA. Soybeans are South Dakota’s top agricultural export, valued at $1.6 billion in 2022.
“What I worry about is that this might not be temporary. When a country starts to have relationships with somebody else – that they’re getting their soybeans from Brazil and their beef from Australia – then it’s harder for us to get those markets back,” Nesiba said. “We spent a lot of money building those trade relationships over time, and in a matter of 100 days we’ve burned a lot of goodwill around the world in those relationships.”

Beaudion, Gronli and Nesiba encouraged attendees to engage respectfully with elected officials at all levels, as well as with family members and neighbors supportive of Trump administration policy.
“If we put a lot of pressure on those local officials, then I promise you our state Legislature will hear it because they’ll be pressured,” Beaudion said, “and then our federal officials will hear it because our legislators and the state will be pressured.”
Beaudion also suggested that attendees could run for state and local office.
Gronli said stories collected from the sessions and through online forms will be compiled into a report that’ll be sent to Johnson, Rounds and Thune’s offices.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-16 04:01:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Beyond the birds and bees: Why CT kids need comprehensive sexual education,Sandhya Sanapala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/16/beyond-the-birds-and-bees-why-ct-kids-need-comprehensive-sexual-education/,"We must advocate for laws that mandate medically accurate, inclusive sexual education in Connecticut Schools.","For generations, “the birds and the bees” has been the go-to metaphor for introducing kids to the basics of sex and relationships. But many parents still feel uncomfortable or unsure when it comes to having that conversation, especially given the ever-evolving nature of relationships, sexual health and gender identity. 
As a medical student, I’ve had children ask me: “What is sex?” “What is a healthy relationship?” and some even share personal stories about their gender identity and sexuality. I’ve also had many parents ask me: “When do I bring it up?” “What do I say?” and most commonly and relatable to many, “I wasn’t given the talk by my parents, I got it from school.” 

Sanya Sanapala
So, what do we do about this situation? We must advocate for the requirement of medically accurate sex education curriculum in public schools, as well as education pertaining to gender identity, sexual orientation and consent.
Many schools teach to the abstinence curriculum, which is what I was taught at my school. But is this effective? A study by Stanger-Hall in 2011 looked at 48 states (excluding Wyoming and North Dakota) of which 39 states either covered, emphasized, or stressed abstinence-only education. It was shown that the average teen pregnancy rate increased with an increased level of abstinence education. 
The states that stressed abstinence had an average birth rate of 73.24 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls. The states that covered abstinence education had an average birth rate of 56.36 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls. The issue goes beyond just what we teach about abstinence, it also lies in the gaps within the curriculum in Connecticut.
The Connecticut Department of Education sets guidelines for sex education in public schools, but does not set requirements. Specifically, there is no curriculum requirement to include topics such as gender identity, sexual orientation, or even consent. In addition, Connecticut also has no statute regarding medically accurate sex education instruction. This is particularly concerning to me as a future healthcare provider.
I strongly urge legislation in Connecticut to require medically accurate sex education curriculum. Medically accurate education involves providing information that is up-to-date, scientifically supported, and free from ideological bias. It ensures that students receive the correct facts about sexual health, contraception, and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
Comprehensive education is linked to lower rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV as young people who are informed about prevention are more likely to take protective measures. A 2021 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that comprehensive, medically accurate sex education has been shown to delay sexual initiation, increase contraceptive use and safe sex practices, and reduce the number of sexual partners among adolescents. Governments have an obligation to provide accurate information to their citizens, and that includes students.
Furthermore, legislation should mandate topics such as gender identity, sexual orientation, and consent be included in sexual education curriculum. It is important to promote inclusivity and respect for diversity while fostering a supportive education environment for students. A 2019 survey by the Trevor Project found that nearly half (40%) of LGBTQ+ youth and more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth have seriously considered suicide this past year. With inclusive education, we can validate these students’ identities and improve outcomes. According to a Human Rights Campaign survey in 2018, 94% of LGBTQ+ students who receive inclusion lessons reported feeling safer in school. 
We all want the same thing for our children: to grow up healthy, informed, and capable of making good decisions. Regardless of our personal beliefs or backgrounds, we can agree that in an increasingly complex world, we want our children to have accurate information to navigate it. Providing comprehensive, medically accurate sexual education equips them to make safer choices, respect others, and understand their own health and relationships. By investing in better education, we are investing in their future, creating a society where every student, no matter their identity or background, can thrive and succeed.
But this change won’t happen without action. I urge readers to contact their legislators and advocate for laws that mandate medically accurate, inclusive sexual education in Connecticut Schools. Share this message with your schools, whether that means talking to school boards, writing to local newspapers, or using social media to spread awareness. Or maybe joining organizations like Planned Parenthood or GLSEN which are already making efforts to push for these necessary changes. 
Every voice matters in ensuring that the next generation has access to the knowledge they deserve. Let’s make comprehensive sex education a reality for all students in Connecticut.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThree people were arrested, two of them shocked with a Taser and about six people were escorted out of the building as Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene held a town hall in Acworth Tuesday.

“We aren’t going to be intimidated by funded Democrats that want to come in and scream and yell,” Greene said after the meeting at the Acworth Community Center in Cobb County. “A town hall is information for our constituents, and this is not a political rally, this is not a campaign rally, and town halls are extremely important. I’m glad they got thrown out, that’s exactly what I wanted to see happen.”
The first arrest came just after the town hall began when one man loudly booed Greene and was dragged into the hallway by police and shocked with a Taser at least twice. Shortly after he was taken away, police could be seen scuffling with another man in the crowd, eventually using the Taser on him as well.

According to police, the first man was charged with misdemeanor simple battery on a police officer and misdemeanor obstruction. The second man was charged with misdemeanor simple battery on a police officer and felony obstruction, and the woman was charged with violating a city ordinance on vulgar language, a misdemeanor.
Greene spent the roughly hour-long town hall praising President Donald Trump’s second term, crediting him with lowering border crossings, cutting government waste and seeking a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.
A long-time Trump ally and conservative firebrand, Greene has gone from being banished from House committees a few years ago to now chairing the subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is part of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
A heated political climate
Greene was one of only a handful of Congressional Republicans who planned a town hall during the current two-week recess, which comes about a month after party leadership advised lawmakers to avoid in-person town halls, according to reports.
The north Georgia congresswoman held the town hall in the more left-leaning corner of her otherwise ruby red district. Greene told reporters after the town hall that she had been planning the event since January.
Other Republicans, including Georgia Congressman Rich McCormick, have seen fiery town hall meetings where they have been grilled by peeved voters on issues like Trump’s executive powers and Elon Musk’s DOGE and its cuts to federal programs.

Democrats said the angry interactions are a sign of dissatisfaction with Trump’s new administration. Republicans largely dismissed them as paid protesters or rabble rousers traveling in from out of the district and recommended elected officials host telephone town halls or engage with constituents in other ways meant to minimize public disruptions.
The crowd at Greene’s town hall was mostly friendly, but some constituents could be heard scoffing or otherwise expressing their unhappiness – several interrupted the event by shouting or, in one case, unfurling a sign reading “Jail 4 Inside Traders.”
Alleged insider trading
Greene went into the town hall embroiled in what opponents call an insider trading scandal.
A Congressional report shows Greene bought between $21,000 and $315,000 in stocks on April 8 and 9, the day before and the day that Trump announced a pause on his tariff plan. The tariffs had put the market into a tailspin and the announcement of the pause caused a surge, allowing anyone who bought low to make a tidy profit.
Democrats allege that Greene made the trades with foreknowledge of the pause in violation of insider trading laws. Greene rejects the charges as a partisan smear.
Greene told reporters she had no advanced knowledge of the tariff pause.
“I have a fiduciary agreement with my portfolio manager. I don’t place my buys myself,” she said. “That’s something that my portfolio manager does for me, and he did a great job. Guess what he did? He bought the dip. And that’s what anybody that has any financial sense does when they know the market’s going to be going down. That was obvious to everyone.”
An imperfect screen

Greene’s office made efforts to screen attendees for Tuesday’s meeting, requiring them to fill out a form in advance that included their home address and then show ID at the door to prove their identities. Greene’s staff screened attendees for residency in the district, but one of the men who was arrested carried an ID that placed him outside of it, according to police.
Reporters were told not to interview any attendees, and rather than taking questions from the audience, she answered questions that people had written and submitted when they signed up for the town hall.
Most of the questions were friendly, though a few more hostile queries made their way into the program, including “Why are you such a coward in the face of an obvious fascist takeover?”
Greene laughed off her detractors’ questions and characterized them as misinformed, earning applause from the crowd when she did so.
She told reporters she read pre-screened questions because of eye trouble.

“We always have people write down their questions. The problem is, it’s difficult to read everyone’s handwriting,” she said. “So normally, they write down a question and they put them in a fishbowl for me, and I usually have to put on my reading glasses and read them, but it was much easier to have them type out their questions on the form when they signed up for the town hall.”
Greene’s district is one of the most conservative in the state, stretching from the solidly red northwest corner of the state to include northwest Cobb County, which is part of metro Atlanta. Cobb was once a Republican stronghold but has become much friendlier to Democrats over the years as a younger and more diverse population moves in, particularly in the southern part of the county.
Over 100 protesters were gathered outside as Greene spoke – at times, their chants or the honks of passing cars could be heard during the town hall.
Among the crowd was Clarence Blalock, a Democrat who plans to run against Greene when she is up for reelection in 2026.

Blalock said Democrats in the district feel like Greene likes to make a big show but doesn’t listen to their needs.
“She screens her questions, she screens her people, everything is pre-screened, so this is not a real town hall,” he said. “If you can pick your questions beforehand, and your people, and you make sure they’re Republicans – and even to contact her, you’ve got to put in your ZIP+4, which is not necessary at all. She has no representation in the district.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska legislators confront a major state budget deficit, the state Senate on Tuesday voted unanimously to approve a “bare bones” $162 million capital budget to pay for construction and renovation projects across the state.
The spending plan, which would take effect July 1, remains a draft subject to approval by the House. Gov. Mike Dunleavy may also make line-item vetoes.
The budget bill passed by the Senate is almost entirely limited to the minimum needed to unlock more than $2.5 billion in federal grants for road maintenance and other priorities.
With oil revenue down and costs up — including the Permanent Fund dividend — analysts are projecting a significant budget deficit for the coming year. On Friday, the House voted to reduce the proposed 2025 dividend, but not enough to erase the deficit.
To help the issue, members of the Senate Finance Committee clawed back millions of dollars previously allocated to construction projects, reducing the need for new state revenue to pay for the capital budget.
Among the clawbacks: $37 million set aside for the Juneau Access Project, an effort to improve road and ferry service to the capital city.
“To even get to the bare-bones capital budget, my district ended up contributing half a dozen ribs and a femur. … I’m not pleased,” said Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau and a member of the Senate Finance Committee.
Other notable clawbacks included $10 million for a proposed deep-draft port in Nome, and $138,611 remaining in an account to be used for Ketchikan’s proposed Gravina Island Bridge, once dubbed the “bridge to nowhere.”
Members of the finance committee also turned to the state-owned investment bank, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, for an additional $12.5 million above the $20 million already pledged by the bank to the state treasury. 
Budgeters rejected some of Dunleavy’s budget requests: $2.5 million for a proposed road in the western portion of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, $4.2 million for development of the trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, $2.5 million for firefighting aircraft, and $6.5 million for a new state plane to be used for emergency response.
They also rejected all $3.2 billion in requests from individual legislators for their specific districts.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, called the result “a fair and balanced approach” in a statement released after the vote.
Some projects saw reduced funding: A $6.5 million request to expand the Bradley Lake hydroelectric project’s capacity was cut to $6 million. Bradley Lake is among the cheapest sources of electricity on the Railbelt. 
The Senate’s biggest addition was $19 million for major maintenance at public schools — the governor had proposed no funding for the major maintenance list.
“This is just the beginning of many tough decisions you’re going to see over the next few weeks, between now and the end of May, and I don’t think some of the folks in the building have quite grasped that yet,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee in charge of the capital budget.

Petitions must be submitted to the Arkansas Secretary of State's office by Friday. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ attorney general on Tuesday rejected for a second time a proposed ballot measure to amend the state’s initiative and referendum process. 
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin noted in an opinion prepared by Senior Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside that while proponents had resolved several issues preventing certification of the initial proposal, one issue remained and others were created. 
Little Rock attorney David Couch submitted the revised proposed constitutional amendment on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Arkansas on March 31. State law requires the attorney general to approve or reject a proposed ballot measure within 10 business days, and Tuesday was the deadline.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas expressed disappointment in Griffin’s decision in an emailed statement and reiterated its commitment to submitting a revised proposal.
“Protecting the people’s right to propose and vote on laws is foundational to a healthy democracy,” LWV Arkansas President Bonnie Miller said. “This amendment is necessary to protect and safeguard our constitutional right to direct democracy. We are not giving up.”
Among other things, the initial proposal sought to change the attorney general’s role in reviewing ballot titles, but the language of the proposed ballot measure ensured there would be times the AG would be unable to act, Griffin wrote. 
In an attempt to remedy the issue, the LWV Arkansas made a few edits to its proposal, including one that would require that the attorney general must only certify that the popular name is not misleading, rather than certify that both the popular name and ballot title are not misleading. This still did not resolve the problem, Griffin wrote. 
“Your current submission runs into the same problem as your previous submission: it again misleadingly suggests that the Attorney General will always approve some version of a submitted ballot title, while creating a system that ensures the Attorney General will at times be unable to certify a ballot title,” the opinion states. 
Griffin’s Tuesday opinion also noted issues with consistency with terms in sections of the state Constitution, as well as grammatical issues.
There is no limit to how many times a group may submit a proposed ballot measure. The attorney general’s office has already certified three other ballot title proposals that address education, government transparency and taxes on feminine hygiene products for the 2026 election cycle.
The Legislature can also refer up to three constitutional amendments as ballot measures for 2026. It had not finalized its decisions as of Tuesday.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)I strongly oppose the change to Alaska’s Constitution to allow spending from a proposed single-component Permanent Fund. 
Today, the Permanent Fund has two components, its principal account and earnings reserve account. The principal is nonspendable and, accordingly, is the “permanent” part of the Permanent Fund. The ERA is, at present, the only component that money can be spent from. 
The fund’s website says its “goal should be to maintain safety of principal.”  
Merriam-Webster defines the word permanent as “stable: continuing or enduring without fundamental or marked change.” The Permanent Fund exists because Alaska’s Constitution was designed to prohibit spending the principal. Don’t change Alaska’s Constitution. 
Political impulses within Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. want to change Alaska’s Constitution by eliminating the ERA. That proposal creates a single-component fund from which withdrawals are taken. In doing that, real risks emerge to maintaining the safety of the principal.
In 2017, Alaska created the percent-of-market-value distribution, and set the current withdrawal rate at 5% of the fund’s total market value. The 5% distribution from the ERA is now approximately $3.7 billion to $4 billion per year for roads, airports, troopers, schools, etc.  
The theory driving a possible constitutional change is a nearly 50% chance that the 5% distribution will, within a decade, fully deplete the ERA, leaving only the nonspendable principal. A fully depleted ERA immediately crushes the operation of government. But, the answer is not to make the principal spendable. 
The proposed constitutional change converts the current two-component system to a single-component system. The 5% distribution would be withdrawn from this single-component system. Because the principal becomes spendable, the Permanent Fund could be spent down to nothing. The word “permanent” is gone. Risks to maintaining the safety of the principal arise. 
Consider this question: If the 5% withdrawal rate for the current POMV is a factor in fully depleting the ERA, isn’t it obvious that, if constitutional protection of the principal is removed, a 5% withdrawal rate from a single-component Permanent Fund can — and will — deplete the principal?  The answer is, “Yes, of course.” Removing constitutional protection of the principal destroys the safety of the principal. Permanent becomes impermanent. 
It is important to understand how Alaska got here and the magnitude of money spent from savings from 2013 to now. For the fiscal years 2014-2018, the state average deficit was about $3 billion per year; deficits resulted in spending about $18 billion from Alaska’s Statutory Budget Reserve and Constitutional Budget Reserve accounts to pay the bills. After substantial depletion of those accounts, the percent-of-market-value distributionwas needed. So, the spendable ERA was accessed. The ERA was the next pot of money to deplete. About $3.5 billion-plus per year was then withdrawn from the ERA; the total spending from ERA savings is more than $20 billion. Money forever gone.   
The constitutional proposal intends to change the nonspendable principal to spendable — so it can next be spent.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again while expecting a different result. Alaska has already spent about $18 billion from Alaska’s Statutory Budget Reserve and Constitutional Budget Reserve accounts. Then the 5% withdrawal rate reduced the ERA by billions per year. The ERA may be fully depleted within the decade.  
If we change the constitution to allow the same 5% withdrawal rate upon a single-component Permanent Fund, we are insane to expect a different result other than eventual depletion of the principal. A 5% withdrawal rate eventually depletes the Permanent Fund. 
History shows the actual risk of complete depletion of the principal. This is not fantasy. Over $40 billion from previous savings is forever gone.  
And please do not talk about the Willow project and other projects in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska providing billions for Alaska’s budgets. NPR-A is federal land which means Alaska gets 0% royalty. Plus, under Alaska’s current production tax system, Alaska only receives about 4% of the gross value of oil’s price from federal and state land. And, due to political forces, NPR-A development expenses are deducted from Alaska-owned Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields, costing Alaska hundreds of millions in revenue each year. 
Of course, the push to change Alaska’s Constitution — to spend the Permanent Fund principal until it too is depleted — avoids the reality that a serious look into revenue sources can no longer be ignored. 
I oppose any change to Alaska’s Constitution which allows spending the Permanent Fund principal. The word “permanent” must remain substantive and real. Remove constitutional nonspendable protection of the principal and eventually all of it will be spent.  
I oppose removing constitutional protection of the principal.

DeAnn Vaught addresses the House regarding SB290 on April 15, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House passed a bill Tuesday that would maintain a permit moratorium for hog farms in the Buffalo River watershed, while setting out a process for future watershed-based bans to be considered by lawmakers. 
Senate Bill 290 now nears the end of a long-running legislative process that began at the beginning of the session, spanning multiple amendments, before finally passing the Senate earlier this month.
The Senate will need to concur in the amendment introduced last week before SB 290 is sent to the governor’s desk.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders previously released statements saying she didn’t support any legislation that did not protect the Buffalo — a key tourism driver — but pivoted to support it last week after it was amended again.
Bill amended to protect existing Buffalo River watershed moratorium

During remarks on the House floor, Horatio Republican Rep. DeAnn Vaught, the House sponsor, apologized to her fellow members for the number of constituent communications they had received regarding the bill. 
She said that the issue of the moratoriums had become “political,” instead of being based in science. Vaught added that she did not believe the original versions of the bill, which would have removed or made it easier to remove existing moratoriums, would have hurt the Buffalo River.
“Some of you asked why we didn’t exclude the Buffalo River and Lake Maumelle to begin with. My answer is because the moratorium that was put on … the Buffalo River actually made the farmer look like he had done something wrong, when science had proven he had done nothing wrong,” Vaught said.
She said the final version of SB 290 would give legislators a seat at the table for any future moratorium, adding that lawmakers had been forced out of the decision when it was made a decade ago.
“We lost a voice in the earlier fights with the Buffalo River watershed. Our voice was taken from us,” Vaught said of legislators having a say in permit moratoriums. 
She added: “Farmers work hard, they are conservationists; they are environmentalists.”
The Department of Energy and Environment and the Department of Agriculture — both of which are in charge of administrative rules that currently contain the moratorium — support the bill with the latest amendments. 
Shane Khoury, the Energy and Environment secretary, said last week that the amended bill would allow it to continue protecting the Buffalo River watershed, while addressing concerns raised by Vaught regarding farmers who were already in the watershed.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The Forward Party, a political party whose members say they want a return to civility in politics and improvements to U.S. democracy, announced Tuesday it is seeking 3,500 signatures to secure minor party status in New Mexico.
The New Mexico chapter’s launch comes after what members tout as a major success a decade in the making: A new state law allowing unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in primary elections here. 
Bob Perls, New Mexico Forward Party chair and a former state representative, championed that effort since 2015. He told a small group gathered at a historic church in Corrales on Tuesday afternoon that a major focus of the Forward Party in New Mexico will be those types of democratic improvements, like taking on unfairness in the redistricting process, campaign finance reform, and empowering more people to vote in races where there are meaningful choices on the ballot. 
“If you look at what is the root cause of hyper-partisanship and political polarization in this country, you can trace a lot of it to how we elect, district and finance candidates,” Perls said. 
NM House narrowly endorses open primaries for unaffiliated voters

The party hopes to collect enough signatures to endorse and recruit candidates to run in the 2026 midterm elections. It will likely not have enough support or resources to weigh in on the Albuquerque mayoral elections this year, said spokesperson Karin Williams. 
Perls also said the party would target members of both parties who voted to keep New Mexico’s primaries closed and would seek to increase the number of candidates on the ballot across the state. 
In the most recent New Mexico legislative elections, more than one-third of candidates had already won their primaries on the day the primary election was held. That meant that 70% of registered Democrats and 78% of registered Republicans had one or zero House candidates to vote for that day, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
The group hopes that it can tap into what its leaders describe as widespread disenchantment with the two major political parties. As of December 2024, 340,000 New Mexico voters, roughly a quarter of all voters in the state, were not affiliated with any of the state’s three major parties, which are Democrats, Republicans or Libertarians, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. 
And 40% of New Mexico voters aged 18 to 24 are unaffiliated, said Rep. Cristina Parajón (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the open-primary bill, during the House floor debate March 21.
The primary election is today. More than one-third of legislative candidates have already won. 

Andrew Yang, who unsuccessfully ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, founded the Forward Party in 2022. Its leaders now cite a number of “Forwardists,” most recently a Utah state senator who left the Republican Party to join the Forward Party last month. 
Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency secretary during George W. Bush’s presidency, is also a Forward Party leader. She joined Perls on Monday, saying the party is focused heavily on expanding its footprint in local races and statehouses, along with nationally, as part of its strategy to challenge two-party dominance. 
The Forward Party does not have much of a platform, apart from a pledge it requires candidates it supports. The pledge requires candidates to affirm their commitments to the rule of law and the Constitution, data-driven policy-making, and creating “a safe space to discuss controversial issues,” Todd Whitman said. 
“But we recognize that every state is different, and within states, you’re going to have different areas of issues, and that people need that flexibility,” Todd Whitman said. “Candidates need to be able to respond to their constituents.”
Todd Whitman said Forward Party, to her, represents a “centrist” alternative to two parties that have increasingly catered to extreme members of their own parties, though she suggested leaders might not want to market themselves as centrists. 
“That’s what we are, in a vacuum, and that’s what most of the people who are part of Forward are. They’re in the center,” she said. “They want to see the problem solved. They’re not extreme, which makes you in the center, but you have to find the right language.”

Heather Balas, a Democrat who lost her primary race for state Senate in 2024, asked what it would take for a third party to become competitive in New Mexico and across the country. William Scott, another Democrat, spoke up to say he was “hammered by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party,” for being a “centrist, Forward” Democrat. 
He ran unopposed in the primary but lost to Republican Ant Thornton for state Senate District 19. He said he needs more support from the Forward party, in terms of a campaign manager and fundraising, if he were to run again. 
“So I’m just wondering, what is the way forward?” he asked. Perls and Todd Whitman told him to run again, promising more support should he seek a state House seat in an upcoming election and noting that, if the party can get ballot access, he can skip the Democratic primary. 
“I think just bypassing the Democratic primary is going to make a huge difference for your ability to speak your mind and be true to yourself, and represent a far broader cross section of the voters than you would trying to appeal to the party base to get through the Democratic primary,” Perls told him. “Please run.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9453-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 21:00:27.667097

Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, speaks in opposition to House Bill 1365 from the Senate floor on April 15, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate on Tuesday approved legislation that would remove race and gender quotas and qualifications for a variety of state boards and commissions. The bill now awaits the governor’s signature. 
Rep. Karilyn Brown, a Sherwood Republican and lead sponsor of House Bill 1365, told a House committee last month that requiring a minimum number of women and members from underrepresented groups to serve on the panels is unfair. 
Brown said “diversity occurs naturally” and the state should not codify language that “makes things more awkward or more difficult to fill positions.”
HB 1365 advanced all the way to the Senate before being recalled to the House for an amendment that removed an entire section of the bill referencing the Arkansas Ethics Commission. Brown told the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committees on April 2 that the revision was needed because the commission was created through an initiated act and therefore that section of code needed 67 votes in the House to be amended.
Panel OKs proposed removal of racial and gender quotas for Arkansas boards and commissions

HB 1365 originally passed the House with 61 votes on March 5. The vote was later expunged and the House approved the amended bill with 60 votes on April 3.   
Upon its return to the Senate on Tuesday, no one spoke in favor of HB 1365, and Sen. Clarke Tucker was the sole lawmaker to speak against it. Of all the bills related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) during the last two sessions, Tucker called HB 1365 “the most harmful.” 
DEI-related bills approved by lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session include Act 112, which will “prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment” by public entities and retention plans and reports from public school districts and higher education institutions, and Senate Bill 520, which would prohibit DEI policies and practices in local government. 
There’s no advantage to serving in unpaid positions on boards and committees, Tucker said, but removing quotas eliminates the opportunity for some people to have a voice in policymaking. Among the panels affected by the proposed law, Tucker singled out the State Board of Education, whose membership would no longer be required to “reflect the diversity in general education” under HB 1365.
“We are so afraid of diversity that we are eliminating that line from code; it doesn’t even say what kind of diversity,” he said. 
Diversity is important, Clarke said, noting that the Senate’s membership represents geographic diversity. 
“We have lost all common sense when it comes to that word because of the politics of the time, and this bill goes too far,” he said. “What it does again is eliminate the ability of populations who have been historically underrepresented or oppressed to even have a voice in their state government, and that is wrong and I hope we don’t pass it this afternoon.”
HB 1365 passed the Senate Tuesday with 24 yes votes; the body’s six Democrats voted no. Republican Ronald Caldwell of Wynne, Jonathan Dismang of Searcy, Jim Dotson of Bentonville and John Payton of Wilburn did not vote, while Jim Petty of Fort Smith voted present.

John Fuller championed a $55 million education bill by reminding the Senate of his fiscally conservative values.
“Some of you may know that I’m so tight, I squeak when I walk, but I do support public education, and I support it fiercely,” Fuller, R-Kalispell, said on Tuesday.
Sen. Sara Novak, a Democrat from Anaconda, said House Bill 252 isn’t perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction, and it will help especially small rural schools and young educators.
“It is some much-needed funding to our public schools to directly impact our teacher wages and specifically our beginning teacher wages,” Novak said.
The Senate voted 40-10 in favor of the STARS Act, or Student and Teacher Advancement for Results, sending it to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee for a closer fiscal analysis.
It’s among the bills to help public schools that one supporter said bolsters education without adding undue stress to already beleaguered residential property taxpayers.
Montana has struggled to increase starting teacher pay, and a proposal from the 2023 legislative session didn’t work as planned.
Backed by the Governor’s Office, HB 252 earned bipartisan support, although some critics said it doesn’t do enough for veteran teachers, who also need to be paid well.
Sponsor and Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, has said the bill aims to fix an ongoing problem, which is low pay for beginning teachers, and the state doesn’t have unlimited funds.
The bill would spend more than $110 million from the general fund in the biennium, according to the most recent fiscal analysis.
It also has other provisions to support education, such as incentives for academic achievement for students and tools to help teachers in areas with high housing costs.
After the Senate floor vote, Lance Melton, with the Montana School Boards Association, said funding proposals before the legislature, including the STARS Act, have been written to guard against a spike in local property taxes.
Property tax income goes in part toward public schools.
“All of those proposals have two — front and center — primary stakeholders, the child and the taxpayer,” Melton said.
The fiscal analysis estimates an increase to local school property taxes of $800,000 a year, but those dollars are associated with housing support voters might approve through local levies, not incentives for teachers.
Melton pointed also to House Bill 483 and House Bill 515, which both passed out of the House with bipartisan support and are in the Senate.
Sponsored by Rep. Courtenay Sprunger, R-Kalispell, HB 483 would take any revenue growth that exceeds the state’s obligation to a school equalization fund and return it to taxpayers.
It has other Republicans and Democrats as co-sponsors and passed with a bipartisan 87-11 vote out of the House.
House Bill 515, sponsored by Rep. Linda Reksten, R-Polson, would in part help schools with major maintenance costs without asking property taxpayers for a levy or a bond.
On the House floor, Reksten said it has support from the Governor’s Office.
She said the bill transfers $75 million of one-time-only money from the general fund surplus to fill the school facilities trust fund — without affecting property taxpayers.

(Photo by Blair Miller)A federal judge has granted an emergency restraining order which will prevent U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting two Montana State University graduate students who were notified that their status as foreign students was being revoked.
Montana University System officials reported last week that at least four students in the state had their F-1 visas revoked and their F-1 status terminated. Each of the students say that the federal government was revoking their status, even though the students had not been notified, had not been convicted of a crime, and had not received notice of the change. Two of the students, both graduate-level students in Bozeman have challenged the decision in federal court and are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.
In an emergency motion filed Monday, the ACLU claims that the students learned of the status change as the university system was handling routine status checks. The federal government, through Noem, didn’t just eliminate their F-1 visa, which allow a student to enter the country; the department cancelled their entire F-1 status, meaning that the students could deported at any time.
One student in the Montana lawsuit is a doctoral student in electrical engineering, the other is a master’s level student in microbiology. Both are reportedly set to graduate from their programs during 2025.
In an emergency ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen found that the case was similar to one in New Hampshire in which the court also found that the federal government had not followed its own procedures for revoking the status, and violated a number of due-process protections, which allows a student to challenge the decision before an independent court.
Attorneys for the federal government have not made their appearance to defend the Trump administration’s decision, but Christensen noted in his ruling on Tuesday afternoon that attorneys for the ACLU had been trying to get a response from the U.S. District Attorney’s Office in Montana.
“As of the date of this order, defendants have not responded to plaintiffs’ motion,” Christensen noted in his order.
The temporary restraining order says that officials must restore the students’ status and must not initiate deportation proceedings for two weeks. It also stops Homeland Security from ordering their “arrest, detention or transfer” from Montana without proper notice and a chance for attorneys to contest the action.
Christensen set a court hearing for the matter on April 29 in Missoula, and ordered the federal government to respond by then.
“The court finds that the plaintiffs are likely succeed on the allegation that (Homeland Security’s) termination of (their) F-1 student status … is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to constitutional right, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory jurisdiction,” Christensen said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3666-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

Deidre Henderson sign HB100 at a ceremonial bill signing event at the Utah State Capitol on April 15, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)When representatives from the Policy Project toured schools across the state ahead of a legislative proposal to expand the school free lunch program, they heard plenty of stories of how food insecurity affects Utah students. 
In Logan, a student athlete said he often scavenged pizza from a dumpster. In West Valley City, a student who lived in a car said she had no way to cook food like mac and cheese that her family got from a food bank. In the Granite School District, a social worker described the academic decline of a student who is often hungry because of financial difficulties. 
Utah is still far from establishing a universal free lunch program in public schools. However, lawmakers approved a first step to expand who gets to access meals at no cost this year with HB100, a bill Gov. Spencer Cox ceremoniously signed on Tuesday.

“This bill and what it accomplishes isn’t just about providing school lunch, it’s about helping kids learn, and kids can’t learn when they’re hungry,” Cox said on Tuesday. “So we appreciate those hardworking class families who do so much to take care of their kids, and we know that this can alleviate just one more of those burdens for those that are struggling the most.”
Utah appears ready to spend millions on free meals for eligible students

The legislation allows those who qualify for reduced-cost meals to access the free lunch program in Utah, approving a one-time payment of $2.5 million to support the program.  
The bill also prohibits schools from publicly identifying or stigmatizing a student unable to pay for a meal, or from requiring them to perform chores to make up for the cost. Additionally, it provides students longer lunch breaks to avoid food waste, and allows unopened food to be returned for redistribution. 
Currently, students in households with incomes at or below 130% of federal poverty levels qualify for federal free school meals. With Utah’s legislation that will become effective on July 1, those in the state with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level, who could previously only access reduced meal fees, would be eligible for free lunches. 
Overall, it would benefit about 40,000 Utah children. 
The food insecurity issue was well known in the state, but it received special attention when FOX13 revealed that the combined school lunch debt in Utah was about $1.7 million in 2023. That number grew to $2.8 million in 2024.    
While no one is denied a meal in schools, according to FOX13, the debt may follow students throughout their school years, and may forbid them from walking in their graduation. 
Last year, Cox redirected $1.2 million in federal COVID-19 relief to start a grant program to address the debt. However, he said on Tuesday, up until now there wasn’t a permanent solution to the issue.    
To help settle $2.8 million in school lunch debt, Gov. Cox finds $1.2 million. What about the rest?

It wasn’t the first time the bill sponsor, Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, proposed legislation like HB100. In 2024, a request for $4 million in appropriations to expand the school lunch program failed to make it to the state’s budget. 
“This bill, while exciting in many ways, just shows that the process does work. Shows that when people come together who are really unified on a key issue, like Gov. Cox said, that hungry kids cannot learn in the classroom, and we’re spending $7 billion on education. Well, let’s do something about that,” Clancy said on Tuesday. “And that’s how this bill came to be.”
In Utah, 1 in 6 children face food insecurity, Clancy told the Senate Education Committee in March. All of them are from working families that don’t qualify for assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), often known as food stamps, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). 
After the signing ceremony Emily Bell McCormick, president of the Policy Project, a nonprofit that promotes solution-based policies in the state and supported the legislation, described passing the bill as “a battle,” but she was glad to finally see it come to fruition.



Let us know what you think...


 


“We all understand the burden that’s on us when it comes to this, especially with rising housing costs and the cost of living being more expensive here in the state of Utah,” she said. “Spending $12 a day on a school lunch if you have three or four kids, it’s pretty difficult. It’s difficult for those families who barely make ends meet.”  
It was a challenge to find ways for the state to pay for school lunches in an efficient manner, Bell McCormick said. However, the bill authors were able to identify those who aren’t getting any other assistance, and may be stuck working multiple jobs to sustain their families. 
“When we looked at that, and then you look at how much we spend on education, billions of dollars (…) and the cost of this is less than $3 million,” she said. “And so it really increases a child’s chance of learning.”

But on day 76 of a maximum 90 day session, legislators were still debating a couple of key proposals they’d debated back in January.
Senate President Matt Regier said on Tuesday there was a chance the discussion could come to a “stalemate” but also described the discussion around property taxes as “right there.”
He went on to say some of the slow roll dealt with legislators wanting to see their bills get through before the session ends, which could impact how they vote on property tax proposals.
Property tax reform is seen as the major obstacle to the Legislature coming to a close. Deals and amendments to bills have been circulating and likely will only increase in number as the session gets closer to the finish line.
In his state-of-the-state address in January, Gov Greg Gianforte called on the legislature to send the homestead rate cut proposal to his desk within a month —  a deadline that passed without action. At a press conference last week, Gov. Greg Gianforte said his position on prioritizing property tax relief hadn’t changed. 
“Montanans sent us here to act to get the job done, and we must,” Gianforte said last week. “I remain committed to cutting taxes for Montanans at every income level, leaving them more of their hard-earned money.”
Tuesday, Regier said it’s a matter of getting the “property tax pieces” together.
“And once we do that, I think the floodgates will break, at least here in the Senate,” Regier said.
Executive action on a number of bills currently in the Senate Taxation Committee is expected on Wednesday morning, with the chair of the committee, Sen. Greg Hertz, saying they were looking to clear out their docket.
Some Republicans have pushed the Governor’s Homestead Act, House Bill 231, which changes some rates and targets second homes, but the bill has seen obstacles in the Senate after getting through the House. It was tabled in the Senate tax committee but revived a week later.
Several cities, including Billings, have said it will increase property taxes in their locales, or cut services, like police and firefighters. Regier also noted concern on raising taxes on second homes from conservative members of his caucus.
“Raising Montana’s property taxes, whether that’s them doing an Airbnb or, like the family cabin, they said to me, that’s it,” Regier said. “I think for a lot of Republicans on this side, it’s a no go.”
One option some Republicans, including Regier, have pushed is Senate Bill 90, which aims to provide a property tax credit and is also at a standstill.
It would use lodging tax and rental car revenue to fund the credits. Some Democrats have bristled at the idea a rebate is the property tax solution Montanans are looking for.
“Last sessions, Band-Aid rebate checks were not enough,” House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan said on Tuesday. “Taxes have grown higher.”
SB 90 has already passed through the Senate, but did not make it through committees on the House side. An attempt to use a blast motion to move the bill onto the House floor narrowly failed on April 11, but SB 90 could be blasted again, Regier said. He said it could be implemented quickly and its funding stream was flexible.
“We could pass SB 90 right now, have it to the governor’s desk by Friday, and then the very next week … we could dump in one-time only money,” Regier said
During a press conference on Tuesday, Democratic leadership blamed Republicans for not being serious about property tax relief and not taking enough time on the issue.
Sullivan brought a clock with her to the press conference, saying she’d used it to track the amount of time spent arguing over “bathrooms, abortions and talking about chemtrails.”
The mood from their caucus was, in short, frustrated.
“We spend an incredibly large amount of our time on the floor debating things that have nothing to do with taxes,” Sullivan said. “If you were to compare it to the amount of time we spent on property taxes, there’s a huge difference.”
Democratic leadership also hinted that Rep. Jonathan Karlen’s House Bill 154, which is a targeted property tax credit toward renters, may also come off the table.
Rep. Ed Byrne’s House Bill 528 had a hearing earlier this week and it passed out of the House with significant bipartisan support. The bill was amended by Sen. Emma Kerr-Carpenter, D-Billings, to attempt to alleviate a potential conflict with city charters, like Billings’. The amendment would direct cities to ignore mill levy limits in their charters, though it’s unclear if that has legal standing.
But Byrne, a representative from Bigfork, also mentioned SB 90 during his testimony, saying it “stands on its own (and) is probably the best bill out here for what we’re looking at.”
The legislature does have other options, including a proposal from Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, to freeze property taxes for two years. On that bill, Regier said, “everything is on the table.”
Democrats, meanwhile, said it wasn’t nearly enough.
“That’s kind of kicking the can down the road,” Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade said. “And that’s in some ways no better, and maybe worse, than a rebate.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gettyimages-1190995919-170667a.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon,” Biden said. “They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees — 7,000 — out the door in that time, including the most seasoned career officials.”The Social Security Administration announced earlier this year it would cut staffing from 57,000 to 50,000 employees and reduce the number of regional offices from 10 to four.Biden urged Republicans to preserve Social Security for future generations, arguing during his 30-minute speech to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors, and Representatives for the Disabled in Chicago that people have been able to rely on it throughout wars, recessions and the pandemic.“Social Security is about more than retirement accounts. It’s about honoring a fundamental trust between government and people,” Biden said. “It's about peace of mind for those who work their whole lives, so they can rest assured they’ll have a chance to get back some of what they earned and what they deserve.”Biden, who accepted the organization’s Beacon of Hope award, said protecting Social Security and the federal workers who administer the program is about defending core principles.“Who are we? What makes us distinct from the rest of the world?” Biden asked. “It comes down to basic, in my view, fundamental American values — nobody's king, nobody's the boss. Everybody has a shot.” Biden criticized members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet for making harsh comments about the program. He noted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said his mother-in-law wouldn’t complain if she missed a Social Security payment and that “the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen because whoever screams is the one stealing.”Biden also called out billionaire and head of U.S. DOGE Service Elon Musk for calling Social Security a “Ponzi scheme.”“​​What the hell are they talking about?” Biden said. “People earn these benefits. They paid into that benefit. They rely on that benefit.”White House pledges to maintain programWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing several hours before Biden’s speech the Trump administration doesn’t plan to cut off Americans’ Social Security benefits.“Let me make it very clear ahead of former President Biden’s remarks: The president, this president, President Trump is absolutely certain about protecting Social Security benefits for law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens and seniors who have paid into this program,” she said. “He will always protect that program. He campaigned on it. He protected it in his first term.”Leavitt also took a swipe at Biden’s age, saying she didn’t expect him to give a speech during the evening.“My first reaction when seeing former President Biden was speaking tonight was, I’m shocked that he was speaking at nighttime. I had thought his bedtime was much earlier than his speech tonight,” she said. Biden, 82, last year dropped his reelection bid in a rematch against Trump, 78, amid concerns about his age and mental acuity.Administrator nominee to target errorsDemocrats have raised concerns for months that staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration will impact Americans’ ability to get their questions about the program answered or their issues resolved quickly.Social Security Commissioner nominee Frank Bisignano testified during his hearing in March that, if confirmed, he would try to “ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.”Bisignano said he hoped to ensure Social Security recipients could visit an office, use the website, or speak to a real person after calling the 1-800 number.“On the phone, I'm committed to reducing wait times and providing beneficiaries with a better experience; waiting 20 minutes-plus to get an answer will be of yesteryear,” Bisignano said. “I also believe we can significantly improve the length of the disability claim process.”Bisignano promised lawmakers he would reduce the 1% error rate in payments, which he said was “five decimal places too high.” And he said repeatedly that personally identifiable information will be “protected.”The Senate Finance Committee voted along party lines in early April to send Bisignano’s nomination to the floor, but he hasn’t yet been confirmed.",,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

(Courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)A package of funding options for local transportation infrastructure — sparked by an impending fiscal cliff — passed Indiana’s Senate on Tuesday. But it will likely be finalized in a conference committee, per a key lawmaker.
“We’ve coordinated closely with the city of Indianapolis and other major units (of government) to try to get more funding on the landscape to more effectively handle our road needs,” said Sen. Mike Crider, the measure’s sponsor.
He cited increasing fuel efficiency, inflation, electric vehicles, alternative fuel and more as complicating the financial future for local roads and bridges.
Lawmakers seek road-funding changes, hope to avoid fiscal cliff

House Bill 1461 would change up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program, raise the speed limit on Interstate 465 and let local governments tap into excess township funds, among numerous other provisions.
Crider read aloud a message from the Indiana Township Association that said its members didn’t want to be included in the legislation, but that it was “inevitable” and that the organization is comfortable with the language.
“I think this bill is going to conference committee, and I’m happy to work with them,” Crider added. “I have not heard anything further today from them, and so, based on that, I’m assuming we’re okay. But I can assure the members of the chamber that both (author) Rep. (Jim) Pressel and myself were in constant communication with all the players in this discussion.”
He also noted opinions diverge on language allowing the Indiana Department of Transportation to submit a request to the Federal Highway Administration for a waiver to toll lanes on interstate highways.
“There’s (been) a lot of concerns expressed, particularly around the tolling aspect,” he told his colleagues. “I would remind you that the language related to tolling is all based on the state applying for and receiving a waiver from the federal government, which may never happen.”
Even if that does occur, he noted the State Budget Committee would have to approve any plans before implementation.
The Senate advanced House Bill 1461 on a 38-10 vote.
When legislation goes to conference committee, lawmakers typically hammer out a compromise behind closed doors. If a measure survives that process, it’ll head back to each chamber for a final vote before going to Gov. Mike Braun.

A U.S. Department of Defense inspector general report evaluating the decision on where to house U.S. Space Command headquarters highlights the key points of contention in the selection process and why certain agencies had a preference on where it should be located.
The report found that while Air Force leaders decided Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville was the preferred location for Space Command because of cost efficiency, Space Command leaders argued Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, where the headquarters are currently located, made more sense for operational readiness and civilian workforce retention. The agencies also came to different conclusions around risk assessment and risk mitigation.
Space Command leaders argued that many of the full-time employees in Colorado Springs would not move to Alabama and would leave their positions. Constructing secure operational facilities in Huntsville would take three to four years after the final basing decision was made, the report says.

Space Command’s final location has been a matter of intense debate between Trump’s first term and former President Joe Biden’s term. Colorado officials expressed concern that Trump’s decision to move headquarters to Alabama was politically motivated, because he waited until after the results of the 2020 election to make a decision. Trump won Alabama, but Biden won Colorado. Space Command reached full operational capacity at Peterson Space Force Base by December 2023 after Biden announced at the end of July 2023 it would stay in Colorado Springs.
Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall also did not announce a final location decision after the required environmental review in Huntsville was complete, the inspector general report notes. The report says that the Air Force secretary and the then-secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, were not interviewed by the inspector general, as the White House would not make them available without Department of Defense legal counsel present.
“A final location decision by the (Air Force secretary) would have allowed USSPACECOM to begin the process of relocating to (Redstone Arsenal),” the report says. “However, USSPACECOM continued to accelerate its approach of (full-operational capacity) at its provisional HQ location in Colorado Springs.”

Elected leaders weigh in

The report does not make any conclusions about which location would be a better home for Space Command, though members of Congress on both sides of the issue have claimed the report supports their state as the rightful location.
Colorado Democrats in Congress issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that keeping Space Command in Colorado is in the best interest of national security. That includes U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, and U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.
“Any relocation of U.S. Space Command’s headquarters would threaten our military readiness, cost years of valuable time and resources, and result in an irreversible loss of personnel and expertise,” the statement says. “As our nation’s adversaries are rapidly developing their own space capabilities, we don’t have time to waste. The decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was the right one and will ensure continued operations to safeguard America’s national security.”
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, claimed soon after President Donald Trump won the 2024 election that the president would relocate Space Command to Alabama. Colorado officials in Congress from both sides of the aisle have opposed that idea.
Colorado’s Republican delegation in Congress wrote to Trump at the start of April urging him to maintain Space Command’s operational readiness in Colorado Springs, citing the area’s already robust space military infrastructure.
Republican U.S. Reps. Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction, and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that losing civilian personnel in Colorado “will significantly impact the full operational capability during a time when our foreign adversaries pose a real risk to our national security. We cannot afford to move backwards during such a critical time.”
“China and Russia have advanced the weaponization of space, and the national debt has increased nearly 30% in the past few years,” the statement says. “Transferring the Command at such a turbulent time would jeopardize our national security, needlessly put American lives at risk, and create an unnecessary waste of taxpayer resources.”
Crank’s district, the 5th Congressional District, is home to Peterson Space Force Base and Space Command.
In a statement, Rogers — who chairs the House Armed Services Committee — said the report confirms the Trump administration was correct in choosing Huntsville to house Space Command and that the report “reveals an astounding lack of transparency and accountability by the Biden Administration.”
“The fact is that the Air Force recommended SPACECOM HQ be built in Huntsville, that any disruption associated with that move could be mitigated, and that moving to Huntsville would save the taxpayer over $420,000,000,” Rogers said in a statement.
U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Madison, whose district includes Huntsville, issued a statement on X saying Biden’s decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was “an attempt to further President Biden’s political agenda.”

,California,2025-04-15 23:19:07+00:00,CalMatters,Sonoma State’s plan to cut more than a dozen majors is on pause,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/04/sonoma-state/,Sonoma State faces a $24 million budget shortfall after a steep drop in enrollment. The school has already shed almost $26 million in expenses.,"In summary
Sonoma State faces a $24 million budget shortfall after a steep drop in enrollment. The school has already shed almost $26 million in expenses.


A judge in Sonoma County has temporarily blocked California State University leaders from cutting academic programs at Sonoma State, for now pausing a plan that was supposed to save the cash-strapped campus tens of millions of dollars.Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Kenneth English issued the temporary restraining order today and set a new hearing for May 1.This is a victory for the seven student-athletes who sued Sonoma State’s interim president and the system chancellor over the campus leadership’s decision in January to terminate more than a dozen majors for the 2025-26 academic year, including philosophy, economics, modern languages and physics. The campus also planned to eliminate the school’s National Collegiate Athletic Association sports teams.
Lawyers for the students argued that Sonoma State didn’t follow system procedures for terminating academic programs. They say the school should have conferred with the Academic Senate, a body of full-time professors that shares governance duties with school administrators on academic matters.“There’s just supposed to be a process of proposing a plan, getting feedback, getting a recommendation from the Academic Senate, in addition to other steps that were not followed,” said Ross Middlemiss, a lawyer for the student-athletes and himself an alumni of Sonoma State and a former soccer player for the school.Sonoma State’s Academic Senate didn’t learn of the proposed cuts until Jan. 22, the day Interim President Emily F. Cutrer publicized her administration’s plans. The suit also argues that Sonoma State leaders didn’t follow its own rules for informing students about changes to their majors. The student body president of the campus only learned 10 minutes before the decision was made public. 
“The lack of consultation with any enrolled students or student leadership not only violated the regulations but also left the student body president without any ability to address the myriad of questions and concerns from confused and angry students,” the suit, which was filed March 7, states. 
Cal State wants cuts to fight budget shortfall
The judge’s ruling today blocked Cal State from ending only academic programs; Middlemiss and the other lawyers wanted the judge to also halt cuts to the sports teams. They’ll make their case at the May 1 hearing and hope to win an injunction, which would further prevent Cal State from going through with its cuts. 
Middlemiss said Cutrer has already asked the sports conference Sonoma State teams are in to drop the teams from future programming. That’s one reason the lawyers are rushing to reverse the cuts. “If they’re removed from the NCAA, the process to get back in is costly and uncertain and time consuming,” Middlemiss said.Sonoma State faces a $24 million budget shortfall after a steep drop in enrollment — from around 9,000 students in 2018 to 5,800 now. The school has shed almost $26 million in expenses, from not rehiring faculty to employing fewer management positions.The proposed cuts are meant to stabilize the school’s budget. Middemiss said he and the other lawyers for the plaintiffs doubt the system’s claims that cutting the sports programs would save the campus nearly $4 million. He said athletics at Sonoma State are budget-neutral and may even generate money. The school’s moves would lead to dozens of layoffs, including professors.
Sonoma State is an extreme example of Cal State’s escalating budget crisis. The 23-campus system has battled several years of budget shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars. It may also lose $375 million in state support — a decline of 8% — if a plan by Gov. Gavin Newsom that state lawmakers signed off on last year goes through this summer. But now legislators are advocating to lessen or completely reverse those planned budget cuts.“I will say, as a Sonoma State alum, as now a fourth-generation Sonoma County resident, it’s not only frustrating, it’s simply unacceptable,” said Sen. Mike McGuire, the leader of the state Senate, at a forum yesterday discussing the future of Sonoma State. He faulted Cal State system leadership for having an inadequate plan to help Sonoma State. “I am done being taken advantage of,” he said yesterday. “It feels like you are trying to run out the clock.”

Kelly Ayotte, President Donald Trump, and legislative and congressional Republicans continue to shape their marketing campaign for selling reductions in critical public services and programs as “reasonable adjustments” to spending, it’s important to keep up with your reading.

Kelly Ayotte, President Donald Trump, and legislative and congressional Republicans continue to shape their marketing campaign for selling reductions in critical public services and programs as “reasonable adjustments” to spending, it’s important to keep up with your reading.
If you’re a fan of dark comedy, you should check out an April 14 New York Times dispatch headlined “Republicans Ponder the Unthinkable: Taxing the Rich.”
The premise of the necessarily short piece is that congressional Republicans are so shocked by the degree to which they’ve bamboozled the working class that they’re “quietly” — and antithetically — considering doing them a solid by increasing the tax rate on top individual earners (those above $609,351). 
“For Republicans struggling with the roughly $4 trillion cost of continuing the 2017 cuts,” tax policy reporter Andrew Duehren writes, “letting the top rate snap back to 39.6% (where it stood before Trump cut it to 37% during his first term) would be an easy way to reduce the cost of the bill.”
Rather quickly, the story crumbles under the weight of its unlikelihood, placing it in the same news category as one headlined, “Powerball ticket buyer dreamily considers benefits of taking lump sum over annuity.” The lottery ticket won’t hit and the GOP won’t tax the wealthy, and so the pros-and-cons exercise is meaningless.
It shouldn’t be meaningless, mind you, but it is. Even though the Tax Policy Institute calculates the return to 39.6% would save about $366 billion, the Times story notes, “some Republicans quickly promised to try and kill any tax increases, and leadership was circumspect.”
With Republicans firmly established as the MAGA Party, I wonder where the highest marginal tax rate was set when that crowd last considered America to be “Great.” Was it the 88% of the Greatest Generation years of 1942 and 1943, or the 94% of 1944 and 1945? Probably not. Could it be that when they say “Great Again” they’re actually referring to the years just before and during the Great Depression, when the rate was 25% (and a low of 24% in 1929, the year that brought us Black Thursday)? While I’m sure they love that rate, it’s tough to put a positive spin on an era of global economic collapse, so no. But it’s also clear as day they don’t mean the mythologized golden years of 1951 to 1963, when the rate was steadily 91% (except for the two years, 1952 and 1953, when it was 92%).
“Great Again” has to refer to Trump’s beloved 1980s — the Gordon Gekko “Greed is Good” era. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the top rate was 70%, but by the time he left office after two terms, it was 28%.
How great has Reaganomics worked out for the American working class, you ask? Here’s what a first-ripple 1992 study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found, as reported by the Los Angeles Times on Aug. 28 of that year: “‘In the vast majority of states, economic growth during the 1980s was not shared evenly among the rich, the poor, and the middle class,’ the study concluded. ‘Instead, the wealthy fared substantially better than other income groups.’”
Nearly three decades after that study, a 2020 Pew Research Center report offered a longer view of the kind of economic growth that is “not shared evenly among the rich, the poor, and the middle class”: Since 1980, Pew researchers said, there has been an “uninterrupted increase in inequality” in America.
And, this past October, the Congressional Budget Office reported that as of 2022, “families in the top 10% of the distribution held 60% of all wealth, up from 56% in 1989.” Meanwhile, for the rest of the top half, that percentage fell from 37% to 34%, and the bottom 50% remained steady from 1989 to 2022 — at a shame-of-the-nation 6% (which, without factoring in future Social Security benefits, is actually 3%). 
That’s a lot of numbers, so here’s the flashcard: The top 10% in America holds about two-thirds of all wealth and the bottom 50% holds just (and optimistically) one-twentieth. And, since the beginning of the GOP’s beloved (and still unfolding) Reagan Revolution, the middle class share has been heading in the wrong direction.
If you listen to the Republican Party now — from Ayotte to Trump to legislative and congressional leaders — you won’t hear about this nation’s obscene acceleration of economic inequality since 1980. What you will hear, however, is an abundance of blame placed on those with the least — the undeserving Medicaid and SNAP recipients, the invading migrants, all of the people living with disabilities, various “welfare” fraudsters — for allegedly hollowing out the middle class. That sure sounds like an unbelievable amount of macroeconomic influence for people holding 3 to 6% of national wealth, doesn’t it?
Truly, statistically, commonsensically unbelievable.
Still, Republicans say they’re slashing budgets not to punish the less fortunate, which is inarguably what they are doing in practice, but to eliminate “waste, fraud, and abuse.” And they always say it in that singsongy order (“waste, fraud, and abuse”) because it’s meant to be an earworm marketing jingle rather than factual. You will also hear, from Ayotte, Trump, and Republican leadership, that any proposed Medicaid cuts will not affect “vulnerable” people — and they always use the word “vulnerable.” Why? Because since the November electoral victories they’ve been rewriting, all on their own, the definition of who is considered “vulnerable” so they can more easily sell the punitive as a “reasonable adjustment.”
I wonder: How many more decades of data do we need in order to see who has benefited — and who has not — from the Reagan-era policies exalted and expanded by the modern American right? And, when will it become clear to Granite State voters that New Hampshire Republicans are following — to the letter — a playbook that has resulted in historic levels of economic inequality and all its targeted suffering?
What I’m asking is, what will it take for the 90% who populate “Other America” to realize they’re getting played by the party of the 10%?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/inequality-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of lawmakers on Tuesday endorsed a bill that would allow the state to shift health insurance premium costs onto employees.
Senate Bill 2160, sponsored by Rep. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, would change the state employee health care plan to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act. This change would be irreversible.
The House Appropriations Committee voted 15-7 to give the bill a do-pass recommendation.
It will soon go to the House floor for a vote by the whole chamber.
 
More 2025 legislative session coverage


Supporters cite two main benefits to the policy. For one, it would cover a greater swath of services for employees — including contraception and preventative procedures like colonoscopies and mammograms.
Under the new plan, co-pays would also apply toward out-of-pocket maximums.
The new plan would cost about $6.6 million to implement for the 2025-2027 budget, according to an analysis attached with the bill. It says it would cost more than $25 million for the 2027-2029 biennium.
One of the more divisive components of the proposal is that it’d give the state the ability to make employees pay a portion of the insurance premiums. Right now, the state covers that cost.
Some said this would allow the state greater flexibility to address rising expenses for medical care.
“We have to start looking at ways to make a change for our budget, because we are not going to have the revenue coming in next time that we’ve had in the past,” said Rep. David Monson, R-Osnabock. “To ask people to kick in a little more out of their pocket, put some more skin in the game, I don’t think that’s unreasonable.”
Critics have said there isn’t enough concrete evidence to suggest the policy change is a good idea.
Molly Herrington, chief people officer of the state’s Office of Management and Budget, submitted testimony last month in opposition to the bill.
She said the state doesn’t have data on how many employees would prefer to change to an Affordable Care Act compliant plan.
“Funding increases for the upcoming biennium are planned to be covered through PERS reserves, but we are concerned with how future costs will be covered long term and the risk that costs would be paid by employees,” Herrington wrote, referring to the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System. “If increased costs are pushed to employees, this would significantly dilute the strength of our total rewards package.”
Her testimony included survey results from 2022 and 2024 that indicate employees consider health insurance the most important benefit offered by the state.

“I think we’re treading down a very treacherous path that we may not fully appreciate with regards to retention and employees,” said Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, who voted against the bill.
North Dakota United, the union that represents public employees, opposes the bill. President Nick Archuleta said the state Legislature should study the issue during the upcoming interim session to field more thorough feedback from state employees about what kind of health insurance they want.
“They should not fear taking the time that it takes to get the information needed to make a good decision,” he said.
Some have testified that they believe the new policy could be a draw for state employees, however.
“We see this bill as, frankly, a retention tool for some of our employees, for the different benefits that are covered that are not covered right now,” Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread told lawmakers at a previous committee hearing.
In written testimony, Insurance Department Deputy Commissioner John Arnold elaborated that the agency still worries about the long-term impacts of changing the plan. 
“A shift in costs could create an additional financial burden on state employees, ultimately affecting the workforce’s morale, retention, and the state’s ability to attract top talent,” he wrote.
Arnold said the department would support adding an Affordable Care Act plan as an option for employees if it also allowed them to remain on the existing plan.

Phil Murphy says will make commuting a more positive experience this summer. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday commuters should brace for some short-term disruptions to rail service as Amtrak replaces old wires and broken signals in an effort to prevent another summer of delays.
Murphy met with Amtrak officials in Newark to highlight repairs being made to the aging rail infrastructure that moves hundreds of thousands of commuters between New Jersey and New York daily. Murphy said momentary pain is necessary for a “meaningfully better commuter experience.” 
“We can’t bat a thousand on the one hand, but on the other hand, a lot of progress has been made that would have a tangible and specific impact, positively, on the commuter experience going forward,” Murphy said. 
Amtrak, which owns tracks and other infrastructure used by NJ Transit trains on the northeast corridor, the busiest commuter rail line on the continent, has often drawn rebukes from New Jersey elected officials who say the agency does not do enough to prevent delays for NJ Transit customers. 
Officials said Tuesday they plan to get work done before the temperatures rise over the summer, spikes that are often blamed for service delays and cancellations. 
“This is as far from a blame game as you can imagine right now,” Murphy said. “Facts are facts, but this is the spirit of coming up with a better customer and commuter experience, as good an experience as possible.” 
Kris Kolluri, CEO and president of NJ Transit, said customers will be told about the service changes up to four weeks in advance. Kolluri said a list of outages will be published by the first week in June, “well in advance, so our customers will know.” 
Officials said they plan to replace overhead wires that can become tangled and cause train delays, increase inspections, add crews to respond to problems, and message customers more frequently about delays and cancellations.
The ongoing work is part of a broader plan to address the region’s aging rail infrastructure and as the state prepares to host the first FIFA Club World Cup this summer and the World Cup next summer.
Last summer marked the second-worst summer for NJ Transit under Murphy’s administration, with more than 1,800 trains canceled (the worst was in 2020, when a tropical storm stopped trains on multiple rail lines for several days).

Bob Ferguson’s office debated plans earlier this year to send 200 National Guard troops to the Canadian border to assist with the Trump administration’s attempts to stop drug trafficking.
Ferguson ultimately decided not to pursue the plan. 
But Washington military officials went so far as to draft a letter on the governor’s behalf pitching the idea and commending President Donald Trump for his “continued efforts to combat the flow of illegal narcotics through the northern border.”
While the letter was never sent, the episode offers a window into how the new governor’s administration was trying to strike a balance working with a president whom Ferguson himself has sparred with repeatedly and who is deeply unpopular in much of Washington state.
The Standard obtained the letter — addressed to Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — through a public records request. 
Ferguson’s communications director, Brionna Aho, said this week that Ferguson did not request the letter and did not write it himself, even though it was drafted as though it were from him.
She said the letter was rooted in discussions between the governor’s office and the Washington Military Department about the potential for Trump to federalize the state’s National Guard. 
State Adjutant General Gent Welsh raised this possibility based on conversations with federal officials and media reports, Aho said. 
As adjutant general, Welsh commands the state’s National Guard, directs the Washington Military Department and serves as the governor’s homeland security advisor.
In early February, Welsh reached out to Ferguson’s chief operations officer, Shane Esquibel, to raise the issue. To avoid federal activation, the governor could deploy the state’s National Guard “for a defined mission that is consistent with Washington’s values,” Aho said.
On Feb. 7, Ferguson’s top advisors met with officials from the Military Department, which drafted the letter ahead of the meeting to discuss. 
Esquibel, now the governor’s interim chief of staff, briefed Ferguson on the proposal, but the governor decided against it, according to Aho.
“As you can imagine, many ideas are presented to the governor,” Aho said in an email. “The governor does not take action on all of them. This is one example.”
‘Ready to support’
The draft letter says “Washington is fully committed to partnering with the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense to confront” traffickers moving fentanyl and other illegal drugs.
The National Guard troops would have been ordered to “help with communications center support, analysis, transportation and construction, or any other mission deemed appropriate for DoD support,” so border patrol agents could focus on enforcement. 
Ferguson would have deployed the troops under Title 32 502(f) orders, meaning they would be under the governor’s control while the federal government foots the bill. Such orders are rare in Washington. 
The last Title 32 502(f) order was during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Karina Shagren, a spokesperson for the Washington Military Department. 
And the last time Washington’s National Guard troops were sent specifically to the state’s northern border was in the early 2000s, Shagren said. In that case, the president federalized the troops under Title 10, meaning the federal government controls their orders.
The letter also notes Washington stands “ready to support the Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force,” a new partnership that aims to combat transnational drug trafficking, money laundering and other organized crime. “I am prepared to allocate any necessary resources to ensure its success,” it says.
Ferguson has championed a bill in the state Legislature to give him the authority to stop National Guard troops from other states from deploying in Washington. House Bill 1321 has passed both chambers and now awaits the governor’s signature.
‘Where we can’
The Canadian border has been a flashpoint in the opening months of the second Trump presidency, with relations between the two allies souring and repeated calls from the president to make the neighboring country the 51st U.S. state.
Trump kicked off his term with the threat of tariffs to get Canada to boost border security and stop drugs from crossing into the United States. After former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in February committed more resources to fentanyl trafficking enforcement, Trump briefly called off the import taxes.
During his gubernatorial campaign last year, Ferguson committed to convening a statewide “crisis response unit” focused on the fentanyl crisis and called for boosting state funding for drug task forces.
In his Jan. 15 inaugural address, the governor pledged to work with the president “where we can,” while also saying, “We will stand up to him when we must.”
Almost immediately after Trump took office, less than a week after Ferguson was sworn in, new tensions began to build between the state and the president. 
As attorney general, Ferguson sued the Trump administration dozens of times during Trump’s first term. The state is now involved in 11 lawsuits against the second Trump administration, brought by Attorney General Nick Brown over everything from federal funding freezes to efforts to restrict birthright citizenship.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/canadian-border-crossing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 20:07:20.334851

Mike Dunleavy vetoed five bills, citing the fact that the Alaska Legislature passed them after the constitutional end of the legislative session.
So far in 2025, four of those five bills have been reapproved by either the House or Senate.
On Friday, the Alaska House of Representatives voted 37-0 to remove a requirement that fishing vessels register with the state Department of Motor Vehicles if they’re already registered with the U.S. Coast Guard and Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.
That removal will become law if the Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy also approve House Bill 31, which contains the removal and was the fourth of the five bills vetoed last year because of the missed deadline.
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, in both years.
Of the remaining missed-deadline bills, the Legislature has already passed two: one that allows state borrowing for a cruise ship dock in Seward, and another that allows teens to serve alcohol at restaurants, lodges and similar establishments. Senate Bill 15 is awaiting the governor’s action.
The Senate — but not the House — has passed a bill allowing employers to pay employees via “payroll cards.”
The last of the vetoed-and-reintroduced bills, which would have banned insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher rates to elected officials, has not received a hearing.

(Department of Defense Inspector General)A U.S. Department of Defense inspector general report evaluating the decision on where to house U.S. Space Command headquarters highlights the key points of contention in the selection process and why certain agencies had a preference on where it should be located. 
The report found that while Air Force leaders decided Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, was the preferred location for Space Command because of cost efficiency, Space Command leaders argued Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, where the headquarters are currently located, made more sense for operational readiness and civilian workforce retention. The agencies also came to different conclusions around risk assessment and risk mitigation. 
Space Command leaders argued that many of the full-time employees in Colorado Springs would not move to Alabama and would leave their positions. Constructing secure operational facilities in Huntsville would take three to four years after the final basing decision was made, the report says.

Space Command’s final location has been a matter of intense debate between Trump’s first term and former President Joe Biden’s term. Colorado officials expressed concern that Trump’s decision to move headquarters to Alabama was politically motivated, because he waited until after the results of the 2020 election to make a decision. Trump won Alabama, but Biden won Colorado. Space Command reached full operational capacity at Peterson Space Force Base by December 2023 after Biden announced at the end of July 2023 it would stay in Colorado Springs.
Then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall also did not announce a final location decision after the required environmental review in Huntsville was complete, the inspector general report notes. The report says that the Air Force secretary and the then-secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, were not interviewed by the inspector general, as the White House would not make them available without Department of Defense legal counsel present. 
“A final location decision by the (Air Force secretary) would have allowed USSPACECOM to begin the process of relocating to (Redstone Arsenal),” the report says. “However, USSPACECOM continued to accelerate its approach of (full-operational capacity) at its provisional HQ location in Colorado Springs.”
Elected leaders weigh in
The report does not make any conclusions about which location would be a better home for Space Command, though members of Congress on both sides of the issue have claimed the report supports their state as the rightful location. 
Colorado Democrats in Congress issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that keeping Space Command in Colorado is in the best interest of national security. That includes U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, and U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.
“Any relocation of U.S. Space Command’s headquarters would threaten our military readiness, cost years of valuable time and resources, and result in an irreversible loss of personnel and expertise,” the statement says. “As our nation’s adversaries are rapidly developing their own space capabilities, we don’t have time to waste. The decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was the right one and will ensure continued operations to safeguard America’s national security.”
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican, claimed soon after President Donald Trump won the 2024 election that the president would relocate Space Command to Alabama. Colorado officials in Congress from both sides of the aisle have opposed that idea.
Colorado’s Republican delegation in Congress wrote to Trump at the start of April urging him to maintain Space Command’s operational readiness in Colorado Springs, citing the area’s already robust space military infrastructure. 
Republican U.S. Reps. Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction, and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton issued a joint statement saying the report confirms that losing civilian personnel in Colorado “will significantly impact the full operational capability during a time when our foreign adversaries pose a real risk to our national security. We cannot afford to move backwards during such a critical time.”
“China and Russia have advanced the weaponization of space, and the national debt has increased nearly 30% in the past few years,” the statement says. “Transferring the Command at such a turbulent time would jeopardize our national security, needlessly put American lives at risk, and create an unnecessary waste of taxpayer resources.”
Crank’s district, the 5th Congressional District, is home to Peterson Space Force Base and Space Command.
In a statement, Rogers — who chairs the House Armed Services Committee — said the report confirms the Trump administration was correct in choosing Huntsville to house Space Command and that the report “reveals an astounding lack of transparency and accountability by the Biden Administration.”
“The fact is that the Air Force recommended SPACECOM HQ be built in Huntsville, that any disruption associated with that move could be mitigated, and that moving to Huntsville would save the taxpayer over $420,000,000,” Rogers said in a statement. 
U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, also an Alabama Republican, issued a statement on X saying Biden’s decision to keep Space Command in Colorado was “an attempt to further President Biden’s political agenda.”

After four hours of floor debate, the House passed the proposed amendment with 94 in favor and 50 against. Two Republicans — Speaker Jon Patterson and state Rep. Bill Allen — joined with 48 Democrats in opposition. 
As lawmakers prepared to vote, protesters with Abortion Action Missouri began chanting from the upper chamber, unfurling banners over the balcony protesting the proposed amendment. 
“When abortion rights are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back,” they shouted before security moved them into the hallway. 
 Protestors with Abortion Action Missouri interrupt Missouri House debate of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment Tuesday, chanting: “When abortion rights are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back” (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The legislation needs to be approved one more time by the House before it goes to the Senate. 
If approved by the Senate, and then by voters, the new amendment would reinstate a near-total abortion ban in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation.  
It would also protect women’s access to health care during miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and other medical emergencies. These protections are also in place under the current law.
In November, voters approved Amendment 3, which rolled back Missouri’s abortion ban and opened the door for clinics to begin performing the procedure for the first time since 2022. 
The proposed constitutional amendment debated Tuesday was filed by Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis of Moberly and is being carried by state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican. A previous proposed abortion ban was scrapped before making it to the full House, causing some to speculate about internal disagreements among GOP lawmakers causing roadblocks with a month left in the legislative session.
Seitz denies that there are any disagreements between GOP lawmakers, saying the current legislation before the House was the plan all along because it best matches with the language in a similar Senate proposal.
“We’re on the exact same sheet of music,” he said. “The timeline may appear long to the general public, but this is exactly the plan from the beginning.” 
Seitz insists that Missourians, in approving Amendment 3 with just shy of 52% of the statewide vote, were signaling that some exceptions were needed in Missouri’s prior abortion ban.
 State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson, debates a proposed constitutional amendment banning abortion on Tuesday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Since abortion was legalized late last year, Missouri Republicans have made it a priority to undo or weaken the current law, forcing many lawmakers to contend with their beliefs around abortion exceptions, something many have opposed in the past.
“I make decisions from a Biblical worldview,” Seitz told The Independent last week. “I have to understand that others may not, so pragmatically, how do we, particularly we that profess Christ as savior, how do we justify even the possibility of these exceptions for rape and incest?” 
His conclusion: Exceptions will still allow the GOP legislature to “save as many infants as possible and protect women.” 
During a marathon House debate on Tuesday, however, Democrats dismissed that argument. 
“You think you’re stopping abortions with these ridiculous bills? You’re not,” said state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson.  “You’re stopping safe, legal abortions. People are still going to have abortions. So if you want to be pro-life, let’s try being pro quality-of-life first.”
Proudie noted that at a House committee hearing, some lawmakers advocated murder charges for rape and incest survivors who seek out abortions. 
She was among several Democrats who shared stories of constituents who weren’t allowed to testify against the bill last week when state Rep. Holly Jones, who chairs the House Committee on Children and Families, limited testimony to only nine people, despite dozens more traveling to Jefferson City to oppose the legislation.
“My vagina is not mine,” Proudie said. “It belongs to the state of Missouri.”
 State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, debates a proposed constitutional amendment banning abortion on Tuesday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
If approved by both the House and Senate, Missourians could be asked to weigh in on reinstating an abortion ban as soon as a special election the governor could call this year, or during the 2026 midterm election. 
The proposed ballot summary doesn’t mention banning elective abortions. Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

Missouri state Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, said that no part of the ballot language “tells a voter that there will be fewer abortions allowed.”
Previous iterations of this proposed amendment included exceptions for survivors, but only if they first reported the rape or incest to police, a requirement that was highly criticized as dangerous by survivors and advocates. 
While the current version eliminated those requirements, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, remained skeptical of how survivors would be allowed to access the procedure. 
“Who is the arbiter of whether or not she was raped or a victim of incest?” asked Aune, who is herself a survivor. “The honor system?” 
After the passage of Amendment 3 in November, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, claiming that many of the TRAP laws on the books were rendered unconstitutional. A Jackson County judge agreed, striking down many of the current regulations as “discriminatory.” 
This decision allowed Planned Parenthood to again begin offering some procedural abortions at three of its clinics. Medication abortions, however, remain inaccessible. 
Jones said Amendment 3 was vague and “completely up to judicial interpretation” with unintended consequence. 
 State Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka, debates a proposed constitutional amendment banning abortion on Tuesday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
State Rep. Cathy Jo Loy, a Republican from Carthage, pointed to language in Amendment 3 referring to a “treating health care professional.”
Could that include a dietician or a speech pathologist, Jo Loy asked. 
“Absolutely,” Seitz replied.
State Rep. Jeremy Dean, a Democrat from Springfield who worked in health care for five years, including at an OBGYN office, disputed this. 
“You ever heard of scope of practice? You ever heard of a licensure? A governing body?” he said. Those are all things that exist that didn’t go away when Amendment 3 passed.” 
The proposed amendment also looks to require that any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County, a nod to the ongoing legal battle playing out between the state and Planned Parenthood in Jackson County.
Republican lawmakers on numerous occasions during Tuesday’s debate emphasized that the main goal of the amendment was to protect women.
“I ask that you stop trying to protect me or my constituents,” said state Rep. Jo Doll, a Democrat from St. Louis. “Because we can protect ourselves.” 
State Rep. Becky Laubinger, a Republican from Park Hills, rejected any accusations that anti-abortion lawmakers don’t care about women. 
Laubinger, who runs Monarch Family Resource Center in Ironton, said she’s gone out at all hours of the day to purchase diapers and pack n plays for families in need. She’s watched children so women could go to doctor’s appointments. 
Democrats ultimately accused their GOP colleagues of attempting to undermine the will of the people.
“Sending this back to them is not a democratic exercise,” said state Rep. Eric Woods, a Democrat from Kansas City. “It’s an attempt to slap them on the wrist, tell them they were wrong and maybe they can do it better next time.”

Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, told his colleagues during a committee hearing last month that he wanted to solve a common problem for Montana renters.
“When folks apply to an apartment, a certain apartment might get 20 applications. The second person might get the apartment, (but) 18 application fees might go into the pocket of the property manager,” Kortum told the Senate Business, Labor, and Economic Affairs Committee. 
His bill, House Bill 311, would require property managers to refund application fees to prospective renters who are not selected for an apartment or home. 
Kortum said his bill would fix bad business practices and protect consumers, especially workers and college students.
HB 311 passed a final vote in the Legislature on Tuesday, and is on its way to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk for a signature or veto. 
The bill drew bipartisan support in both chambers, but had a rough start in the House, where lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee tabled the legislation. Opposition to the bill, stemming mainly from the Montana Landlords Association and Montana Association of Realtors, had expressed concerns that the law would be put into the wrong section of code, and would target small property managers or individual landlords who would have to take extra steps to return fees. 
Proponents included the Associated Students of the University of Montana, the Montana Budget and Policy Center, and Joey Morrison, Deputy Mayor of Bozeman. They argued the bill was part of the affordable housing fix by helping to stabilize low-cost housing and keeping students and workers in the towns they live and work in. 
“Every day, Montanans pay rental application fees but don’t get the apartment,” Kortum said during the committee hearing. “Why are they paying for a service they never receive?”
A successful blast motion on the House floor — wherein the entire body votes to override a committee action — brought the debate to chamber.
“Last spring, I found myself in this position. I spent nearly $1,000 in six weeks applying for rentals here in Helena,” said Rep. Julie Darling, R-Helena. “I don’t have a thousand extra dollars — and I have a really good job — I don’t know how somebody else making minimum wage does this.”
The bill passed 63-31, with 26 Republicans joining all Democrats. 
In the Senate, Business and Labor committee amended the bill, following discussions with Kortum and some opponents, to change where the bill would be put into Montana Code Annotated, adding it to a section where property managers are regulated. The committee also amended the bill to target property managers who oversee four or more properties, exempting individual landlords and small management companies. 
The Senate approved the bill with bipartisan support 32-14. 
Kortum brought a similar bill during the 2023 session and in 2021 a Bozeman senator also proposed an application refund law, but neither garnered much support. 
Democrat leaders in the Legislature praised the bill’s passage on Tuesday and urged the governor to sign it into law. 
“Getting a roof over your head should not be a raffle or a lottery. HB 311 would end the housing lottery and stop landlords from harvesting exploitative fees from hardworking Montanans,” House Minority Leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said in a press release. “If signed, Democrats’ HB 311 would be one of the most significant policies enacted for renters in the last four years.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1347257020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 19:08:59.029137

In […]","An aerial view of the Pentagon on Oct. 28, 2018. (Photo by Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Quinn Hurt/Department of Defense)The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the U.S. Department of Defense over what it calls a sweeping campaign of censorship in public schools run for military families, including one in Virginia, accusing federal officials of banning books and curricula related to race, gender and civil rights in violation of students’ First Amendment rights.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the ACLU National, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the ACLU of Virginia allege that the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) and Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth have systematically stripped school libraries and classrooms of age-appropriate, award-winning materials. 
These include canonical works about slavery, the civil rights movement, gender identity, and sexual orientation, which were removed following a series of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump earlier this year.
The complaint, filed on behalf of eleven students at DoDEA schools around the world — including two at Crossroads Elementary in Quantico, Virginia — claims these actions have “irreparably harmed” children by denying them access to essential knowledge and perspectives, solely on the basis of “disfavored” political viewpoints.
“The Department of Defense Education Activity is quarantining library books and whitewashing curricula in its civilian schools,” the suit states. “With no regard to how canonical, award-winning, or age-appropriate the material, DoDEA today is scrubbing references to race and gender from its libraries and lessons.”
As of now, the Department of Defense has not responded to the lawsuit. 
The erasure campaign, according to the ACLU, stems directly from a trio of Trump administration executive orders — EOs 14168, 14185, and 14190 — aimed at purging “gender ideology,” “divisive concepts,” and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programming from all federal agencies, including the military school system. DoDEA operates 161 schools in the U.S. and overseas, serving more than 67,000 children of military and civilian Defense Department personnel.
While DoDEA says the effort is about safeguarding children from “radical indoctrination,” the plaintiffs argue the opposite is true and that students are being denied the opportunity to learn about foundational elements of American history and society. 
“Learning is a sacred and foundational right that is now being limited for students in DoDEA schools,” said Natalie Tolley, a plaintiff on behalf of her three children. 
“The implementation of these EOs, without any due process or parental or professional input, is a violation of our children’s right to access information that prevents them from learning about their own histories, bodies, and identities,” Tolley said. 
“I have three daughters, and they, like all children, deserve access to books that both mirror their own life experiences and that act as windows that expose them to greater diversity. The administration has now made that verboten in DoDEA schools.” 
In many schools, they say, books were pulled without notice and cultural events like Black History Month and Women’s History Month were abruptly canceled.
Emerson Sykes, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, emphasized that students in Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools are entitled to the same constitutional protections as any other young people — regardless of their families’ military ties. “Students in DoDEA schools, though they are members of military families, have the same First Amendment rights as all students,” he said.
Sykes described the current censorship push as particularly offensive, given the diversity and academic excellence of the DoDEA system. 
“Like everyone else, they deserve classrooms where they are free to read, speak, and learn about themselves, their neighbors, and the world around them,” he said, adding that removing books and lessons that reflect the experiences of women, LGBTQ people, and people of color serves only a narrow political agenda. “Our clients deserve better,” Sykes said, “and the First Amendment demands it.”
The suit includes detailed examples of books removed from shelves, including “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Fahrenheit 451,” “The Kite Runner,” “Well-Read Black Girl,” and “Julian is a Mermaid.” At least one AP Psychology course dropped an entire unit on gender and sexuality. In some cases, parents say they repeatedly requested a list of banned titles but were stonewalled by administrators.
In one particularly revealing memo cited in the complaint, DoDEA officials instructed librarians to remove any books related to “gender ideology” or “discriminatory equity ideology” from student sections and place them into staff-only “professional collections” for further review. 
The result, plaintiffs say, has been a chilling and confusing environment for both students and educators.
“Students’ limited access to disfavored viewpoints will lead to a reduction in diversity of thought and critical thinking skills,” the lawsuit contends. “Defendants’ actions are impairing the ability of students to seek out independent research or self-study opportunities in school libraries.”
The ACLU argues that DoDEA’s censorship campaign violates legal precedent, particularly the Supreme Court’s landmark 1982 decision in Island Trees School District v. Pico, which held that school officials cannot remove books from libraries simply because they disagree with their ideas.
“The First Amendment protects both the right to speak and the right to receive information,” the complaint says. “Defendants’ conduct infringes on students’ right to receive information from DoDEA school books and libraries, free from partisan, political censorship.”
The lawsuit seeks both declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to block the implementation of the executive orders as applied to public education, restore removed books and lesson materials, and affirm students’ constitutional rights to access ideas and information.
If successful, the case could reshape how federal agencies implement education policy, especially in schools where military and civilian communities intersect, and where the children of public servants are now at the center of a nationwide debate over who controls classroom content.

(Getty Images)A movement to invite counties from Illinois trying to secede from their state passed the Senate on Tuesday, with the Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission getting a nod from 36 senators. 
Three Republicans joined all ten Democrats to oppose the move, debating the motion for just over 30 minutes. 
“We all have our own opinions of how good things are here in Indiana, but folks from outside Indiana are eyeballing us,” said sponsor Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “… we’re just signaling to those Illinois counties that Indiana is open for business and we’d be happy to accept them.”
‘We’d love to have you’: Illinois secession bill earns Indiana House approval

Thirty-three counties have passed an “advisory referenda” signaling their desire to leave Illinois, with seven voting in the most recent November election. In a February committee meeting, some residents said they didn’t feel represented by the state and, specifically, Chicago.
The boundary commission would likely be a “generational conversation,” Baldwin acknowledged, and specifics like the impact on the state’s Medicaid rolls or child care shortage were yet to be ironed out. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura also noted that some Indiana counties might be interested in leaving the state to join neighbors like Illinois, Michigan or Ohio, all of which have legalized marijuana for recreational use. 
“Believe it or not, many of our constituents think this is a joke. They seriously think the General Assembly has more important policies to deal with, rather than sending political signals,” said Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “I’m proud of Indiana. I’m proud to be a resident of Indiana. I’m a proud legislator … I want my focus to continue to be that, not sending political messages to other states.”
Qaddoura’s colleague, Sen. Shelli Yoder of Bloomington, went even further and called the proposal “a political stunt.” She noted that Indiana doesn’t allow for citizens to approach law-making through a referendum — which is what Illinois residents used in their succession vote. 
A seemingly exasperated Sen. Aaron Freeman emphasized that the bill would just approve a commission, not a final boundary agreement. 
“If the fine people of eastern Illinois want to come here? Great,” said the Indianapolis Republican. “But don’t come up here and talk to me about things that have nothing to do with this bill for political purposes.”
Previously, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said such a move was “not going to happen.”
Due to committee amendments concerning commission membership, the House needs to accept the changes before the bill can become law.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)In a surprise agenda change for Wednesday’s meeting, the Louisiana Public Service Commission will consider terminating a statewide energy efficiency program it just recently hired a contractor to run after spending 14 years to create it.
Commissioner Mike Francis, R-Crowley, added the agenda item Monday, two days before the LPSC meets at the Cypress Bend Resort in Many. Most of the commission’s monthly meetings are held at its headquarters in Baton Rouge, but members periodically schedule hearings in different parts of the state.
“Commissioner Francis’ decision to bring this vote with virtually no notice leaves little time for public input on an issue that directly impacts household budgets and statewide energy policy,” the Alliance for Affordable Energy said in a statement issued Tuesday. The proposal would end all energy efficiency programs in the state, except for municipal-owned utilities that don’t fall under the LPSC’s jurisdiction.
The Alliance noted that residential electricity rates in Louisiana have increased roughly 45% since 2018, stressing the need for a greater emphasis on efficiency programs.
“This is the only program the commission has to help residents manage rising bills,” the group’s news release said.
In January 2024, the LPSC voted 3-2 on energy efficiency resources standards (EERC) that a consultant had worked on for over a decade at a cost of more than a half-million dollars. The policy requires utilities under the commission’s jurisdiction — such as Entergy, Cleco and Swepco — to meet certain energy savings targets each year. 
For example, they can meet the standards through customer-focused upgrades such as adding new insulation to buildings or replacing inefficient heating and cooling systems.
The utilities pay for it with little-noticed energy efficiency fees they’ve charged customers for years. Entergy Louisiana customers can find those fees on their monthly statements billed as “Rider EECR-QS” and “Rider EECR-PE.” 
Louisiana ushers in new energy efficiency policy with an uproar

The energy efficiency program used in Louisiana for the past decade was voluntary, and utility companies managed them with their own staff. Energy efficiency presents a dilemma for utilities because they lead to customers using less of their product, an inherent conflict of interest for companies that profit from the sale of electricity or natural gas. 
The program adopted in 2024 is mandatory and uses a third-party administrator to manage and hold the utilities to the energy savings targets. The LPSC recently hired two companies, Aptim and TetraTech, to provide those services.
Francis is proposing to terminate those contracts and establish a different energy efficiency policy. In a phone interview Tuesday, he said the current policy framework is too complex and believes it will cost too much money. 
“You need a lawyer and a CPA to work through all of this,” Francis said. “It’s pretty complicated.”
Francis initially opposed adopting the program in 2024 alongside Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, R-Metairie. Former Commissioner Craig Greene, R-Baton Rouge, provided the swing vote that passed the measure, which had support from the LPSC’s two Democrats, Foster Campbell of Bossier City and Davanté Lewis of Baton Rouge. 
Debate on the matter at that time attracted ratepayers who filled the meeting room and chanted, demanding commissioners vote on the new program after hours of discussion. That memory wasn’t lost on Francis, who admitted his latest proposal might not be popular with some members of the public.
“I’m probably making some enemies doing this,” he said.
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, R-Lafayette, who now sits on the commission in place of Greene, will likely be the deciding vote Wednesday. 
“Sounds like there are several ideas being bandied about regarding the program,” Coussan said, offering few clues about how he intends to vote. “I’m anxious to hear more about the proposals.” 
The program is the first of its kind in the Southeast run by a third-party administrator. 
It “is especially important when it comes to both environmental protection and electricity system affordability,” said Joshua A. Basseches, an assistant professor of environmental studies and public policy at Tulane University. “Scrapping it now would not only be bad public policy, but would also set a bad precedent in terms of process.”

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)Kinship caregivers in approximately half a dozen counties will be part of a new pilot program expected to start this summer designed to help support older New Mexicans and other relatives who take over raising children when parents are unable to do so.
That program is a result of House Bill 252, which establishes the Kinship Caregiver Support Pilot program, signed last week by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
Joey Long, a spokesperson for the Aging and Long-Term Services Department, told Source NM that the department does not anticipate services starting before the beginning of the next fiscal year, which begins in July. The process will also include a 30-day public comment period.
According to the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation, about 36,000 New Mexico children were raised by grandparents or other next of kin in 2023 – an increase from about 30,000 in 2017.
The bill states that the pilot program will be established in five to seven counties in the state with 50 participants chosen in each county. A previous version of the bill identified Rio Arriba, Santa Fe, Taos, McKinley and Doña Ana counties as communities participating in the program, but the specific counties were struck from the final version of the bill.
Long told Source in a written statement that the department is “assessing geographic areas based on data, stakeholder consultations, and availability of private funding to support participant stipends, as well as other considerations” before choosing communities to participate.
Program participants will eventually be connected to case management assistance, legal assistance, mental health support and respite care.
“Too often kinship caregivers—especially grandparents—are left to navigate complex systems alone while providing childcare,” Kaltenbach said in a statement. “This pilot program will help us establish more resources to help keep families together and ensure caregivers have the support they need to provide the best care possible.”
The program is a three-year pilot, meaning the state will evaluate the outcomes of all participants to help create a possible statewide program in future years. An annual report with outcomes and recommendations is due each December to the Legislative Finance Committee.

Mike Braun's desk.,"Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, addresses a crowd on Dec. 18, 2024 in Indianapolis. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Contentious regulations for marijuana-like products advanced through the Indiana House of Representatives on Tuesday, but will have to survive closed-door negotiations before crossing Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
“I filed a dissent,” Sen. Travis Holdman, the measure’s author, told the Capital Chronicle.
“We’ve got some clean-up to do,” the Markle Republican said. “… We’ll be working on it.”
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly — but are nearing law, in the form of Senate Bill 478.
Delta-8 regulatory qualms go unaddressed as Indiana House approves homelessness, DEI measures

“These products, being legal under federal law, but having no regulatory structure here in the state, means that technically, it’s not illegal to sell these products to minors (or) to target youth with advertising or packaging, and that there’s no testing requirements to protect consumers from potentially dangerous adulterants,” said Rep. Jake Teshka, the House sponsor, on the chamber’s floor Tuesday.
The measure sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements over the currently unregulated substances. It authorizes the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission to oversee the industry, including approving up to 20,000 retail permits.
Lawmakers have put it through a whopping seven rounds of edits. But critics — including Indiana’s attorney general and anti-marijuana groups — still have objected, arguing the language would expand existing loopholes.
“With Senate Bill 478, I think we finally have an opportunity to rein in this market,” Teshka, R-North Liberty, said. “We have the opportunity to provide real clarity to law enforcement, to protect Hoosier youth, to empower our farmers and to protect our consumers.”
Members of Teshka’s own caucus remained skeptical.
“I recognize that … the General Assembly should take action on the current state of this product,” said Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola. “… (But) I don’t feel like this is the appropriate action.”
Instead, it’s “moving us further down a path of increasing — dramatically increasing — access to these products that are known to have adverse and negative effects,” Wesco continued. “… We’re setting up a framework that we’re likely not going to go back on, that is just going to expand from here.”
Lawmakers from both parties crossed sides in the 60-37 vote.
The bill next heads to conference committee for negotiations. Conferees will hammer out a compromise. If it survives that process, it’ll head back to each chamber for a final vote before going to Braun.

Meanwhile, in the Florida Senate, that chamber’s version (SB 700) was debated on Tuesday and will go for a floor vote later this week, as well.
The omnibus proposal contains a multitude of provisions, including preventing public water systems from using additives like fluoride. At least 22 Florida communities have stopped fluoridating drinking water since November, after state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued guidance against the dental health practice.
In the House Commerce Committee on Tuesday to debate the measure (HB 651), Bailey Kuykendoll, operations director for Stand for Health Freedom, told the committee that her organization strongly supports the legislation because of the fluoride provision.
“Water fluoridation is a form of medical treatment,” she said. “It’s recognized as such by the FDA for addressing tooth decay. Most city commissioners and councilors are not doctors and should not be in a position to be prescribing treatment, especially when there’s no way to opt out.”
Miami-Dade County was one of the latest (and biggest) counties to attempt to ban fluoride in the past week, but Mayor Daniella Levine Cava vetoed the measure on Friday.
In the Florida Senate, Democrats filed amendments regarding the fluoride provision. One by South Florida Democrat Lori Berman would have given the power to regulate fluoride back to local governments — contradicting what the bill calls for.
Fellow South Florida Democrat Tina Polsky said there was no reason to do anything on fluoride, and questioned what was motivating the bill sponsor, Central Florida Sen. Keith Truenow?
“What has happened, besides it being the conspiracy theory du jour?” she said. “It’s time to stick with the science. Stick with what’s been working and not upend our whole health system based on unproven theories.”
Another amendment by Polsky would have required the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) to study the effects of water fluoridation in communities that have elected to fluoridate their water system and send that report to the governor, House speaker and Senate president.
Both amendments failed.
Meat vs. “meat”
The measure would also bar plant-based products from using “milk” and “meat” and “egg” labels. That prompted Orlando Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith to pose questions to Truenow.
“Are we saying that by labeling ‘oat milk’ that the manufacturers of that product are being untruthful and suggesting that this is milk that comes from a cow and not from oats?” he asked Truenow.
“I didn’t know that you could milk oats,” Truenow replied, making Smith laugh. “If you’re going to call that beverage or that material milk, then it should be coming from a cow or a goat or some other lactating animal.”
Another provision would change the number of extra days to issue a permit to carry a concealed gun if a background check reveals a potentially disqualifying criminal history
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) now has 90 days to issue or deny concealed carry permits and can suspend the process if a law enforcement agency or court notifies the department that the applicant has been arrested or charged with crimes relating to domestic violence, drugs, and other violence.
If the screening identifies information related to a crime that may disqualify the applicant, but does not contain the final disposition of the crime or lacks sufficient information to make an eligibility determination, the House bill says that FDACS would have an additional 45 days to review.
The bill originally called for an additional 90 days, but the compromise brought along Second Amendment supporters who had earlier criticized the measure.
ESG
Another part of the extensive legislation would establish that financial institutions “may not discriminate in the provision of financial services to an agriculture producer based, in whole or in part, upon an ESG factor.”
“ESG” stands for environmental, social, and governance. It’s a framework used to assess a company’s non-financial performance and sustainability practices, but the Florida Legislature has already passed a major bill in the 2023 session that prohibits and seeks to punish any consideration of these factors in the state’s investment decisions.
In the House committee, the Florida Bankers Association’s Anthony DiMarco said that with that legislation already enacted, there is no reason to include this provision. He said that the measure would encourage more lawsuits in the state. “We haven’t been told any real reason why this needs to be changed,” he said. 
Seminole County Republican Rep. David Smith said that while he supported the House bill, he didn’t like that “there’s aspects of the bill that I don’t like. I know I hear from my constituents that they don’t like these bills which have been so jam-packed  and so off-topic.”
“If you live in Florida, there’s no way that you can’t support agriculture,” added Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky. “Unfortunately, this bill isn’t just about agriculture.”
The measure passed easily in the committee, with only Hunschofsky and fellow Democrats Felicia Robinson from South Florida and Leonard Spencer from Central Florida voting no. The measure now goes to the full House for a vote.
The Senate will also vote on its final version of the bill later this week.

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho will try to ban a food assistance program from covering candy and soda.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which requires the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement known as “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers.
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement Tuesday. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
In Utah, lawmakers approved and Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill seeking to prohibit soda purchases under SNAP in the Beehive State. Kennedy visited Salt Lake City last week to celebrate the bill, along with other “Make America Healthy Again” legislation passed in Utah.
How will the SNAP bill affect local retailers?
Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws.
Idaho’s new law takes effect July 1.
In a prepared statement, Washington, DC.-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center SNAP Deputy Director Gina Plata-Nino critiqued SNAP restrictions, saying they “only deepen food insecurity and strip people of their autonomy.”
“This push to restrict what Idaho households can buy is an ill-conceived, recycled attempt to shame people who need food assistance and strip them of their dignity and autonomy when data shows that their diet isn’t much different from anyone else’s,” Plata-Nino told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Little signed the bill into law on Tuesday, the governor’s office announced in a news release. The bill passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments.
In the Idaho governor’s office news release announcing Little signed the bill, Kennedy wrote in a prepared statement, “I urge all governors to follow Idaho’s lead and submit innovative SNAP waivers to the USDA to reverse the childhood chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say
Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight.
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.

Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact on the state budget.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement she was excited more states “are heeding the call to Make America Healthy Again.”
“Governor Little is a true partner to USDA, and we look forward to working together on ways to use SNAP to improve health outcomes for Americans and encourage better use of taxpayer dollars,” she added.

The event — part celebration, part memoriam, part commitment to continue fighting —  occurred against the backdrop of federal cuts that advocates say threaten to reverse decades of progress in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.  
HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the body’s immune system. If untreated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, known as AIDS.
Thanks to more effective treatment and prevention tools, developed over several decades, the virus has gone from a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. In 2019, Connecticut reported that 220 people were newly diagnosed with HIV, down from 802 in 2002. 
AIDS advocate Doug Moffet said when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1987, he waited six weeks for an appointment to get tested and then had to wait another 12 weeks to receive the result. 
“The world is a very different place,” Moffet said, comparing what he went through in the 1980s to today’s reality, where people can receive the results of a rapid antibody test within 30 minutes, which can be confirmed with a lab test within just a few days.
But federal funding cuts could reverse that hard-earned progress, several speakers said.
Of the nearly 800 National Institutes of Health research grants terminated by the Trump administration, roughly 29% — over 200 grants — relate to HIV/AIDS, according to an article in the science journal Nature.
Layoffs and workforce reductions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services could also threaten the HIV/AIDS programs.
“It’s amazing to me how far we’ve come with regard to HIV in this country,” André McGuire, a retired lawyer, pastor and HIV activist who has been living with the virus for over 30 years, said as he addressed the crowd Tuesday. 
“If we stop putting money into prevention, then the same thing that happened at the beginning of this epidemic will occur again,” he said.
Advocates also raised concerns over a line item in the governor’s proposed budget that cuts $300,000 in funding for HIV prevention. West Hartford Democratic Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, who co-chairs the Human Services Committee and serves on the Appropriations Committee, called the move “short-sighted.”
“There is no appetite for those cuts on the legislative side,” Gilchrest said. 
Chris Collibee, spokesperson for the Office of Policy and Management, said in an email that the money represents funding that’s gone unused in years past.
“The reduction in the Governor’s budget proposal reflects the historic lapses over the past three years; we do not anticipate this funding adjustment would lead to a reduction in services,” Collibee wrote.
Despite major medical advancements, there is still room to improve on prevention and treatment within certain communities, McGuire said.
As of 2020, nearly 70% of people living with HIV in Connecticut were Black or Hispanic, despite only representing a combined 32% of the state’s population. Black and Hispanic men in the state were diagnosed with HIV at rates 10 and 3.5 times higher than white men, respectively. Black women accounted for more than half of new HIV diagnoses among women. 
McGuire said heterosexual Black men, for example, aren’t tested often enough for HIV, which he attributes, in part, to their own fear of stigma, but also a failure on the part of public health officials to reach them effectively. 
“As a Black male living with HIV, I feel invisible,” McGuire said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror following the rally, adding that many groups who get funding to do HIV/AIDS research don’t apply their work in Black and brown communities. 
The commemoration included a performance by Hartford’s Proud Drill Drum and Dance Corp, and ended with cheers from the crowd vowing to “fight back.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/doug-moffet-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 19:08:59.029137

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)The path of kratom legislation took another turn in the North Dakota Legislature Tuesday as the Senate changed a bill that sought to regulate the plant and turned it into a study. 
Kratom is a plant native to Southeast Asia that is related to the coffee plant. Some people consider it an energy booster, like caffeine, or use it to manage pain. Kratom also has been used to wean people off drugs such as fentanyl and heroin with some people reporting withdrawal symptoms. 
Earlier this session, lawmakers considered versions of legislation that proposed to ban kratom, require state regulation by two different agencies or various study proposals.
On Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, proposed an amendment to turn House Bill 1566 into a study by Legislative Management. 
The amendment and the final bill passed on 31-15 votes. 
Pain relief or a problem? North Dakota lawmakers hear kratom debate

The journey isn’t over yet for the kratom bill. It will be returned to the House, which passed a version giving the Agriculture Department regulatory authority and about $600,000 for two employees. 
Magrum said the wide-ranging attempts to regulate kratom by the Legislature, with its members largely unfamiliar with the plant, showed that a study made more sense. 
Kratom-related products are available to consumers, largely through online sales. 
Sen. Todd Beard, R-Williston, opposed the study amendment, noting that the kratom industry is advocating for regulation to combat adulterated products. 
Some products that contain kratom also include synthetic ingredients that enhance the opioid-like effects of kratom. 
The North Dakota Board of Pharmacy advocated for adding mitragynine, derived from kratom, to a list of controlled substances under state law.
The proposed study would look at potential uses for kratom and potential regulations on the production and sale of kratom products.  
Magrum said after the vote that he has used kratom on a couple of occasions to treat back pain. 
He said the first time he made the mistake of taking it on an empty stomach, which made his stomach hurt so much he forgot about his back pain, he joked. 
“At least people are learning about it,” Magrum said.

The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the justices ruled 9-0 Thursday that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return — though they stopped short of requiring it — and provide the El Salvadoran due process through the U.S. immigration courts.The Supreme Court “could not have been clearer,” Xinis said to Drew Ensign, the deputy assistant attorney general who represented the government Tuesday.Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, who lived with his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, and their 5-year-old child, was apprehended by immigration officials in mid-March.He was among roughly 260 Venezuelan men the U.S. flew on commercial jets, without due process, to Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Garcia has no criminal history in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country, according to court filings in the lawsuit Vasquez Sura brought against the government last month.An immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 shielding his return to El Salvador because of near certainty he would face violence and persecution.White House echoes BukeleU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted in court documents that Abrego Garcia’s removal on March 15 was an “administrative error.”The White House maintains it has no power to ask El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia from CECOT, and that Xinis overstepped her authority in ordering the administration to conduct foreign affairs.The White House also asserts Abrego Garcia is a “foreign terrorist” and a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13, which the administration designated a foreign terrorist organization in February.“Deporting him was always going to be the end result,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday at the daily press briefing.“There is never going to be a world in which this is an individual who’s going to live a peaceful life in Maryland,” she said.El Salvador President Nayib Bukele told journalists Monday during a visit to the Oval Office, “I don't have the power to return him to the United States,” labeling Abrego Garcia as a “terrorist.”The government echoed Bukele’s comments in its daily status report.“DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation,” Joseph Mazarra, acting general counsel for DHS, wrote in Monday’s report.Following a tense hearing Friday, where the government refused to provide the whereabouts of Abrego Garcia, Xinis ordered the administration to provide the daily updates.On Tuesday, Xinis told Ensign that the government has provided “very little information of any value” in the reports.“As a factual matter, I do need evidence in this record because to date what the record shows is nothing has been done,” Xinis said.Ruling requested on contemptPrior to Tuesday’s hearing, Vasquez Sura asked the court to order immigration officials to arrange for her husband’s return by the end of April 14.She also asked the court to mandate government officials provide documents and depositions related to Abrego Garcia’s release, and to show cause as to why Xinis should not hold the government in contempt of court for not complying with orders to bring Abrego Garcia back.Xinis said she will not make a decision on contempt until she reviews a record of evidence.The government maintains the Supreme Court’s decision does not mean they must work with El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia because the president, not federal courts, has jurisdiction over foreign affairs.The administration also contends that the Supreme Court’s use of the term “facilitate” only means that they need to remove “domestic” barriers to bringing Abrego back to the U.S. — not that they would have to work with El Salvador to secure his release.“Indeed, no other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable — or constitutional — here,” they wrote in a response to Vasquez Sura’s request.In the Oval Office Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the U.S. would provide a plane, but cannot force Bukele to release Abrego Garcia.Ensign provided a transcript of the Oval Office meeting to the court 15 minutes prior to Tuesday’s hearing, according to Xinis.“I don’t consider what happened yesterday as evidence before this court yet,” Xinis said.Ensign pushed back on Xinis’ order for expedited discovery, saying that the issue is a “narrow interpretative dispute” of what the word facilitate means that “does not require discovery.”After pushing back again, Xinis responded, “I just don’t think it’s that difficult. I think you want to make it that difficult because getting to the facts may not be that favorable.”Seized while looking for workAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization in 2011, fleeing violence in his home country of El Salvador, according to court records.Six years later while he was looking for work at a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, he was taken into custody by Prince George’s County Police Department.While there, he was questioned about gang affiliation and law enforcement did not believe he was not a member of the MS-13 gang, according to court records.The evidence officers submitted included Abrego Garcia wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, a hoodie and a statement from a confidential informant that stated he was a member of MS-13, according to court documents.While he was never charged with, or convicted of being, in a gang, he was kept in ICE detention while his case proceeded before an immigration judge.",,,,2025-04-15 19:08:59.029137

In-school violence educators and members of the criminal justice system gathered together during National Child Abuse Awareness Month to call attention to the importance of shining a light on violence against children so communities can respond more proactively to abuse.
Child abuse is not an issue, it’s a crisis, Senior Deputy Director for Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ (MDHHS) Children’s Services Administration Demetrius Starling told the crowd outside the Capitol.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowlege child abuse and neglect as “serious public health problems” which can have lifelong negative impacts on a person’s health and opportunities. Physical harm, psychological abuse and sexual violence are all forms of child abuse that impact hundreds of millions of children globally, according to the World Health Organization.
Child abuse is an every day problem that the adults in charge can’t afford to ignore, Starling said. About one in six of Michigan’s children experience abuse or neglect, according to Michigan state data.
“As a society, we have a moral obligation to protect children from harm. That’s not rocket science. Preventing child abuse is a collective responsibility that reflects our values and commitment to human rights. Children are the future for our communities, and ensuring that safety and well being is essential for the continued growth and development of our society,” Starling said. “Community awareness events play an important role in preventing child abuse and neglect by educating the public about available programs services and critical topics such as parent education.”
And those programs are being utilized, Starling said, noting that in 2024, the Michigan Children’s Trust Fund, a statewide nonprofit group funding child abuse prevention programming, partnered with community groups to organize 531 community awareness events which reached over 75,000 people.

Eliminating child abuse can’t simply be reactionary, though understanding the signs of abuse and neglect and reporting systems is valuable, Starling said. To truly fight child abuse, prevention has to be the focus.
And that can be hard to make people understand, Michigan Children’s Trust Fund Board Chair Amy Tattrie Loepp told attendees at the rally Tuesday.
“Prevention is a really tough thing to get funded, because how do you prove that something didn’t happen,” Tarrie Loepp said.

It’s easier to get programs that respond to violence funded than prevention measures, Loepp said, but ultimately empowering schools, communities and families to heal and learn how to end cycles of violence saves the state money in responding to violence and creates a society where the smallest Michiganders can live with better opportunities.

(Getty Images)Kentucky students are part of a federal lawsuit challenging U.S. Department of Defense policies that led to schools at Fort Campbell and other military bases removing books about slavery and civil rights. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is one of the defendants as lawyers ask the court to block Trump administration executive orders related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).
Filed in the United States District Court for Eastern Virginia Tuesday, the suit slams “system-wide censorship” that the plaintiffs say violates students’ First Amendment right to receive information. 
American Civil Liberties Union chapters in Kentucky and Virginia are joining the national ACLU in filing the suit on behalf of 12 students from six families.

Students in fourth grade, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten at Fort Campbell’s Barsanti Elementary School are among the plaintiffs. Other plaintiffs are enrolled in schools  in Virginia, Italy and Japan. They are among more than 67,000 students enrolled worldwide in schools run by the Department of Defense Education Activity.
Via executive order Trump directed schools receiving federal funding to not teach “ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals;” he also told the Armed Forces to dissolve DEI offices and directed all federal agencies to recognize only cisgender male and female identities.  
In February, Clarksville Now, a news outlet in Clarksville, Tennessee, reported Fort Campbell librarians were busy “scrubbing for books that contain references to slavery, the civil rights movement and anything else related to diversity, equity and inclusion” in compliance with Trump’s orders. 
Fort Campbell is an Army base than spans the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville and Clarksville.
Fort Campbell schools also had to remove “bulletin boards that reference Black History Month and Black leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks,” according to Clarksville Now. 
The ACLU lawsuit says Trump’s orders “censor references to slavery, civil rights, race, ethnicity, immigration, diversity, sexual orientation and gender identity.” 
“While the government has broad discretion to populate public school libraries  and create curricula, the First Amendment imposes guardrails to ensure removals are justified,” the brief says. “The government cannot suppress discussion of race and gender in public schools simply because a new  presidential administration finds certain viewpoints on those topics to be politically incorrect.” 
Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement that students “have a right to receive an education that includes an open and honest dialogue about America’s history.” 
“Censoring books and canceling assignments about the contributions of Black Americans is not only wrong, but antithetical to our First Amendment rights,” Shapiro said.
Being part of a military family does not erase students’ constitutional rights, said Emerson Sykes, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, in a Tuesday statement. Sykes said that Defense Department schools “are some of the most diverse and high achieving in the nation, making it particularly insulting to strip their shelves of diverse books and erase women, LGBTQ people, and people of color from the curriculum to serve a political goal. Our clients deserve better, and the First Amendment demands it.” 
The ACLU says the Department of Defense has prohibited cultural awareness months — including Black History Month, Pride Month, Women’s History Month and National Hispanic Heritage Month — and that books reportedly removed include “The Kite Runner” by Khaled Hosseini and “Hillbilly Elegy” by Vice President J.D. Vance, as well as a preparation guide for the Advanced Placement psychology exam. 
The Lantern has asked the Department of Defense Education Activity for a response to the lawsuit.
The nation’s military academies also are under pressure from Hegseth’s office to eliminate DEI, prompting the Naval Academy to remove almost 400 books from its libraries. The New York Times reports that Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” a memoir of growing up Black in America, was removed while two copies of Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” remain on the shelves in Annapolis.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s top-ranking state Republicans called a news conference in front of the governor’s mansion on Tuesday to celebrate yet another year of Utah ranking No. 1 for its economic outlook, according to a new report released by the pro “limited government” think tank American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). 
To Gov. Spencer Cox, House Speaker Mike Schultz and Senate President Stuart Adams, Utah taking the report’s top spot for 18 years in a row validates how Utah’s GOP-controlled Legislature has been managing the state, not just decades into the past, but also to this day.
By nurturing a business-friendly climate with low personal and corporate tax rates along with “family friendly” policies, they said Utah is continuing its nearly two-decade streak of setting an example for other states to follow. 
Alongside its No. 1 economic outlook ranking, Utah also ranked No. 3 in the nation in the ALEC report for “economic performance” based on its gross domestic product growth, domestic migration and non-farm payroll employment growth. 
It’s a ranking not all Utah leaders agree with, however, as some Democrats point to working class Utahns’ struggle to afford to live in the state.
Utah tops ALEC’s list of states with the best economic outlook, again

To Cox, Utah’s secret sauce is state leaders’ “forward-thinking nature” on economic, business and tax policy that fosters growth over decades — work that he said isn’t easy or “sexy” in today’s polarized political landscape. And it’s work that takes years, sometimes decades, to have an impact. 
“As I talk to my colleagues around the country, this is really rare,” Cox said. “It’s very unique. The incentive structure around elections is to only look forward maybe two years or four years at most in our state. And that is true of most states.” 
The governor said there’s a “pull” to focus today’s legislation in reaction to national hot-button issues. Without naming names, he said he spoke with a fellow governor from “a state that is very close to ours” who said “the biggest problem I have with my Legislature right now is they only care about right now.”
“One of the reasons that a lot of states aren’t doing the policy work that our Legislature is doing is because it’s hard and it’s boring,” he said. “There are not a lot of great social media memes about policy work that was done 40 years ago, (like) truth and taxation stuff. This stuff isn’t sexy. It’s not fun. You don’t see immediate results the next year, it’s just not made for today.” 
Utah isn’t immune to that “pull,” Cox acknowledged. Political “toxicity” is among the concerns he named that could threaten Utah’s economic ranking, which he said could “turn us into every other state, where we just focus on the stuff that really doesn’t matter but gets the most attention.” 
“I will just tell you, there are a lot of new legislators who came in not interested in this stuff,” Cox said. “(They’re) really interested in a lot of other stuff that gets a lot of attention. And we have to be intentional about passing that on and making sure that every generation (of leaders), they realize that this is who we are. This stuff matters and we have to keep going.”

He also named the state’s stubbornly high housing costs and energy challenges as other issues that could spell trouble — but he also expressed optimism that the Utah Legislature is working to tackle those problems, not shy away. 
Cox didn’t point to specific issues or legislators, but in recent years some of Utah’s most attention-grabbing and controversial bills stem from national hot-button issues. Last year, the Legislature approved transgender bathroom restrictions and anti-DEI measures in higher education and public entities. This year, Utah became the first state in the nation to enact a broad flag ban in schools and government-owned buildings and the first to ban adding fluoride to public water. Cox supported and signed the fluoride ban, but allowed the flag ban to become law without his signature. 
An ALEC-backed bill, however, was among the most controversial to win approval from the 2025 Utah Legislature: HB267 which bans public sector unions from collective bargaining. In a Feb. 19 post, ALEC deemed the bill’s sponsors “policy champions” for their effort to “increase government accountability to state taxpayers.” But a referendum effort is underway to overturn the law. Wednesday, the Protect Utah Workers Coalition is expected to deliver its signatures in its bid to put the referendum on the ballot. 
Why does Utah rank No. 1?
For its annual “Rich States, Poor States” rankings, ALEC — a nonprofit that convenes state legislators and corporations to draft model legislation that is “dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets and federalism,” according to its site — said its economic outlook rankings are a forecast based on state standings in 15 policy variables. 
“Generally speaking, states that spend less — especially on income transfer programs — and states that tax less — particularly on productive activities such as working or investing — experience higher growth rates than states that tax and spend more,” the 2025 report says. 
Utah ranked high for its lack of an estate or inheritance tax, a low state minimum wage of $7.25, its status as a right-to-work state, and average workers’ compensation costs of $0.86. It also won points for “recently legislated tax changes” (lawmakers this year cut taxes for a fifth year in a row, totaling $1.4 billion over time), its flat corporate and income rate of 4.55%, and a relatively low property tax burden of $23.54 per $1,000 of personal income, among other policies.  
Utah Legislature OKs another round of tax cuts, totaling $1.4 billion in 5 years

Adams, the state’s Senate president, also pointed to a newly published report by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute that shows Utah’s median household income of $98,336 ranked the state highest in the U.S. when adjusted for price parity.  
“I mean, how can you get better than being the No. 1 economy with the best personal income?” Adams, R-Layton said. “You have families making a lot of money. And that is way cool. They can send their kids to college.” 
Though critics often point to Utah’s bottom-of-the-nation rankings when it comes to per-pupil education spending, Adams said the state has been increasing public education spending, including a boost to teacher pay this year that legislative leaders say put Utah among the top states in the Mountain West with the highest starting salaries for teachers.
“We’re cutting taxes and paying teachers more. How do you do that without a strong economy? … Not many states can do both,” Adams said. “It’s a great day, not only for the state of Utah, but it is a really good day for those that want to have personal wealth and be able to take care of their families.”
Don’t let economic ranking ‘cloud over our shortfalls,’ top Democrat says
Not everyone agrees that ALEC’s rankings are a holistic indicator of Utah’s performance as a state. One of the state’s top Democrats, House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, issued a statement on Tuesday arguing that ALEC’s report “provides a concerningly biased evaluation of economic success in our state.” 
“Rather than accounting for factors that affect regular working people and families, the index praises Utah for its low minimum wage and tax cuts in favor of corporations,” she said. 
That’s problematic given that wages have not kept pace with cost of living, Romero said. She added that economic uncertainty under President Donald Trump’s second administration could bring more stress for businesses and working-class families. 
“Rising housing costs, increasing prices on basic necessities, and stagnant wages have left countless Utahns struggling to make ends meet in the very communities they’ve called home for generations,” she said. “On top of that, federal layoffs and our current economic uncertainty have forced businesses to make difficult decisions, resulting in even more financial stress for working families across the state. All of this compounds a growing sense of fear and frustration.”

Romero added that “although we celebrate these rankings, we must not allow them to cloud over our shortfalls.”
“Utah has consistently ranked among the lowest states for women’s equality, and is regularly listed among the ten worst states for workers, with particularly poor outcomes in wages, collective bargaining rights, and labor protections,” she said. “As a state, we must protect the economic outlook for all Utahns, not only a select few.”
For years, though, Utah’s conservative leadership has applauded ALEC’s rankings as a gold standard. 
Schultz, the House speaker, said ALEC’s ranking shows Utah’s success is “rooted in the principles that work: low taxes, reasonable spending, and a business-friendly but most importantly a family-friendly environment that fosters innovation and upward mobility.” 
“It’s capitalism, it’s competition,” Adams said. “It’s trying to make things better. I have 16 grandkids. Talk about vision. I want those 16 grandkids to have better upward mobility, to have a better life than I have. … That’s what we do in Utah. Competition is a great thing, and I look forward to other states pushing us.” 
A rising competitor 
In that spirit of competition, Cox, Adams and Schultz chuckled when Jonathan Williams, ALEC president and co-author of the report, noted that one state is on the rise and could be giving Utah a run for its money in coming years: Tennessee. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We saw Tennessee this year move from No. 12 to No. 2, and now is nipping at the heels of Utah,” he said.  
Tennessee ranked high for its lack of a personal income tax, no estate tax, its low property tax burden, and “personal income tax progressivity,” which the report defined as the difference between average tax liability per $1,000 at incomes of $50,000 and $150,000.” 
Utah leaders have repeatedly said they want Utah to get rid of its income tax — but that would require a major tax overhaul legislators have not yet tackled, and a drastic change to how the state funds public education, which is required under the Utah Constitution to be funded through income tax revenue. In the meantime, though, lawmakers continue to gradually cut the income tax rate. 
Speaking about Utah’s competition with other states, though, Cox said he’s happy to see Tennessee surface as a healthy competitor. “They deserve it. I love what they’re doing out there.” He added that the state is “copying many things that are happening in Utah, and I couldn’t be more proud.” 
He added Utah leaders “reject the zero-sum mindset. We do not believe that our economy is a zero-sum game, that if someone else wins, we lose. That’s not how we look at it.” 
Still, the governor indicated Utah will continue to look for ways to keep its No. 1 ALEC ranking.
He half-jokingly said at the end of Tuesday’s news conference, “We’re going to take care of Tennessee. Don’t worry.”

Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, testifies against a bill that sought to authorize the State Investment Board to divest the Legacy Fund from Chinese investments. (Jeff Beach / North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate on Tuesday sank a bill that would have authorized the State Investment Board to divest from Legacy Fund holdings in companies headquartered  in China.
Under the “prudent investor rule,” which governs trustees of investment portfolios, the board must prefer “qualified investment firms and financial institutions with a presence in the state.” It cannot choose not to favor a company purely based on its home country.
The bill, which failed by a 20-26 vote, would have updated this language to let the board voluntarily cut ties with Chinese businesses.
Bill requiring Legacy Fund disclosure website sees support in North Dakota Legislature

According to the North Dakota Retirement and Investment Office, that applies to only about  $246 million of the $12 billion in the fund. That equates to about 2.1%
Primary sponsor Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, has said North Dakota should do away with holdings in Chinese companies due to human rights abuses committed by the Chinese Communist Party, as well as concerns that China’s government is a national security threat to the United States.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, said he supported the bill because it addresses these problems while still giving the State Investment Board flexibility over the fund’s investments.
“Our own intelligence agency has identified that there are significant threats that come from the Chinese Communist Party,” he said on the Senate floor.
North Dakota Legacy Fund takes big hit amid stock market volatility

Critics of the bill said it would hamper growth of the Legacy Fund by discouraging investment in an entire country’s market.
Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, said it’s unusual for North Dakota to single out countries in state law. 
The closest comparison may be a 2023 law the North Dakota Legislature adopted prohibiting investment practices that would result in a boycott of Israel.
Klein said many Chinese companies are good-faith business partners to the United States and shouldn’t be penalized just because of where they’re located. 
The Retirement and Investment Board took a neutral stance on the bill.
Earlier this month, the Senate passed another Legacy Fund-related policy, House Bill 1319, which requires the Retirement and Investment Office to create a website detailing Legacy Fund holdings. Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed the bill into law last week.

“Given Mr. [James] Uthmeier’s involvement in the settlement and then the transfer to Hope Florida and the soliciting these grant proposals and then immediately receiving that to his PAC, yeah,” Andrade told reporters after the meeting when asked whether the transactions might be criminal.
“That’s very much what it looks like. But again, I’m not a prosecutor,” Andrade said.

Andrade, who is an attorney, told reporters following a lengthy meeting of the House Health Care Budget Committee, which he chairs, that while he plans on calling a spate of others to testify before the committee next week, the job may be getting too large for his budget subcommittee to handle. 
Indeed, Andrade on social media pushed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office to investigate the transfer of the funds. Medicaid is a health care safety net program for the poor elderly and disabled that is funded with both state and federal dollars.
“I don’t want to guess whether or not she will or not,” he said about Bondi’s potential involvement. “At this point, though, given what we keep turning over and finding out every time I flip over a rock and find something new, this feels way bigger than a subcommittee.”
Tuesday’s House hearing represented an almost unthinkable moment, another escalation of a feud between the governor and House Republicans. It occurred as DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis, who initiated Hope Florida in 2021, held a press conference in Pensacola, in Andrade’s House district, where the governor railed against House Republicans and said they were pushing a “hoax” with Democrats and the “liberal media.”
DeSantis suggested that the First Lady, widely thought to be considering a gubernatorial run in 2026, was being targeted because of her strength as a candidate.
“And look, some people feel threatened by the First Lady, let’s be clear about that. You saw her up here. If you are looking at 2026, and you’ve got some horse, you don’t want her anywhere near that. You are very worried, because she runs circles around their people. Everybody knows that,” DeSantis said.
Andrade, though, denied that was the case.
“I never mentioned Casey in any of this. I mean,  you know, if I was in town I would have gone to it, although it sounds as if I wasn’t invited,” Andrade said. “You know, I hope you had a fun time in my district. I’m really proud to represent it.”
Money transfer
The question is how a $10 million payment from a state-contracted Medicaid managed care plan wound up in the hands of two groups that turned around and gave money to the group battling last year’s marijuana amendment.
The DeSantis administration organized opposition to that and the abortion-rights amendment using state resources. Both proposals were broadly popular but fell narrowly short of the requited 60% approval rate.
DeSantis’ anti-pot committee, Keep Florida Clean, was run by Uthmeier, then DeSantis’ chief of staff, whom the governor subsequently appointed state attorney general following Ashley Moody’s departure for the U.S. Senate.
The $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation was part of a larger $67 million settlement the state reached with the giant contractor Centene stemming from Medicaid overpayments involving the  delivery of pharmacy benefits and services. Uthmeir was a signatory to the settlement agreement. 
Meet the players
The committee met for more than three hours, questioning Joshua Hay, president of the Hope Florida Foundation; Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch; and Erik Dellenback, who serves as the Governor’s Liaison for Faith & Community and executive director of Hope Florida in the Executive Office of the Governor.
Hope Florida, according to its website, is a government initiative that serves as a connection point between the public and private sector, faith-based communities, and nonprofits. Hope “navigators” work at agencies across state government with people seeking assistance in transitioning from government benefits to economic self-sufficiency.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the not-for-profit direct-support organization that assists the Department of Children and Families with Hope Florida.
The foundation has failed to submit an annual audit to the state’s auditor general, has no code of ethics for its members to follow, and has failed to file tax returns.










This feels way bigger than a subcommittee.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


Hay, whose position with the foundation is voluntary, was sworn in before testifying. Andrade explained that Hatch and Dellenback weren’t sworn in because they are state employees and thus are expected to provide truthful testimony.
In addition to serving as the Hope Florida Foundation chair, Hay is the founder of the management consulting firm Indelible Solutions, which he testified operates in 23 states and has millions of dollars in contracts with the state of Florida.
Hay, joined by his legal counsel, Mark Herron, said the foundation board of directors plans a meeting Thursday and will address the delinquent paperwork.
He testified that he’s been working for about a month with Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, who frequently represents the state in lawsuits and advises Keep Florida Clean, and who is advising Hope Florida on the requisite paperwork. 
Hay said that attorney Jeff Aaron advised him to work with Jazil on the paperwork. Aaron is a Republican attorney who successfully defended the governor in the lawsuit filed by suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren. 
The testimony didn’t sit well with Andrade.
“Jeff Aaron connected you with Mohammad Jazil, the attorney for Keep Florida Clean, to help Hope Florida’s foundation in complying with the paperwork, to retroactively justify this payment. Is that what I am hearing right now? Members, I am sorry, I am a little flabbergasted at this revelation.”
Hay also testified that the Hope Florida Foundation generally awards grants to individuals and organizations in the $1,500 to $2,500 range. It made two $5 million payments to Secure Florida’s Future and Save Our Society from Drugs.
Hay acknowledged that those payments were made without approval by the board of directors.
Trickle down effects

Although the upper chamber has stayed out of the House’s probe into Hope Florida, the developments led Senate President Ben Albritton on Tuesday to “take a pause at this point” on a bill cementing the program in the governor’s office, said Katherine Betta, a spokesperson for Albritton.
“State government should be about continuous improvement. When things are not as transparent as we would like, or as they should be, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, but we should improve and look for opportunities to do better moving forward,” Albritton said in a prepared statement.
Still, scrutiny over Hope Florida seeped into a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government Tuesday.
Democratic and Republican senators raised concerns over SB 820, which would formalize in statute the Office of Faith and Community, because of Dellenback’s leadership positions in both the faith office and Hope Florida. 
“I don’t dislike it enough to vote no on it, but I am very concerned. I think we need to think carefully now that more information has come forward in this own committee meeting,” Winter Haven Republican Sen. Colleen Burton said. “I think we need to be very, very careful that if we do enshrine this in statute, that this office stands on its own two feet, that it’s not associated with other organizations.” 
Filed by Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough, the bill passed with three “no” votes, all cast by Democrats, and advanced to its final committee stop. The House companion, HB 293, is awaiting its final committee hearing.

(Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)State universities are planning to increase tuition for undergraduate and graduate students once again this fall, pending approval from the Iowa Board of Regents, according to board documents released Tuesday.
If approved by the board at its June meeting, University of Iowa and Iowa State University resident undergraduate students will see their tuition increase by 3%, with a proposed 2.7% increase for in-state, undergraduate students attending the University of Northern Iowa. The regents will consider the proposals at their April 23-24 meeting on the ISU campus.
UNI is the only state university to propose a larger tuition increase rate than last year. Both the UI and ISU had 3% increases in the 2024-2025 school year while UNI tuition increased by 2%.
Out-of-state undergraduate students will also see their tuition increase, according to the proposed rates document. The proposed rate increase of 0.9% from the UI is the only one coming in lower than resident increases. ISU requested a 4.5% increase for nonresident students and UNI requested 3%.
“Funding from the proposed tuition increases will help address growing financial challenges,” the document stated, “including inflationary cost increases, recruiting and retaining faculty and staff in national markets, health care, meeting collective bargaining terms, deferred maintenance needs in academic facilities, and student financial aid to provide higher education opportunities to more students.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Each of the state universities has proposed a 3% tuition increase for resident graduate students. ISU proposed the same increase for nonresident graduate students, while UNI requested 1.4% and the UI requested 1.1%.
Certain undergraduate and graduate programs will request their own tuition rate increases or freezes for the upcoming year. One proposal from UNI would have the university offer applicants in neighboring states a slightly lower rate than what will be standard for out-of-state students.
Multiple programs in the UI Carver College of Medicine have proposed keeping tuition flat for the 2025-2026 academic year for out-of-state or all students, including master’s programs in athletic training and clinical nutrition and the doctor of physical therapy degree. The MD program in the college of medicine, which the document stated has been in a tuition freeze for the past five years, is requesting a 3% increase across the board and the physician’s assistant program is asking for a 4% increase for residents and 3% for non-resident students.
The UI radiation sciences program is asking for a $703 increase for all students in order to complete its three-year tuition plan to reach a balanced budget, according to the document.
“The program is essential to SUI’s mission and the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, as it provides healthcare personnel in the areas of diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy,” the document stated. “There are critical shortages of these healthcare personnel.”
Students in ISU’s veterinary medicine program could see tuition increases to the tune of 3.5% for residents and 3% for nonresidents, according to the program’s request. In order to align the tuition of sophomores with that of juniors and seniors in the ISU Ivy College of Business, the university is asking for a $1,412 increase for residents and $2,644 for out-of-state students to complete the third year of increases.
Each of the universities will also propose increases to mandatory fees, totaling 3% for the UI, 2.7% for UNI and 1.7% for ISU.
“The proposed tuition rates at all three universities combined are projected to generate $42 million in incremental revenue for FY 2026, approximately 2.4% of the current total general education fund operating budget,” the document stated.
These increases would bring the total cost of attendance, including room and board and other expenses, to $29,958 at the UI, $25,950.90 at ISU and $24,017 at UNI.
When compared to their peer universities, each of Iowa’s public colleges are at or below average for both resident and nonresident tuition and fee costs, according to the document. UI tuition and fees for out-of-state-students are the lowest of its peer group, coming in at $33,371 compared to the average $42,157.

The remaining four cases were in Lea County, where the majority of the outbreak has spread in New Mexico, bringing the measles total to 63 cases. Five of those cases were serious enough to warrant hospitalization.
The New Mexico Department of Health officials recommended Tuesday that parents seek one dose of the measles, mumps rubella vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months living in Doña Ana County, or who will be traveling to either Doña Ana or Lea counties.
“Given how contagious measles is, we expected it to find its way from El Paso County in Texas to neighboring Doña Ana County,” said NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham in a written statement. “No matter where you live in New Mexico, make sure you and your family are up to date with your vaccinations.”
Health officials said measles exposure may have occurred in the past two weeks at the following dates and locations:

April 2: noon to 6 p.m. at Kid’s Kountry Place Preschool and Childcare, 3704 Elk’s Drive
April 3 and April 7: 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Family Medicine Center, 2605 Terrace Drive
April 6: 1 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Emergency Department, 2450 S. Telshor Blvd.
April 7: 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Family Medicine Center, 2605 Terrace Drive
April 8: 7:45 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Memorial Medical Center Emergency Department and Pediatric unit, 2450 S. Telshor Blvd.

NMDOH requests that anyone exposed or showing symptoms call the measles Helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for help in English or Spanish for vaccine questions or further measles testing. They urged patients to contact doctor’s offices or emergency rooms before coming in to allow them to prepare for a potential measles case.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, spread through contact with airborne droplets from infected people. People can spread the measles days before symptoms show, which include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a red spotty rash starting on the head and face and spreading over the body.
The most effective prevention against the measles is two doses of the vaccine, according to health officials.
New Mexico’s vaccination rate has more than doubled between Feb. 1 and April 14, with 18,449 vaccinations this year over the 9,863 in the same time period in 2024.
In addition to the 10 walk-in vaccine clinics in eight counties posted to the website, NMDOH announced two additional locations in Las Cruces:

Walk-in vaccine hours are from 1 to 3 p.m. Mondays from 1 to 3 p.m. and 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Friday mornings at the Las Cruces Public Health Office, 1170 N. Solano Drive. (575) 528-5001.
From 10 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesdays at Las Cruces East Mesa Public Health Office, 5220 Holman Road. (575) 382-0540.

In other parts of the state, cases remain unchanged at two infections reported in Eddy County and one infection in Chaves County. Nearly 60% of New Mexico’s measles cases have impacted children, with 17 cases reported in very young children; 19 cases in children ages 7 to 17-years old; and 27 cases in adults.
Texas Health officials reported 20 additional cases Tuesday, totaling 561 cases in 23 counties. The majority of cases remain in Gaines County, which has one of the lowest childhood vaccination rates in Texas.
The U.S. has more than twice the number of measles cases reported in 2024.
Three reported measles deaths have occurred during the outbreak: two Texas children, and one Lea County adult, which is still under investigation, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator.

Coba, a State Law Enforcement Division dog, was shot and killed June 11 while officers served a warrant.
Wick, a Richland County Sheriff’s dog, was struck by a car June 20 while chasing a suspect across a highway.

Coba was one of five police dogs killed in the line of duty last year, an all-time high for the state, according to Officer Down, which tracks law enforcement deaths.
A bill senators advanced to the floor Tuesday by a unanimous vote would increase the potential fines and prison time for anyone who kills or injures a police dog or horse in South Carolina.
The existing penalty for killing a police dog or horse is up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. That’s not nearly enough to show the state is serious about protecting its police dogs, said Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott.
His department lost three police dogs in the line of duty last year, the most of any county.
“Unfortunately, the penalty for killing these dogs, for injuring these dogs, is very minimal,” Lott said.
Under the proposal, killing a four-legged officer could come with a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $20,000. Injuring one would be punishable by up to five years in prison and $5,000 fine.
“This protection is what’s deserved for these canines,” said John Blackmon, president of the South Carolina Fraternal Order of Police. “We owe them a debt, and this protection is that debt.”
Police dogs often save the lives of police officers by going into situations too dangerous for a person or pulling attention away from their handlers, law enforcement officers said.
Lott pointed to Sgt. Warren Cavanagh, who credits his Belgian Malinois, Fargo, with saving his life by taking bullets meant for him during a 2011 shootout. Fargo was the first police dog killed in the state, Lott said.
Police dogs can sniff out drugs and explosives, find the source of arson and take down suspects on the run, said Greenville Sheriff Hobart Lewis. They typically live with their handlers, allowing them to bond both on and off the clock, he said.
“These dogs are certainly more than just a tool,” Lewis said. “They’re law enforcement officers. In our case, they’re deputies. They’re partners. They’re family.”
The dogs are not like other pets, Lewis said. They go through a strict selection process and upwards of 600 hours of training to get ready for duty, he said.
That means the dogs are costly to replace. A dog straight out of handler school — not even fully trained for duty — costs at least $12,500, Lewis said. Other law enforcement agencies, such as Horry County, have reported spending as much as $18,000 for a single police dog, according to a review of the bill by the state’s fiscal experts.
“These animals represent a significant investment of time, money and training,” Lewis said.
Law enforcement officers have seen an increase in violence directed toward police dogs in the past year, officers told the committee. Along with the record number of dogs killed, law enforcement agencies have had an unknown number of dogs hurt while on duty, Lewis said.
Among them was Micky, a Greenville County police dog stabbed repeatedly while deputies attempted to serve a warrant last June, Lewis said.
“These aren’t rare cases anymore,” Lewis said. “They are becoming more and more common, and that should alarm us all.”
As a police officer in Goose Creek and North Charleston, Sen. Brian Adams knew to stay behind the police dogs when they were on assignment together. He was afraid of what he knew they could do, but he also saw how much they helped their handlers, said Adams, the bill’s sponsor.
“They are a great tool and a great partner for our canine handlers,” the Goose Creek Republican said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/leon-lott-1024x497.jpg,,,2025-04-15 18:11:18.312706

Jane Doe, who is concealing her name because of the sensitive nature of the allegations, filed the lawsuit Monday in Taney County Circuit Court. She is represented by the same attorneys who represented Logan Yandell, another survivor of Newman’s abuse.
Newman worked for the Branson-based Christian summer camp for over two decades. He was director of Kanakuk’s “K-Kountry” camp for ages 6 to 11 in 2009 before he was fired and later convicted of sexual abuse. Newman initially pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual abuse, but the case’s prosecutor estimated the number of survivors to be in the hundreds.
Doe was nine years old when she attended K-Kountry in 2008. She was placed in a cabin with older girls and was “bullied” and “taunted,” according to the lawsuit.
She met Newman, who began to “isolate her away from other campers.” He forced Doe into sexual acts, the lawsuit alleges, and told her “if she didn’t do such acts or (if she) said anything to anyone, she would not get to go home.”
Doe repressed what happened until 2024, when the memories came back. She began to question camp leadership’s responsibility in causing “severe emotional trauma.”
The timing of the discovery is important in personal injury claims. Missouri law limits claims to five years from the incident or five years from discovery of the injury, in some cases.
A Christian County Circuit Court judge ruled against Yandell in January in a fraud case he brought against Kanakuk alleged the camp’s CEO lied to his parents and pushed them to sign a settlement and non-disclosure agreement for $250,000 that they otherwise would have continued to fight. The judge ruled Yandell should have known about the camp’s misstatements more than five years prior to his lawsuit.
Newman’s abuse has been well documented, with reports in local and national news outlets and a page on Kanankuk’s website acknowledging the abuse and naming Newman a “master of deception.”
But according to Doe’s lawsuit, Kanakuk leaders knew about Newman’s misdeeds years before she attended camp. Parents had told the camp as far back as 1999 that Newman was behaving inappropriately, such as swimming and four-wheeling nude.
Years prior to Doe’s abuse, Newman’s supervisor recommended that he be fired, the lawsuit says. Instead, he was promoted in 2005.
In 2006, Kanakuk CEO Joe White learned that Newman was “ministering” to children in the evenings in his hot tub, the lawsuit states.
“White felt this was enough of a problem to issue a corrective action. The correction, however, was not to prohibit hot tub encounters, but merely an encouragement to Newman to assess the amount of time he was spending with his family,” says the lawsuit.
White and the camp had a duty to protect campers after repeated reports of sexual abuse, Doe’s attorney Reed Martens argues.
“Despite having explicit knowledge of the particular sexual danger Newman posed to (Doe) prior to the onset of his abuse,” Martens wrote, “Kanakuk defendants did nothing to supervise Newman’s interactions with (Doe), nothing to control Newman and nothing to protect (Doe).”

To our community, our message is that you're not alone, you have rights, seek legal guidance, and you're not obligated to provide information that can hurt you or your family.”Under Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the administration has sent “innocent people” to detention facilities at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, Salas said.The administration has detained immigrants of all legal statuses without due process, and ignored court orders to reverse those actions. Advocates on the press call Tuesday said that defies the law.Immigrants, even without legal status in the country, are “entitled to their day in immigration court,” Nicole Melaku, the executive director of National Partnership for New Americans, said.The directive, which requires immigrants who have registered with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to always carry with them proof of their registration, would also lead to racial profiling of U.S. citizens, advocates have said.No reported registrantsSalas said her organization, which is based in Southern California, does not know of anyone who has completed the registration.The people who are required to register are unclear about whether it is in their interest to comply, and distrust of Trump – who campaigned on an anti-immigration platform and has routinely flouted due process for immigrants – is a major obstacle.“We don't have anybody who has – that we know – yet registered,” she said. “There's a lot of confusion in our community as to whether to do this or not. What does it mean? What are the risks? And I also want to say that … everything that has come from this administration has actually been harmful, so people are taking that into account.”Legal fight continuingU.S. Judge Trevor Neil McFadden, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench in 2017, rejected advocacy groups’ attempt to block the directive, saying in an order last week that the groups hadn’t shown they’d been harmed by it.But the legal fight against the directive will continue, George Escobar, the chief of programs and services at the immigrant services organization CASA, said.In addition to a possible appeal of McFadden’s ruling, Escobar said his organizations would watch “very, very closely” how the administration conducts the operation, with special attention to racial profiling, and would not hesitate to bring court challenges.“We will do everything possible to fight this,” he said. “This may be a show-me-your-papers type of situation where people may be racially profiled, stopped on the street just because they're speaking in other languages, because they look like an immigrant, and has to be asked to show this registration compliance.”Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday.",,,,2025-04-15 18:11:18.312706

Regarding crime, his website says that the Rio Rancho Police budget “has more than doubled” during Hull’s tenure as mayor “and the city has been consistently ranked one of the safest cities in New Mexico.” The Rio Rancho Observer earlier this year noted an increase in homicides in 2024 in Rio Rancho, but also made Livability’s list of the top 25 best places to live in the Southwest.
Regarding crime, which has been a focal point for Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham — who is term-limited from running again — Hull says his priorities will include: increasing police presence throughout the state; enhancing border security to “end the fentanyl crisis”; and establishing a “zero-tolerance policy for all violent crimes and crimes against children.”
He is the first Republican to announce a gubernatorial run in 2026, and prompted a swift response from state Democratic Party spokesperson Daniel Garcia: “Under Democratic leadership, New Mexico has been a national leader in protecting abortion rights and reproductive healthcare, transitioning to a clean energy economy, early childhood education, and much more,” Garcia said in a statement. “New Mexicans can’t risk reversing our progress in so many key areas by having a Republican Trump lackey as the top executive in our state. It has taken years to recover from the profoundly negative effect New Mexico’s last Republican governor had on our state.”
So far, the Democratic primary for governor has two official candidates: Former Interior Secretary and Congresswoman Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County DA Sam Bregman.
According to their most recent campaign finance reports, Hull has raised just shy of $200,000; Bregman has raised approximately $632,000 and Haaland has raised more than $2.8 million.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gregghull-1024x412.jpeg,,,2025-04-15 18:11:18.312706

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)Indiana Supreme Court justices on Tuesday set a May 20 execution date for death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
The high court’s decision followed a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by Ritchie and his legal team. The inmate’s request for post-conviction relief was denied in Tuesday’s 13-page order, penned by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, although she disagreed with the decision in her opinion.
Included in the death row inmate’s post-conviction filings are claims that his trial and post-conviction counsel “provided ineffective assistance” by not investigating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and by failing to “analyze the effect of Ritchie’s childhood exposure to excessive amounts of lead.”
Additionally, counsel emphasized that Ritchie was only 20 years old at the time of the crime, and “recent developments in the law” require the state supreme court to consider his age at sentencing. Ritchie’s team held, too, that the state “engaged in prosecutorial misconduct” throughout his jury trial.
Indiana justices weigh in
Justices said Ritchie “has not persuaded a majority of the Court that there is a reasonable possibility he is entitled to relief,” however.
Even so, Rush said she believed evidence submitted to the court suggests “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered William Toney, the police officer, in 2000.
Story continues below.
Order – SPCR and execution date
 
She noted that Ritchie has recently been evaluated by two FASD experts. Rush preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the experts’ evaluations.
“If those evaluations both confirm that Ritchie suffers from FASD and explain its effect on his behavior when he committed his crimes, a successive petition for post-conviction relief would be authorized,” the chief justice wrote in her opinion. 
But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter disagreed with Rush. 
“… what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant. The issue before us is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today; it is whether his trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then,” Slaughter wrote. 
“On this claim, Ritchie cannot show a ‘reasonable possibility’ of relief,” the justice continued. “Even if he suffered from FASD in 2000, as he now claims for the first time, he did not preserve that claim, so it is procedurally defaulted. And he cannot avoid his default of this claim because his counsel were not ineffective under either standard for assessing counsel’s performance.”
Justice Christopher Goff dissented, in part, saying he “would have temporarily stayed the execution date to consider Ritchie’s claim.”
Justice Mark Massa did not weigh in.
Next steps could bring clemency hearings
When asked to comment, Ritchie’s defense attorneys told the Indiana Capital Chronicle only that they’re “considering next steps,” which is likely to include a clemency petition.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.

The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The five-member board, specifically, is responsible for conducting an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition. 
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita — whose office requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall — told the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that he had been “expecting” an execution date, and that “everything is going to plan.” 
If and when Ritchie files for clemency, Rokita said “we’ll continue on like we do with any other one.”
“Nothing’s changing our plans or procedures based for this fellow versus the last,” he said.
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who did not survive the shooting.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
 Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Tuesday the state has submitted a waiver to the federal government to implement work requirements for Iowans on the state’s expanded Medicaid program.
The governor directed the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to seek a waiver to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for work requirements, according to a Tuesday news release — an effort she announced she would take action on at the beginning of the 2025 legislative session.
The news release Tuesday stated the waiver reflects the legislation being considered by Iowa lawmakers, Senate File 615. The bill has been approved by both chambers, but the Senate must approve an amendment from the House before it goes to the governor.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP, the state’s expanded Medicaid program, provides health coverage to able-bodied Iowans from ages 19 to 64 with household incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. There are exceptions to the proposed work requirements, including for people who are considered medically frail or medically exempt under Medicaid , adults caring for a child under age 6 and people in substance abuse treatment programs for up to six months.
The bill proposes that non-exempt IHAWP recipients work at least 80 hours each month to be eligible for health coverage. According to the Iowa HHS proposal, the governor’s waiver proposal sets a 100-hour per month requirement for individuals to remain eligible for coverage. If the federal waiver is rejected under the legislation, the state would be required to end the expanded Medicaid program for all recipients, regardless of whether they are working.
Reynolds said in a statement that she has prioritized ensuring Iowa’s government programs “reflect a culture of work.”
“If you are an able-bodied adult who can work, you should work,” Reynolds said. “We need to return Medicaid back to its core purpose — to provide coverage to the people who truly need it.”
The state estimated that nearly 100,000 individuals currently on IHAWP report having no income, according to the governor’s news release.
The Legislative Services Agency estimated 142,000 of the 181,000 Iowans currently on IHAWP would be subject to work requirements under the Medicaid work requirements bill, and that 32,000 Iowans would likely lose the health coverage if the legislation is implemented. Democratic lawmakers have argued work requirements will result in higher costs to the state, by pushing health care costs from low-income individuals currently on IHAWP to other areas of the state’s health care system.
There will be two public hearings for the waiver — the first at Urbandale Public Library on April 23 at 10:30 a.m., and the second at Marshalltown Public Library on April 29 at 2 p.m., with both meetings available for remote access via Zoom.

(Courtesy of Provo City)About 50 miles from Utah’s capital airport is a small hub that some travelers on the Wasatch Front turn to for ultra-low-cost carriers — the Provo airport. In 2024, about 900,000 passengers used the airport’s four gates to board domestic flights. It was a record-setting number for the facility. However, as soon as this year that number could multiply.
Provo City broke ground for an airport expansion on Monday. The plans are to build an extended apron, increasing parking capacity for aircraft by November, according to a news release from the city.
One of the most substantial changes, however, is scheduled to open by late 2028 — the facility’s expansion to host 10 gates in total.
“Thanks to American Airlines’ frequent daily flights to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Phoenix-Sky Harbor (PHX), travelers from PVU now enjoy easy access to over 270 global destinations, both domestic and international,” Brian Torgersen, Provo Airport director, said in the release. “And the connectivity will only improve with our expansion from four gates to ten gates.”
The funding is secured and the demand is growing, the release reads, especially with major events on the state’s horizon. The project’s price tag is $80 million, according to a presentation filed to the Legislature, which will be paid by different programs from the Federal Aviation Administration, the state, Utah County, Mountainland Association of Governments, and Provo City.
This year, lawmakers also approved a one-time payment of $4.5 million to support the project.
“This expansion positions PVU not just as a regional airport, but as a vital part of Utah’s growing transportation network — ready to welcome the world, including visitors for the 2034 Winter Olympics,” Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi said in a statement.

But plans will continue beyond this development. By summer 2026, the airport is also scheduled to have a master plan for another two decades.
Utah County pledged $78 million to help fund the expansion, including a $19.5 million up-front payment gathered with a tourism tax, and an annual contribution of $3.9 million for the next 15 years, according to a Utah County news release. The investment would contribute to the gates’ expansion, as well as efforts to grow baggage handling and ticketing areas, and prepare it for international travel.
“This expansion is more than just bricks and mortar — it’s a bold step into the future,” Utah County Commissioner Amelia Powers Gardner said in the release. “We’re building infrastructure that not only meets today’s needs but sets the stage for tomorrow’s growth, global events, and economic opportunity.”

Patrick Morrisey signed Senate Bill 199 into law at Ripley Elementary School in Ripley, W.Va. on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. The bill allows teachers to remove disruptive students from their classrooms. (West Virginia Office of the Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia elementary school teachers have spent the last few years asking lawmakers for help addressing an uptick in violent and disruptive student behavior that includes punching, kicking and classroom destruction. On Monday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill aiming to give teachers more control over their classrooms.
“We want our teachers teaching — not babysitting, not disciplining,” Morrisey said during a bill signing event at Ripley Elementary School in Ripley, West Virginia.
The measure, Senate Bill 199, also mandates that school mental health professionals assess removed students to see what could be causing the behavior. 
The most violent attacks on elementary teachers are occurring most frequently in kindergarten classrooms. Educators say the problem is linked to the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis, and kids are arriving at preschool or kindergarten dealing with trauma, neglect or behavioral issues as a result of neonatal abstinence syndrome.
Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, is a fourth grader teacher who spent two years working on the bill after it failed to make it to the governor’s desk last year. 
“The most important part is that we want to make sure that you guys always have a safe classroom and a safe learning environment to learn in and that your teachers have a safe environment to teach in,” Grady told Ripley Elementary students.
Addressing student discipline has been a top ask from teachers across the state as they say student behavior is worsening and data shows suspensions are increasing. Some lawmakers have said they must address the issue to protect teachers and boost the state’s struggling test scores. 
State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt supported the bill, saying, “I think we have something in place that’s really going to support our teachers and make a difference. I’m thrilled that the governor has decided to sign this.”
‘Streamlined process’ for removing disruptive students 
The bill outlines how and why teachers in kindergarten through sixth grade classrooms can immediately remove students who are violent, threatening or intimidating toward staff or peers, or students’ whose behavior is impeding on other students’ ability to learn. The House of Delegates amended the bill to include pre-K classrooms that are on public school grounds. 
Morrisey called it a “streamlined process” for dealing with these students. 
School counselors and social workers will now be required to determine any underlying cause of the child’s behavior. 
The measure gives the student a two- to four-week probationary period on a behavioral plan for improvement. If improvement isn’t made, the student can be placed in an alternative school or behavioral intervention program. 
Fewer than half of the state’s 55 counties have alternate learning centers.
“If there’s no county program, the student may be removed from school and find alternative learning environments. Maybe it’s a virtual school or other learning environments,” Morrisey said.
The Senate unanimously signed off the bill, and the House passed the measure with a 94-3 vote.
Three Democrats in the House opposed the measure, citing concerns about potentially unqualified counselors or social workers conducting an assessment to determine the underlying cause of a child’s behavior.
The bill doesn’t come with funding for schools to add behavioral support staff; some teachers told lawmakers that money and additional staff were key parts of addressing the problem. 
Lawmakers also passed a bill permitting counties to ban cell phones in classrooms, which was a request from Morrisey. The session ended without any movement on teacher pay raises; West Virginia teachers are the lowest paid in the nation.
“We know a lot more needs to be done,” Morrisey said. “Reversing courses is a major priority for my administration… I’m going to do whatever it takes to make sure West Virginia kids excel.”

Bryan Avila said Tuesday. 
The Senate’s tax proposal, SPB 7034, would ask state economists to study the implications of permanently reducing property taxes, which Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, former Senate president and chair of the Rules Committee, called  the most important part of the proposal.
“The study is going to be more and more critical as time goes on,” Passidomo said.
Senate President Albritton releases $2.1B tax relief bill

The committee reported the bill favorably on Tuesday.
Gov. Ron DeSantis in December proposed $1,000 rebates to each homesteaded property in Florida, totaling $5 billion, and to eliminate property taxes entirely in the future.
Alongside the Senate-proposed study is $2.1 billion in tax relief, including eliminating sales taxes on clothing items valued at less than $75, plus tax holidays, including nearly four months of tax-free purchases of guns, ammunition, and firearm accessories.
“I think it’s exactly the right thing to do, the right approach to tax policy at this point in history,” Sen. Don Gaetz said, adding that he is “disappointed” the tax on business rent is not proposed for elimination.
“I’m old enough to remember actually having been one of the original supporters of reducing the tax on leases. And it’s a tax on tax. It’s an unfair tax. It doesn’t help us. It’s anticompetitive,” Gaetz said. 
Avila said the business rent tax would be a topic of conversation as the session moves on. 
“President Albritton has certainly said, you know, that he wants and he’s committed to lessening the financial burden, not just on the residents of our state, not just on our farmers, but also on our businesses. And so, I think that that’s obviously going to be a topic of conversation,” Avila said. 
A 0.1% reduction in the business rent tax would equal about $50 million in lost revenue, Avila said.
Lawmakers last year approved reducing the state business rent tax from 4.5% to 2% effective July 1, 2024.
DeSantis called for eliminating that levy and the House is proposing reducing it by 0.75%.

Tariffs and related initiatives from the White House convulsed the stock and bond markets last week.
“Without question, there’s certainly a lot of concern, particularly in the market,” Avila said. “We need to correct those things in order to move forward, certainly as it relates to trade and the tariff discussion.”
Avila promised that state policy and budget decisions will have “more clarity as it relates to the federal picture” by the time the budget is voted on, including consideration of consumer sentiment and earnings reports for private companies. 
The end date for the regular session is May 2.
Tax holidays
Other tax holidays in the Senate bill include a weeklong back-to-school holiday, two-week disaster preparedness holiday, week-long tool and safety equipment holiday, and month-long outdoor supplies holiday. 
The House proposed a $5 billion cut by permanently reducing the sales tax and business rent tax by 0.75%. Speaker Daniel Perez has criticized sales tax holidays, although they remain a focal point of the Senate proposal. 
The House and Senate may be further apart than typical, and Avila acknowledged conversations will need to be had.
“The expectation shouldn’t be that we’re going to agree 100% on everything, because quite frankly we don’t even agree 100% with our spouses on what we’re going to have for dinner or a plan for Friday night,” Avila told reporters Tuesday. 
Several students and Sen. Mack Bernard, a Democrat from West Palm Beach, spoke in opposition to the gun and ammunition holiday, saying it would encourage people to buy guns.

Ben Hansen of Blair, left, and Merv Riepe of Ralston. April 14, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers took a step Tuesday toward requiring Nebraska health care facilities that perform procedural abortions to dispose of the remains by cremation or burial.
Legislative Bill 632, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, advanced 34-11, with one senator who voted “yes” saying after that he had done so inadvertently. However, whether the bill will have the 33 votes needed to keep moving forward depends on negotiations between Hansen and State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston for a possible amendment. 
  State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. July 26, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hansen has described the intent of LB 632 as uplifting the “dignity” of an aborted fetus, similar to a 2003 Nebraska law requiring hospitals to have a written policy for the proper disposition of the remains of any child born dead at a Nebraska hospital. 
Hansen said other health care facilities, such as Planned Parenthood, are an “exception” to the 2003 law. He has said LB 632 is mirrored after a similar Minnesota law adopted in 1987.
“Nothing differs in the body of a baby between elective or spontaneous abortion,” Hansen said, referring to the medical term for miscarriages. “The only difference is the cause of death.”
‘Back door’ abortion ban?
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, whose nonprofit I Be Black Girl is focused on reproductive justice, led opposition to the bill. She was a key part of an unsuccessful ballot measure in 2024 to expand abortion rights in the state to the point of fetal viability.
Spivey blasted the bill as a “back door attempt to ban abortions” in the state, which Hansen repeatedly denied. Spivey said the bill also ignores existing laws for how facilities handle human tissue, including fetal or pregnancy tissue.
“The reality is LB 632 disrespects patients by essentially imposing a funeral requirement for abortion,” Spivey said, stating the “human dignity” goal “cannot be further from the truth.”
She continued: “Imposing this type of requirement without the patient having any say in the matter is wrong and, furthermore, insulting.”

Under Hansen’s bill, a facility would not need to notify the woman upon whom an abortion is induced of the method of disposition of the fetal remains. Abortion is legal up to 12 weeks gestational age in Nebraska after 2023 legislation, and the Nebraska Constitution now explicitly prohibits most abortions in the second or third trimester after a 2024 vote of the people.
Broader impacts 
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings, who selected Hansen’s proposal as his 2025 priority bill, said “fetal dignity laws” are needed when the abortion “industry” shows a “high disregard” for aborted remains.
“It is crucial to start affirming the humanity of the unborn in the law,” Lonowski said. “Fetal dignity laws help shape a culture that honors and respects the unborn by acknowledging their humanity and affirming the dignity of each life lost through abortion.”
Spivey and others said the Hansen-Lonowski partnership could open the door to future “personhood” legislation, extending civil rights to fetuses often by legally stating life begins at conception. Other religions, such as Judaism, consider life beginning with the first breath.
Spivey cautioned that such laws might open the door to banning in-vitro fertilization, care for miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies.

State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln described LB 632 as “big government overreach” and read a letter from a military veteran who said she was raped while serving and got an abortion. Dungan and Spivey said the bill could revictimize survivors and limit accessibility to women seeking abortions in cases of rape or incest, which are legal exceptions to the current 12-week law.
“We can find ways to support people that don’t create these problems and that don’t have these hoops to jump through,” Dungan said. “If your true goal is to try to create a healthier, safer Nebraska, invest in health care, invest in housing, and make the right decision.”
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha also questioned whether the bill would require the burial or cremation of fetal tissue or blood, asking “how much blood has to be on the pad” or what “evidence” would be needed. She questioned whether the bill could create an abortion “bounty” and encourage civil penalties against abortion providers.
Spivey and Hunt said the end result would be increasing costs to patients, pushing care further or fully out of reach.
‘Human dignity’
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil referred to the Health and Human Services Committee hearing for LB 632, when a representative from Planned Parenthood who was asked about the organization’s current protocol for disposing of aborted remains did not specifically say what happens.
“What we do currently is completely in line with what most other health care providers who manage fetal tissue do,” she responded at the hearing.

Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska estimated that about 18% of abortions in the state are procedural, not medication abortions.
Hansen said that if burial or cremation was not being done, providers might be disposing of remains by “throwing them in a dumpster.” Hunt and Spivey said the lack of a policy didn’t mean the allegations that Lonowski, Murman and Hansen stated were accurate.
Murman argued that if the remains were treated with dignity, then Planned Parenthood should have been able to detail the process.
“I believe every human, no matter how small, deserves some measure to ensure human dignity,” Murman said.
Getting to 33 votes
Riepe spoke little during the four-hour debate but echoed a comment from Dungan that the bill is a serious topic. He continued to work with Hansen off the legislative floor and said little during debate, other than arguing that women having an “option” for the disposition of fetal remains might be better.
His possible amendment has not been filed, but in details shared with the Nebraska Examiner, Riepe is looking to give mothers the choice of mass cremation, individual burial or cremation or the disposition of remains in a manner determined by the health care facility. 
If the woman doesn’t choose, it would be up to the facility.

Riepe’s in-progress amendment also is looking to explicitly protect in-vitro fertilization and medication abortions, the latter of which Hansen sought to fix by having his language cover abortions performed and “completed” at the same facility.
Riepe told the Examiner that he and Hansen are at a “very friendly point” and that he feels good about the negotiations. 
Second-round debate would be limited to up to two hours on Hansen’s bill, pursuant to scheduling from Speaker John Arch of La Vista on “controversial and emotionally charged” bills. That could narrow the time needed to amend Hansen’s bill to secure Riepe’s support, putting him in a similar position as he was two years ago when he defeated a near-total abortion ban.
Also similar to 2023: Hansen and Riepe working behind the scenes for a path forward. The two worked together to craft the current 12-week law, rising from the ashes of the near-total ban.
“If we don’t get what I feel is needed on this thing, to try to make it a less controversial issue, then at that point in time I would not vote for cloture,” Riepe said, referring to the procedural motion to cease debate, which requires at least 33 votes. Riepe is likely to be the 33rd vote.
Freshman State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue spoke against the bill during the debate and voted against cloture, but he later voted to advance Hansen’s bill. He said that was a “mispunch” and remains opposed to the bill.
State Sens. Dan Quick of Grand Island and Jason Prokop of Lincoln were “present, not voting” on the advancement of Hansen’s LB 632. Prokop opposed cloture, while Quick did not take a position, the same stance he took when the bill advanced 5-1 from the committee.

Quick said he has some concerns about whether the new requirements would apply uniformly and that he understands, for instance, the disposition policy of CHI Health St. Francis in Grand Island but not the policies of non-faith-based facilities.
Quick said it’s possible that an amendment could address his concerns. Prokop said he would continue listening to ongoing negotiations.
‘How to grieve my losses’
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a progressive who is friends with Riepe, said an unintended consequence of Nebraska’s 2003 law required providers to ask parents what they wanted to be done with fetal remains after a miscarriage or abortion in a hospital setting. She said dictating medical practice in law means “we muck things up that we don’t even know we’re mucking up.”
Cavanaugh detailed that she had been pregnant with twins but had a nonviable pregnancy that was so early in her pregnancy she had no remains. Eight months later, as she was preparing to give a live birth to one of her children, she was still asked to fill out paperwork to cover the hospital’s liability. 
While Hansen’s bill wouldn’t require providers to talk to the parents, Cavanaugh said they would still take a family’s baby.
“I’m not going to let you take my baby and bury it without my permission, without my say-so. No. Absolutely not, 100% not going to happen,” Cavanaugh said. “If I want to bury a baby, I will grieve how it’s best for me and my partner and my family. I don’t need the state telling me how to grieve my losses.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 20:58:18+00:00,CT Mirror,Stephanie Thomas apologizes for invoking ‘SS’ when criticizing exec order,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/stephanie-thomas-ss-remark-ballot-access-criticism/,Stephanie Thomas was discussing her objections to President Trump’s executive order on elections when she referred to Nazi Germany's SS.,"Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas has apologized for making a reference to Nazi Germany’s SS in denouncing President Donald J. Trump’s executive order on ballot access to a bipartisan audience of registrars of voters.
“Let me be very, very clear here. I was NOT likening any person to members of the SS and agree that I should have not said that. It was hyperbolic,” Thomas wrote in an email Monday to ROVAC, the Registrars of Voters Association of Connecticut.
She made the SS reference while addressing ROVAC’s annual spring conference last week while discussing her objections to Trump’s executive order on elections that, among other things, would require proof of citizenship to vote. 
“I understand if my comments made you feel something that was not my intent.  Because it wasn’t my intent, you have my apologies if you felt personally attacked,” Thomas wrote. “That could not be further from my goal.”
The inspiration for the SS reference, she said in an interview Tuesday, was a section of Trump’s executive order that seemed to her to be encouraging citizens to inform on election officials who wrongly register someone.
“A private citizen can turn you in for making a mistake,” Thomas told ROVAC, according to an audio recording posted Tuesday afternoon on YouTube by House Republicans. “I’m probably going too far, but it sounds little bit like the SS to me.”
Thomas said in her written apology that a trip to Germany left an impression of how a regime turned citizens against each other.
“I was always struck by something I read there — about the large percentage of the population that were informal informants who passed along tips to the Gestapo with no evidence. The language in the EO which requires the passing along of ‘suspects’ to the DOJ sounded similar to me,” she wrote.
In the interview, Thomas said she referring to Section 5a of the executive order. 
It says, in part: “The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to enter into information-sharing agreements, to the maximum extent possible, with the chief State election official or multi-member agency of each State. These agreements shall aim to provide the Department of Justice with detailed information on all suspected violations of State and Federal election laws discovered by State officials.”
Thomas said Tuesday she apologized for the language she employed but not her opposition to the executive order she calls an unnecessary barrier to ballot access, given the extreme rarity of voting by noncitizens.
The rhetoric was a departure for Thomas, a Democrat who generally has charted an independent path on advocating for election laws and resources, breaking with her own party at times.
“When I heard about this from registrars, I was really taken aback,” said Ben Proto, the Republican state chairman and a former deputy registrar and member of ROVAC. 
Proto noted that Thomas had refrained from the rhetorical “bombs” tossed by other Democrats at Trump, notably Sen. Chris Murphy and Attorney General William Tong. Previous comments by her and a Democratic predecessor, Denise Merrill, to ROVAC tended to be “practical and non-partisan,” he said.
Neither the president or president-elect of ROVAC, Democratic Registrar Chris Prue of Vernon and Republican Registrar Barbara Richardson Crouch of Sprague, said they heard the SS reference. 
But some Republican registrars took them as an insult, and at least one, Lisa Amatruda of Woodbury, walked out.
“The venomous language and partisan rhetoric made it impossible to continue listening,” Amatruda wrote in an opinion piece posted on The Connecticut Mirror’s Viewpoints page.
Crouch and Prue both were inclined to focus on the nonpartisan task ahead: Ensuring a fair and secure election as they seek guidance on how to implement the executive order, if it survives a legal challenge.
“We are non partisan when conducting elections. We try to maintain a good working relationship, and we always do,” Crouch said. “And I know the people that are involved, whether registrars or staff or Secretary Thomas, regardless of what happens, we will focus on having a great municipal election this fall.”
The executive order applies only to federal elections, Thomas said.
Both Prue and Crouch said the SS reference was inappropriate. Crouch, who grew up in Mississipppi, added, “There are enough references of voting rights we can make about this country.”
“All of this is going to be put aside,” she said. “At the end of the day, that is the core story: Regardless of what happens, that will be put aside to make safe and secure elections.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230104_Inauguration_Hartford_YK_167-1.jpg,,,2025-04-15 17:05:55.124520

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The fate of Rhode Island’s first-in-the-nation lawsuit against fossil fuel companies rests in one state judge’s hands, following a two-hour hearing in Providence County Superior Court Tuesday morning.
Associate Justice William E. Carnes opted not to make an immediate ruling on Chevron Corporation’s push to have the case tossed on alleged procedural violations, noting the “sheer volume of materials” in the seven-year long case. While Carnes postponed a ruling, he noted several shortcomings in the arguments Chevron’s lawyers presented, including the lack of local precedent for what the oil and gas company argues was a “shotgun pleading” that relies on the same phrasing for each of the 21 companies named in the lawsuit.
Former Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Kilmartin in the 2018 complaint sought damages from a host of multinational oil and gas companies, including Chevron, based on the grounds that for each, “a substantial portion of fossil fuel products are or have been extracted, refined, transported, traded, distributed, marketed, promoted, manufactured, sold, and/or consumed in Rhode Island.” 
A series of appeals challenging a state court’s authority regarding climate change impacts from national fossil fuel companies ended in April 2023 when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case and sent it back to Rhode Island.
On trial in landmark R.I. climate change lawsuit: the meaning of ‘and/or’

Chevron’s attorneys are now seeking to have the entire case tossed on the grounds that the state failed to investigate or prove that any fossil fuel extraction, refinement or production occurred in Rhode Island, violating a clause of state court civil procedure known as Rule 11.
“It’s a ludicrous allegation that we were extracting fossil fuels in a state where fossil fuels were never extracted,” Gerald Petros, a Providence  attorney representing Chevron, said during Tuesday’s hearing.
But the state, which has brought in San Francisco law firm Sher Edling LLP to help its case, contended that the “and/or” in the complaint covered its bases. Even if Chevron never produced or refined oil in Rhode Island, 18 years of business filings with the Rhode Island Department of State and records of local TV and print advertisements   prove its local activity, according to exhibits included in court documents.
While the state’s investigation has yielded some proof of Chevron’s local activity, the company has refused to hand over private information relating to its business activity, sales and advertising in Rhode Island, making it impossible for the state to fully substantiate its claim, Matt Edling, partner at Sher Edling, said during the hearing.
“We know this evidence exists but we don’t know the depth of it,” Edling said.
While Carnes delayed a ruling on Chevron’s motion to toss the complaint under alleged procedural violations, he granted in part a request by the state to compel the oil and gas company to hand over documentation of its business activity. Carnes limited the scope of discovery to the time period named in the complaint — 1965 — rather than the earlier 1950 start date the state requested. Carnes also ruled that subsidiaries and affiliates of Chevron Corp. were not subject to the court-ordered document sharing based on a 2022 Rhode Island Supreme Court decision. And, as it relates to evidence of natural gas activities, Chevron only has to share records of business that affected consumers, according to Carnes’ order.
Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office, issued a statement Tuesday in response to requests for comment.
“We appreciate the Court’s thoughtful review in granting this order, and we look forward to securing relief on behalf of Rhode Islanders and the environment,” Rondeau said in an email.
Theodore Boutrous, a partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in California which is also representing Chevron, shared the exact same statement provided a day earlier when asked for comment on Carnes’ order.
Chevron has 90 days to hand over the required evidence to the state. Another hearing on the case is scheduled for May 8, by which time Carnes said he expects to have issued an order on Chevron’s Rule 11 motion.
In closing remarks, Carnes pledged to be fair to both sides and move as quickly as he could.
“I am going to try to keep a cool, clear head and try to keep as much acrimony out of this as possible,” he said. “I know there’s a lot of water to come over the dam.”

Members of the Office of the Auditor General, or OAG, testified before the Michigan state House’s Child Welfare System Committee Tuesday to outline some of the findings from the 2018 report and a subsequent updated report from July 2024 that the office says the health department has still not addressed.
Those findings include the OAG’s assertion that CPS is still failing to initiate investigations in a timely 24-hour manner, potentially leaving children in dangerous conditions for prolonged periods of time.
But the bulk of the remaining issues the updated audit found place more focus on documentation and less focus on what actually protects children from cycles of violence, Senior Deputy Director of Michigan’s Children’s Services Administration, or CSA, Demetrius Starling told lawmakers on the committee. CSA is housed in the state health department. Since the 2018 report, as confirmed by the updated audit, Michigan has made movement to improve Child Protective Services, with Starling crediting the department’s Keep Kids Safe agenda, unveiled in 2023, for improvements.
“The [Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’] investigates approximately 70,000 referrals of potential abuse and neglect on an annual basis and uses comprehensive approaches to provide the necessary responses based on the risk of each child,” Starling said. “Michigan kids are counting on us.”

Since 2018, the state health department has complied with several recommendations from the OAG, Yvonne Benn, an audit agency administrator with the OAG said. The updated audit found such improvements like improved timeliness for completing CPS investigations and referring cases to applicable prosecuting attorneys when appropriate.
Benn said after Tuesday, members from the OAG will return to the committee next week to continue presenting recommendations they say the health department has not addressed.
In regards to the specific issue of investigation initiation, Starling said the updated audit acknowledges that CPS since 2018 has firmed up its definition of what constitutes the commencement of an investigation as once an investigator gets face to face with a reported victim for a safety assessment. 
But that face-to-face interaction is taking on-average 72 hours to occur, Keith Edwards, who oversaw the OAG’s follow up told committee members Tuesday. Michigan law doesn’t prescribe what defines the commencement of an investigation, but Edwards said auditors found that CPS’s adopted policies fall short of other states’ child safety standards.
CPS’ current policy to start the clock at face-to-face intervention gives investigators and violence prevention stakeholders time to gain a solid understanding of a child’s situation, Starling said.
“At the end of the day, all of these cases are important, so our staff are very diligent about the fact of trying to or at least attempting to make contact within 24 hours… we do a lot of background work with a lot of folks,” Starling said. “So we’re gathering evidence by looking at our own case history. We’re doing case planning with our supervisors. We’re making other successful investigative contexts before, in some instances, face-to-face is even attempted. So there’s a lot of work that goes into preparing for an investigation and committing an investigation.”
As the state health department continues to disagree with several of the findings in the OAG’s audit, Starling said the audits have not been without merit as auditors acknowledged several actions taken by the department to improve child welfare.
“We all have a common goal, which is to ensure that kids are safe. I think we can find some common ground,” Starling said. “We want to make changes, whether it be policy or statutory changes to make sure that families and children are safe in our community, so there’s no acrimony. There’s no hard feelings, but however, I do stand by the fact that there are some things within this report that are inaccurate.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 20:50:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Some CT legislators call for more taxes on rich. Will Lamont agree?,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/some-ct-legislators-call-for-more-taxes-on-rich-will-lamont-agree/,Gov. Ned Lamont has refused to increase taxes on CT's wealthiest. But many fear that his resolve could soon be tested as never before.,"Gov. Ned Lamont has steadfastly refused to increase taxes on Connecticut’s wealthiest residents throughout his six-plus years in office.
During that time, legislators have proposed income tax surcharges, mansion taxes and other changes aimed solely at high earners, but they abandoned every measure before final budget negotiations with Lamont.
But many fear that pattern could be tested in the coming months as never before. 
State officials face un unprecedented fiscal double-whammy: federal budget cuts that could easily take hundreds of millions of dollars from Connecticut and its municipalities, and a looming recession could drain billions more.
President Donald J. Trump and the Republican-led Congress want to extend expiring 2017 federal tax cuts, a move that would chiefly benefit households making more than $320,000 per year. And they are seeking more than $880 billion in federal budget cuts to help pay for it, moves state leaders fear will slash resources for Medicaid, special education, food stamps and other programs.
Progressive Democrats in the General Assembly say Connecticut will need to capture a portion of the tax relief that is granted to affluent households to help stop programs from being gutted.
Senate leader: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this’
“I think, in the near term, we’re going to have to have a serious conversation in this state” about boosting Connecticut taxes on the wealthy, said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee and a member of the House Tax Equity Caucus. “If those who are making the most money in this state — more than most people can imagine — are going to be getting a tax break from the federal government, at the expense of our families … then I don’t think it’s asking much.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who has sponsored many of the progressive tax hikes measures since 2019, said the increases state legislators envision would still leave the wealthy richer than ever. In other words, the extra ask from Connecticut would be smaller than the relief coming from Washington.
Looney noted that federal aid to states traditionally grows during a severe economic downturn. But even with consumer confidence and the stock market shaken by Trump’s recent tariffs — some of which he has since delayed — Congress continues to move forward with plans to slash aid to states.
“We’ve never faced anything like this,” Looney added. “We’ve never seen a [recession] situation where federal aid was not at least a relative constant.”
During both the economic downturn that followed COVID’s first appearance in 2020 and what economists called the Great Recession from December 2007 through mid-2009, Connecticut saw its resources from Washington grow considerably.
Congress followed the pandemic with several aid bills, the chief of which, the American Rescue Plan Act, sent about $3 billion to state government in Connecticut alone and billions more to local school districts, regional councils of government and other entities.
And in 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act sent nearly $5 billion to Connecticut, which used the funds to bolster education, housing, human services, economic development and transportation.
But what happens if the nation slides into an economic recession while Washington is cutting, not expanding, aid to states?
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the nonprofit research organization generally recognized for declaring the start and end of recessions in the U.S., has made no pronouncement to date.
But the stock markets largely have slumped since Trump’s Feb. 1 executive order announcing his first import tariffs. And the Consumer Confidence Index hit a 12-year low in late March.
If a new recession were to hit Connecticut as hard as did the 2007-09 downturn, which reduced General Fund tax receipts by 10% within two years, the state’s coffers could lose more than $2 billion per year in revenue.
Earlier this spring, Lamont outlined scenarios in which Connecticut could lose anywhere from $186 million per year to $880 million — in Medicaid funds alone — based on the reduction scenarios circulating on Capitol Hill.
None of that includes potential cutbacks in federal aid currently provided to municipalities and public colleges and universities, losses that state officials fear could stretch into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Is CT’s rainy day fund enough? Questions grow.
Both Looney and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, have questioned whether the state’s record-setting $4.1 billion budget reserve, though impressive, could stem those negative fiscal tides for long.
Democratic leaders have suggested, in that event, that Connecticut suspend one of its chief budget caps, a controversial provision that forces legislators to save a portion of income and business tax receipts. This cap has captured an average of $1.4 billion each year since 2017 — about 6% of the General Fund — and used it to build reserves and reduce the state’s considerable pension debt.
Critics say the program has been too aggressive, leeching far too many dollars away from education, health care and other core services.
Lamont, who initially rebuffed efforts to reform this cap, conceded in February that changes were necessary and agreed to return a modest $300 million, or about one-fifth of the average annual savings, to the General Fund to support services.
But the governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, says it’s premature to weaken the budget cap any further to offset what many say is an impending fiscal crisis. Lamont also has repeatedly said boosting taxes on the rich would cause them to flee the state, an argument many of his fellow Democrats don’t accept.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Monday the governor still isn’t ready to commit more resources now to offset the financial pain that may come.
“The administration is having ongoing discussions with legislative leadership about a path forward after we see a final federal budget and know its impact on Connecticut,” Collibee said. “Especially in light of recent economic concerns, his preference is increasing the number of taxpayers in our state, rather than increasing taxes.”
Lamont is not alone.
The Yankee Institute, a conservative fiscal policy group based in Hartford, recently launched an online petition urging the governor to leave the budget controls alone.
“This isn’t a fiscal emergency — it’s a spending trap,” the institute wrote in a statement.
“Legislative leaders are pressuring Gov. Lamont to declare a ‘fiscal emergency,’” it continued. “Not because there’s a real crisis, but so they can pause Connecticut’s fiscal guardrails and ramp up spending.”
State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, also called for Lamont to preserve the controls.
“The focus is on you now,” Harding said. “Stand strong against your fellow Democrats who want to break the guardrails. Stand strong against the job-crushing tax hikes that this will cause.”
But many Connecticut Democrats say the states’ wealthiest residents, who were supposed to start paying more federal taxes with their spring 2026 income tax returns, will continue to enjoy tax cuts — not “job-crushing tax hikes” — under the agenda Trump and the GOP-led Congress are following.
Since Trump signed the 2017 federal income tax cuts, the collective fortune of Connecticut’s 14 billionaires has grown by $33 billion or 61%, according to a new analysis released this week by the CT Citizens Action Group and Americans for Tax Fairness.
And according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget Policies and Priorities, a Washington-based fiscal think-tank, households in the top 5% of earnings — those making more than $320,000 per year — could receive roughly half of the proposed windfall from extending those cuts through 2034.
To pay for that relief, programs that fund health care, special education, food and heating assistance likely will be diminished.
Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, founder of the tax equity caucus, says drawing down on the state’s rainy day fund and scaling back budget caps won’t provide enough long-term funding to even adequately mitigate the losses Connecticut is facing.
“I think it’s going to take everything,” Elliott said, adding that includes some of the federal tax relief that Connecticut’s highest earners will receive.
“Progressive taxation is the only path to a stable, long-term revenue stream capable of meeting the growing needs of our communities,” added Norma Martinez HoSang, director of Connecticut For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations.
CT child tax credit remains on the table
Progressive Democrats also aren’t looking just to raise more dollars for core services like health care and education.
They also want to cut state taxes on low- and middle-income families hurt by inflation in recent years and potentially facing a big cost-of-living jump related to tariffs.
A report last week from Yale University’s Budget Lab estimated that tariffs imposed this year to date could cost the average household an extra $4,700 on a wide array of goods and services. [Trump announced a three-month pause on certain tariffs last week but left in place new duties on Chinese goods.]
The most popular proposal involves creating a new $600-per-child credit within the state income tax, up to a maximum benefit of $1,800 per household. Given the strains facing state finances soon, though, some legislators have said this tax cut might need to be phased in over several years.
The state’s own fairness studies show that Connecticut’s combined state and municipal tax system disproportionately burdens the poor and middle class, largely due to its reliance on property taxes to fund city and town government services, including K-12 education.
Last year’s study found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and two-and-a-half times the statewide average.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, the other co-chair of the Human Services Committee and a supporter of a state child tax credit, said he remains hopeful Lamont will modify his opposition to taxing the wealthy as the full extent of cuts to state programs becomes clearer.
“I think when the numbers come out,” Lesser added, “you may see a change of heart. … Any way you shake it, that will have a humungous human toll in Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay_0942-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 17:05:55.124520

(Photo courtesy of Sarah Boses)The New Mexico Department of Health is warning people against giving baby poultry as gifts on Easter Sunday this weekend because of chicks and ducklings’ links to salmonella risk.
Children who handle, snuggle or keep poultry inside homes face increased exposure to salmonella bacteria, which causes salmonellosis disease, DOH said in a news release on Tuesday morning.
“Even healthy-looking birds can shed salmonella, which can cause serious infection,” Sarah Shrum Davis, an epidemiologist with the bureau, said in a statement. “To prevent infection, children under 5 should not handle poultry. Make sure older children wash their hands after handling birds or their eggs. And do not kiss or snuggle live poultry.” 
Davis told Source NM in an interview on Tuesday that salmonella normally resides in poultry’s gastrointestinal tract without making the birds sick, and when the birds poop, it is present in their feces.
Keeping poultry inside the home “highly increases” the risk of exposure to salmonella, she said.
“People can be concerned — baby chicks and ducklings are small — so maybe they keep them in the kitchen or somewhere warm where they’re safe from predators,” Davis said. “We advise against that.”
The same applies if someone spends time in a bird enclosure, even if they don’t touch the birds themselves, she said. Salmonella can live on surfaces for some period of time so if someone touches a surface where a bird has been, like their bedding, it is possible to be exposed.
“That’s why we recommend that people always wash their hands after they clean the coop, handle anything or touch anywhere the birds might have been,” Davis said.

Symptoms of salmonellosis typically include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, according to DOH, but more serious infections can spread from people’s intestines to the blood stream and throughout the body, which can be fatal if left untreated.
A higher risk of developing a serious infection and complications exists among infants, young children, older adults, transplant recipients, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
When Source NM asked the New Mexico Department of Agriculture about whether chicks and ducklings also carry any risk of spreading a strain of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) called H5N1, spokesperson Jenny Green told Source NM in an email that “the risk of salmonella is far greater than that of HPAI at this time.”
H5N1 was detected in a commercial chicken flock in Roosevelt County last April, and in a private backyard flock of chickens, ducks and geese in Bernalillo County in February.
Green wrote that as young people in 4-H and FFA programs participate this spring in “Chick Days” at farm supply retailers, NMDA and the New Mexico Livestock Board urge people to prevent the spread of both pathogens.
Green shared preventive measures including properly handling and cooking eggs, buying chicks from hatcheries approved by the National Poultry Improvement Plan, isolating new chicks for a month, wearing dedicated clothing and shoes when handling poultry, and reporting sick birds to the Livestock Board by calling 505-841-6161. 
NMDA is also pointing people to best practices it published in March and from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in April.
For salmonella, DOH recommends preventive measures such as: thoroughly washing hands with soap and water after touching live baby poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam; not allowing live baby poultry inside homes or in kitchens and pantries or other areas where food or drink is prepared, served or stored; and consulting with a doctor if anyone experiences abdominal pain, fever or diarrhea.



As many as 130 cases of salmonellosis are reported in children each year in New Mexico, according to data compiled by the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Bureau at DOH.
In 2022, New Mexico had 465 total cases of salmonellosis among adults and children, according to the latest available DOH data.
DOH cited a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that salmonella causes about 1.35 million infections in the U.S. each year.

(Amalie Hindash for New Jersey Monitor)News that the CEO of the state’s grid operator is resigning provides an opportunity for the company to “reform its practices,” a New Jersey Senate Democrat said Tuesday.
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said PJM Interconnection President and CEO Manu Asthana’s impending departure should signal a change in priorities for the company, which Democrats have blamed for skyrocketing electric rate hikes.
“The departure of PJM’s President is an opportunity for the organization that determines our utility rates to reform its practices to prevent the spikes in electric bills that have been imposed on New Jersey ratepayers,” Burzichelli said in a statement. “As the disastrous results of the latest energy auction show, the current system is broken.”
Burzichelli sits on a legislative committee that has been tasked with examining rate hikes.
Asthana announced Monday that he’s stepping down at the end of 2025 after five years at the helm of the Pennsylvania-based PJM, which operates the electric grid for 13 states, including New Jersey.
The change comes as Democrats in the Legislature fret over rising electricity rates that are scheduled to increase in June.
PJM critics have griped that renewable energy projects that could lower consumer costs are languishing in the company’s interconnection queue, the waiting list for generation projects looking for permission to connect to the grid.
The company has said spikes in demand and lower supply drove up the price of electricity. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, say Gov. Phil Murphy’s focus on renewable energy sources has caused the spike in rate hikes by decreasing the state’s energy supply.
Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex), when asked about Asthana’s retirement during an energy-focused press conference Tuesday, quipped that he thought “PJM couldn’t retire outdated and expensive things.”
“It doesn’t really matter who is at the head,” Zwicker said. “We should make sure that whoever that person is understands the importance of queue reform happening quickly.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DSCF6204_1-1024x649.jpg,,,2025-04-15 17:05:55.124520

(Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana state lawmaker who’s also a veterinarian wants protections for his profession after protestors demonstrated outside his clinic last year against Gov. Jeff Landry’s plan to bring a live tiger to an LSU football game. 
Senate Bill 21 by Sen. Bill Wheat, R-Ponchatoula, would add veterinarians, veterinary staff and veterinary practices to an existing state law that prohibits the battery of certain health care workers and criminalizes unlawful disruptions at certain medical facilities. The bill was unanimously advanced by the Senate Judiciary C committee and will next be discussed on the Senate floor. 
Wheat told committee members a fellow veterinarian brought the idea for the bill to him after a workplace violence incident at their practice. The lawmaker said he believes veterinary practices were inadvertently left out of the original legislation.
“I don’t think there’s any surprise that animals are very important to people’s lives,” Wheat said. “We certainly would like to be respected in that same manner as the protections in that definition.” 
Wheat said members of his veterinary clinic staff were threatened and intimidated by protesters over a “misunderstanding of how we were going to deal with the LSU tiger situation.” 
Wheat was among the Republican officials, who are also veterinarians, who met with Gov. Jeff Landry and the dean of LSU’s Veterinary School about the governor’s request to bring Mike VII to a game at Tiger Stadium. The university had done so for many years before officially ending the practice in 2017. 
Wheat said he was always opposed to bringing the tiger in a trailer cage to the sidelines. 
“For many reasons, I felt strongly this was not a good idea and expressed my opinion at the time,” Wheat said in a social media statement in November. 
Landry later opted to bring in a rented tiger from Florida to briefly participate in the pregame festivities at the LSU-Alabama game in November 2024. 
Wheat confirmed to the Illuminator before the game that the tiger would be present but later clarified in a social media statement that he was “never consulted with or involved in any subsequent decisions concerning the use of another tiger for such purposes.”

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)This is an interview with Louisiana Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, that took place earlier this month about his priorities for the state legislative session that started Monday. It has been edited for length and clarity. 

You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch. 

O’DONOGHUE: I want to talk about what you think are the big issues during the session. 
HENRY: One of the big topics, I think, is going to be the transformation of the [Department of Transportation and Development]. 

I think there’s some great people that work over there. I think the system that is set up and has been in place for so long really doesn’t afford them the opportunity to be as successful as they want. The governor has looked at different states, specifically Tennessee, as a model to kind of begin that transition. 

I think we’re going to make some good progress on it this year. It’s just a multi-year process, but it’s something that has to get done, because there’s nothing more frustrating for citizens. 
O’DONOGHUE: When you talk about restructuring DOTD, are you talking about fewer state workers working there? Are we outsourcing more things?

HENRY: They want to make sure that the folks that are working over there now have a purpose, have responsibilities, and are doing a good job. 
The number of employees is really going to be based on the amount of actual work being done. … I believe we have something around maybe 5,000 employees and 500 engineers. If, after we put all this together, if that’s how many employees we need, then that’s how many employees we will have. If we can trim that down and put more money into actual concrete, I think that’s a better purpose for it. 

O’DONOGHUE: ​​On March 29, there were constitutional amendments on the ballot that didn’t pass. Amendment 2 probably has an impact on budget and tax issues. Can you talk about what you think might come back that was Amendment 2? That you all might relook again at again during the session? 

HENRY: Well I mean, obviously, Amendment 2 would have been pretty significant for our budget, specifically on the recurring dollars part. It didn’t pass. We have to move on.

I’m sure members are going to look at possibly dissecting that larger amendment into smaller amendments. But you know, you really have to step back and make sure that the next time that’s on the ballot, even in a scaled down version, we have the ability to really sell it better, with greater explanation, and not have as many things on the ballot.

We are going to come back in the future with a similar amendment, but maybe breaking that down into different sections, maybe picking one or two really hot topics within that. It’s something that we have to do in the long run. 

We have too much recurring dollars going into these funds that we can never get into. … You’re putting money into your savings account at a low interest rate, and you’re borrowing money at a higher interest rate. It just doesn’t make sense.

O’DONOGHUE: Do you think you all are going to look at trying to find a way to get some of that money back into the budget for teachers [pay stipends]? 

HENRY: It’s whether or not we want to kind of piecemeal it, or do we want to step back and say there’s got to be a better way in the future to give teachers a pay raise instead of a stipend? So maybe we don’t give that this year, or that [total stipend] amount this year, and we look forward to further clarifying what we wanted to do in the amendment and bringing that back in the future. 

O’DONOGHUE: Do you expect there will be a big conversation around civil service? Obviously we’re seeing a big conversation at the federal level around public sector workers.

HENRY: I want flexibility to give certain people raises who are excelling but also allow them, some of them, to work from home, remote work, more flexibility, and the system in place now with civil service does not give, I guess, supervisors or the governor the flexibility to put people where they need to be. 
Some of them have a skill set that they work better in the office. Some of them have a skill set to work better from home. Their jobs allow them to do that. So I would like to let every employee excel at their own rate and not be tied to one system that really doesn’t afford for that. 
O’DONOGHUE: What do you expect to see on insurance?

HENRY: [E]veryone wants to lower homeowners insurance and car insurance, and we’ve passed a significant amount of bills dealing with homeowners insurance … and we’re still waiting for our homeowners insurance to go down.

We’re going to continue to work on trying to lower auto insurance. It’s a very sensitive subject to a lot of people. … When we’re passing a law, it’s not only affecting the bad actors. It affects everyone. 
[W]e’re trying to balance that while making sure we make the state friendly to get insurance companies here because, obviously, more insurance companies will ideally lower rates. We don’t know when, but you can’t cede all of your authority and all of your rights to the insurance company on the off chance that they lower your rates.
O’DONOGHUE: [T]here’s a lot going on in D.C. right now, sort of a lot of uncertainty about what’s being cut and what’s not and some of that will affect Louisiana. How are you all trying to prepare for that? 
HENRY: At the end of the day, the greatest impact is on the [Louisiana Department of Health], which is about 50% of our budget. … 
I’m having conversations with Congressman Scalise and Senator Cassidy to work through these issues of what adjustments you are going to make and can we see them? Can we have a discussion before you implement them? And can you give us maybe five years to implement them? 

Because when you make a change that reduces a program, the problem still exists. … If the program was a fraud and a fake, of course, you get rid of it. …  But again, not all of them are like that. 
The legislature and the government have to find a way to fund whatever is cut to make sure we’re taking care of the services for the people of Louisiana. So it’s going to be difficult, but I mean, it’s part of the job. It’s why we ran for office. So I’m confident that our delegation, and we have a great delegation across party lines up there, we’ll make sure that Louisiana doesn’t come up short.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Legislature-open-1772-1024x954.jpg,,,2025-04-15 17:05:55.124520

During a previous meeting of the committee in March, House Election Integrity Committee Chair Rachelle Smit (R-Martin) detailed her frustrations regarding a request she made with the Michigan Department of State in November while serving as the minority vice chair of the House Elections Committee where she requested information used to train election workers. 
Smit told the committee her office made its first request on Nov. 7, two days after the 2024 election, seeking access to the Bureau of Elections e-learning portal, which provides education and training materials for the state’s election clerks. 
“In response to my request, we were initially told that we could not access the information, but maybe some exceptions might be made,” Smit said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Smit said she was asked to submit a Freedom of Information Act — or FOIA — request for the information, with the Department of State confirming on Nov. 20 that Smit’s office submitted a FOIA asking for “electronic copies of all training materials offered or otherwise provided to elections clerks.” The department denied the request on Nov. 21 due to a lack of specificity and offered the opportunity to resubmit the request. 
According to the department, Smit submitted a refined FOIA request on Dec. 10, 2024, with the Bureau of Elections sending a letter on Dec. 18 requesting an extension in fulfilling the request. 
On Jan 7, 2025 the department sent Smit an estimate of the cost for fulfilling the FOIA request, saying the request would take 140 work hours to fulfill, with an estimate cost of  $8,781.75, which Smit called “ridiculous” saying it was “obviously designed to deter our office from scrutinizing its elections management.”
Nearly a month later, Smit sent a direct request in her capacity as the chair of the Elections Integrity committee, which she said received no response initially. 

“Our staff followed up on the request repeatedly, only to be met with obvious sandbagging and delayed efforts. We even have met with representatives from the department and discussed the request. Ultimately, the department promised they would produce some of the request materials, but not all,” Smit told committee members in March.
According to the Department of State’s timeline, their staff discussed the request with Smit’s staff on Feb. 19, seeking clarity on what documents would be most helpful. Smit reiterated her request for all information so as to inform the committee’s work 
On March 4, the department said it verbally informed Smit that its staff was working to compile a response, which they expected to deliver by the end of the week, by Friday, March 7. 
However, Smit said she’d exhausted all options, and sent a formal request to the Oversight Committee to issue a subpoena to the department to produce the records they had requested. 
The Oversight Committee posted the notice of its March 11 meeting four days earlier, with the Department of State sending its response to Smit later that afternoon. 
During the March 11 committee meeting, Smit said the Department “deliberately and openly withheld documents on the pretense that the clerk’s educational materials were too sensitive to disclose to myself,” Smit said, emphasizing her background as a former township clerk and her role as the chair of a legislative committee. 
Following the meeting, the House Oversight Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Twp.) sent a letter to the Department of State, giving them 10 business days to provide the remaining documents. 
The department responded to DeBoyer’s letter on March 19, noting that its response to Smit had come about through a combined 42 hours of tax-funded time, costing $3,820.52, producing more than 1,200 pages of documents with more than 300 links to election law references in response to Smit’s “wide-ranging and inexact request for records.”
“Despite this, the Oversight Committee scheduled a hearing and took testimony on the false premise that the department had not adequately responded to Rep. Smit’s request,” Michael Brady, the department’s chief legal director wrote in the response.
“After MDOS expended a considerable amount of taxpayer funded staff time to provide these records, it was disappointing to see that the chair of the Election Integrity Committee had apparently not thoroughly read our response. In addition to the resources we provided, we indicated that much of the information she sought is publicly available on our website,” Brady continued.
While DeBoyer’s letter requested login credentials for the e-learning portal, noting that links to several of the pieces of information requested by Smit directed the user to a password-protected website, Brady responded noting that the portal “contains sensitive training materials regarding the cyber security and physical security of election systems and election machines.”
“This limited access is critical to ensure the ongoing integrity of our election systems and thereby the integrity of our elections. Lest there be any question as to the necessity or wisdom of complying with industry ‘need to know’ standards in the protection of critical infrastructure and sensitive information, unfortunately, we need look no further than the ongoing criminal prosecution of individuals (including a former state representative from during her time in office) who are alleged to have attempted to gain unauthorized and illegal access to voting machines for their own personal and political purposes,” Brady wrote, referencing former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) who is facing criminal charges for allegedly attempting to access and tamper with voting tabulators following the 2020 election.
While the department acknowledged it had withheld some items as they were  sensitive or unduly burdensome to produce, Brady explained Smit’s request for items from 2016 to 2018 predate the administration of current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, making it significantly more difficult to locate potentially responsive documents and ensure a complete response. 
Additionally, the e-learning portal contains more than 500 items in various formats including materials on cyber security and physical security of election machines, Brady said. If these materials were to be released, each item would need to be individually reviewed and redacted, he said.
DeBoyer sent another letter on April 4, giving the department until April 14 to provide the documents it had not provided. In its response, the department reiterated the security concerns in providing login credentials to access the training materials, but said it would be happy to provide the materials on a rolling basis following a security review, and planned to produce initial materials on April 30. 
During the meeting, all nine Republican members in attendance voted to authorize the issuance of the subpoena while six Democratic members voted in opposition. Rep. Reggie Miller (D-Van Buren Twp.), the committee’s minority vice chair, passed on her vote. 
When issued, the subpoenaed parties would include the Michigan Department of State, and/or its relevant officers, employees or agents, including Benson and any records custodian of the Department of State.
The subpoena, when issued, requests any documents and information outlined in DeBoyer’s letter that have not yet been provided. At this time the authorization is only for a subpoena to seek the production of records. 
In a statement posted after the vote, Smit said the training materials she requested weren’t state secrets, but basic materials regularly provided to election clerks. 
“Secretary Benson had five months and ample opportunities to be transparent and work with us to strengthen our election systems. She refused, leaving us with no choice but to issue a subpoena,” Smit said. 
Angela Benander, Benson’s chief communications officer, further emphasized the security concerns that could come with forcing state employees to disclose sensitive information, noting that the department will take all necessary steps to protect the security and integrity of Michigan’s elections and is more than willing to make those arguments in court.
“The House Oversight Committee, after rejecting the department’s multiple attempts to provide the requested materials in a way that protects the security of our election system, instead voted to issue an unnecessary subpoena for this sensitive information,” Benander said. “This includes materials that show active screens of the Qualified Voter File; specific information that could be used to compromise the technology used by local election officials; specific procedures for securing voting equipment, ballots, and other election-related materials; information that could be used to gain improper access to secure communication channels used to report security risks; specific locations of election administrator training and templates for official election notices.” 
“Unfortunately, the committee has hijacked what was supposed to be a legitimate oversight process. They have made the committee chair — a single individual with no legal background — judge and jury with the power to force state employees to disclose sensitive election security information or face discipline. It’s now clear that the plan all along was to weaponize this process and continue to undermine the public’s faith in the security and legitimacy of our elections,” Benander said. 
The Michigan Democratic Party similarly condemned the vote, with party Chair Curtis Hertel slamming House Republicans for granting the oversight committee subpoena power, saying they’d given themself the power to investigate their political opponents. 
“This is a gross overstep by the House Oversight Committee, plain and simple. If  [Michigan House Speaker Matt] Hall (R-Richland Twp.) really cared about transparency, he would’ve sent FOIA reform to Governor Whitmer for signature, but we all know that this is really about political persecution, not good government,” Hertel said, in reference to Hall’s refusal to move forward with a package of bills passed by the Senate that would subject the Legislature and the Governor’s office to the state’s Freedom of Information Act. 
Hall stood by DeBoyer’s decision during a press conference on Tuesday, telling reporters he’d told DeBoyer and the committee to issue subpoenas if departments or administrations are not responding.
“I’m not holding them back, right? We’re asking them to go out and do a job, and if that’s what they need to do, then I support them 100%,” Hall said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0546-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 17:05:55.124520

(Stock photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)Legislation directing the University of Iowa to form a new center focused on American history, civil government and intellectual diversity is headed to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk after Senate passage.
House File 437 would require the UI to establish a “center for intellectual freedom,” which would open with one offered course on American history and civil government and develop campus programming about free speech and civil discourse.
The center would work with similar civics initiatives at Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa to create academic programs, including undergraduate and graduate degrees, that would be accessible online or in person by students at all of the universities.
A nine-person advisory council created by the Iowa Board of Regents, of which no more than one member can be employed by the UI, would oversee the center. The council would conduct the search for a center director for approval by the board of regents. Whoever is appointed director would have “sole and exclusive authority” over hiring and firing practices for the center.
“This bill, as amended, comes as a result of a compromise with the board of regents,” floor manager Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen said. “This bill creates a huge step forward in strengthening civic education at Iowa’s three regent universities and in promoting greater intellectual diversity at the University of Iowa.”

Senate Democrats who spoke against the bill said it was duplicative of both Iowa code and what the UI already offers to students. Sen. Herman Quirmbach of Ames said the state already houses 18 centers of intellectual freedom — the community colleges and universities that make up the Iowa public higher education system.
Quirmbach gave examples in Iowa law of academic freedom and free speech protections for students and universities. Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, also argued the proposal was redundant, listing current UI classes covering American history and politics.
Quirmbach also pointed out that giving exclusive hiring and firing power to the director could lead to certain viewpoints being outweighed by others that the director may have a preference for.
Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, questioned the legality of naming the University of Iowa in the bill when references to certain cities and counties in other legislation have been restricted. She also brought up costs, referencing a fiscal note putting the cost of establishing a school of intellectual freedom at $1.5 million, and said there is no guarantee that the center will garner interest from students.
“The majority party is legislating less bang for the public buck,” Weiner said.
The bill passed with a 32-15 vote.

This year, marijuana advocates are playing defense in multiple state legislatures. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
North Dakota holds steady on marijuana penalties

Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
A debate headed for the ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting marijuana potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
Recreational marijuana measure defeated in North Dakota

With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

(Photo courtesy of John Walker)Four of the 10 newly confirmed members to a state fishing advisory panel already want out, two days before their first meeting with offshore wind developers, Rhode Island Current has confirmed.
Three people appointed to the Fishermen’s Advisory Board have decided to resign after the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council’s April 8 confirmation vote. A fourth candidate said he was no longer interested before the vote, but his name was inadvertently included on the list anyway, Laura Dwyer, a CRMC spokesperson, said in an email Tuesday.
Hardly an auspicious start for the revived fishing advisory panel, which has been defunct since all of its former members quit in protest in August 2023. The group is meant to advise the CRMC in its review of offshore wind projects, but former members alleged the reviews were mere “political theater” that ignored their input.
Can a local fishing panel make a difference in offshore wind projects? We’re about to find out.

Past members’ misgivings soured at least two of the new members on participation, one of whom hopes his resignation will stall upcoming reviews of the SouthCoast Wind cable burial plan. The new fishing panel is scheduled to meet with project developers for the first time Thursday.
John Walker, a Newport resident and commercial fisherman, will not be attending. He said in an interview Tuesday that he planned to submit his resignation notice to state regulators shortly.
“From what I understand, we don’t really have a say in any of this,” said Walker, who also ran for Newport City Council in 2024. “At this point, the best thing we as a state can do to advocate for our industry is try and stall these projects.”
Walker first connected by email with Jeffrey Willis, CRMC executive director, in late February, after being recommended by his friend for the volunteer advisory panel. 
Walker said his calls to Willis seeking more information went unreturned and that he never had a direct conversation with anyone at the CRMC. Willis sent two emails to interested board candidates, including Walker, on March 6 and March 21, regarding their participation and the council’s upcoming vote, according to public documents. Walker said he never saw them.
In the meantime, Walker said former advisory panel members he talked to persuaded him against joining. He had no idea he was confirmed to the board until he read a news article days after the vote took place.
‘Are you kidding me?’
Adam Silkes was similarly caught off-guard that his name was on the public list of candidates confirmed to the panel. Silkes, a North Kingstown resident who works for his family-owned shellfishing company, American Mussel Harvesters, was still in disbelief when contacted by phone Tuesday morning,
“Is it confirmed? Am I on this?” Silkes asked. “You’re kidding me. Really?”
Silkes received emails from Willis in March notifying him about an initial Zoom training call and the subsequent confirmation vote. But two days before the CRMC was set to vote, Silkes emailed Justin Skenyon, a member of the agency’s permitting staff, to withdraw.
“I won’t be able to commit to FAB,” Silkes wrote in the email, obtained by Rhode Island Current. “I’ve got too much on my plate already.”
Skenyon replied the next morning, thanking Silkes.
Yet on the evening of April 8, Silkes’ name was on the list of 10 people, plus an alternate, that the council appointed to the advisory board. 
Dwyer was aware that Silkes had withdrawn but said the agency could not amend its publicly posted agenda prior to the vote.
“CRMC spoke with everyone who was on the FAB list — either via a virtual onboarding meeting back in March, or via phone if they missed the meeting,” Dwyer said.
She did not respond to requests for comment on Walker’s version of events , and had not received his resignation notice. Willis deferred requests for comment to Dwyer.
The CRMC has also not heard from another dropout: Isaiah Alavarez. Alvarez was confirmed to the board on April 8, but told Rhode Island Current via text two days later that he did not plan to continue. Alavarez did not return multiple inquiries for comment.
A fourth member, Jennifer Scappatura-Harrington, emailed the CRMC Tuesday that she no longer wanted to be a part of the group, Dwyer said. Scappatura-Harrington, who owns Quonnie Siren Oyster Co. in Charlestown, did not immediately return inquiries for comment.
Silkes cited his busy schedule as the initial reason why he decided he couldn’t commit to joining the board. But when pressed, he acknowledged that he was also hesitant because of what former board members told him.
“It’s 100% both,” said Silkes. “A very close friend of mine was on the previous board. When I talked to him, he said he spent like thousands of hours in meetings. I have so much going on personally and professionally.”

Starting anew
Time spent on negotiations over offshore wind projects in 2023 brought the former advisory panel members to their breaking point. With the new group of volunteers, Willis hopes to minimize frustration by reducing the number of meetings they attend, he said in a prior interview. 
Federal regulations dictate where and how projects get built — state oversight is limited to affirming whether or not the proposals meet Rhode Island coastal regulations. There’s also no federal requirement that offshore wind project developers pay fishermen to offset industry losses. The CRMC has tried to help negotiate for compensation in past project reviews, but fishermen were largely dissatisfied with the amounts that developers agreed to pay. 










Is it confirmed? Am I on this? You’re kidding me. Really?


– Adam Silkes of North Kingstown when told he had been appointed to the Fishermen’s Advisory Board 


“If we show up to a meeting with a developer, that’s it, they can check that box,” Walker said. 
He hoped that by resigning and “exposing” the miscommunication with state coastal regulators regarding its attempts to repopulate the fishing panel, he could stall upcoming progress on SouthCoast Wind’s permit application.
Not likely, said Jim Boyd, former CRMC deputy director who retired in 2022. As Boyd noted, the 2011 state regulations that created the Fishermen’s Advisory Board set a 20-person maximum, but no minimum. As long as at least one person remains on the board, the state requirement to have the panel meet with offshore wind developers is satisfied.
Another new member of the panel, Jeff Grant, confirmed he plans to serve, despite the board’s history of limited input on offshore wind.
“If something good can come out of it, I am open to it,” said Grant, a  Warwick resident and member of the Rhode Island Shellfisherman’s Association. “I’d like fishermen to have more of a voice in what happens.”
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an April 10 report evaluating the Rhode Island coastal management program wrote that it “meaningfully engages with the commercial and recreational fishing sectors on the offshore wind energy development review process.” However, the 147-page report also noted the “dissatisfaction of the Fishermen’s Advisory Board” in that review process.  
Silkes said his personal interactions with the CRMC related to changes to his company’s leases for local aquaculture farms have been positive”
He did not feel so complimentary when it came to the agency’s failure to remove his name from the list of advisory panel candidates before the confirmation vote, or to include his email notifying them he did not want to join in its public records.
“That’s messed up,” he said.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Democratic Party on Tuesday condemned Senate Republicans’ passage of a bill ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the state, saying the way they did so violated the Legislature’s rules.
“What happened on the Senate floor was nothing short of disgraceful,” Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, said in a release Tuesday. “They did not allow any debate. They didn’t even allow us to take up the amendments we had filed in the system and have a hearing on each of them — which I believe, under the rules, is something that had to happen. The rules were simply not followed.”
The Senate passed Senate Bill 474 March 26. The House of Delegates passed it at 10:41 p.m. Saturday, a little over an hour before the legislative session ended. 
When the bill got back to the Senate to concur with House changes to the legislation, Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, made a motion to suspend Joint Legislative Rule 3, which governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers. The motion was adopted and the Senate concurred without considering any of the 13 amendments to the bill that Garcia filed.
Minutes later, Tarr withdrew the motion to suspend Joint Rule 3 due to a technical error. Another member then moved the previous question to consider the Joint Rule 3 motion again and concur with and pass the House’s version of Senate Bill 474. Again, the Senate voted 31-2 approving the bill.
As motions were considered, microphones for Garcia and Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell — the lone no votes on the bill — were muted while they attempted to call points of order on Tarr’s motions as well as Smith’s rulings.
According to the Democrats, Tarr’s motion to suspend Joint Rule 3 required a two-thirds vote by the Senate and concurrence by the House of Delegates, neither of which happened.
The Democrats also criticized comments from Senate President Randy Smith, who said after the chaos that he didn’t understand the legislative procedures that led to the passage of the bill. His job, he told West Virginia Watch, is to preside over the body and the process, but other people tell him what is within the rules and not. 
“The Senate President is the presiding officer of the Senate. It’s literally his job to make sure rules and procedures are properly followed,” West Virginia Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said in the news release. “In this instance, President Smith didn’t just neglect his duties; he actively abdicated his responsibility.”
Smith, through a spokeswoman for the Senate, did not comment further on Tuesday. 
Senate Bill 474 is the legislative side of an executive order posed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey that bans offering specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex. It’s reflective of a trend spearheaded by Republicans nationwide meant to undermine and end DEI in all its forms.

Senate Joint Resolution 11 would require a two-thirds majority vote from the Iowa Legislature to increase individual or corporate income tax rates, or to establish any new income taxes.
The resolution, passed 32-15, brings the measure closer to appearing before Iowa voters on the 2026 general election ballot and potentially added to the state constitution. In Iowa, constitutional amendments must be passed by the state Legislature in two consecutive general assemblies and then approved by a simple majority as a ballot measure in a general election.

As both chambers approved the proposed amendment in the 2024 legislative session, all that is left is for the Iowa House to take up the measure and pass it before the language would go to voters for final approval.
During floor debate Tuesday, Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, said Iowans have “entrusted” protection of the Iowa State Constitution with lawmakers — and that the proposed amendment will improve protections for Iowans. De Witt said the state constitution is “a barrier that guarantees those folks that voted us in their freedom — and freedom from excessive taxation is real.”
“This constitutional amendment will actually strengthen that constitution,” he said. “That is our job.”
Democrats argued the measure would limit the abilities of lawmakers Iowans elected to make decisions on issues like taxes. Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, said the measure is “tying any future legislature’s hands (more) than anything I have ever seen,” keeping lawmakers from accessing tools — particularly, the ability to raise income taxes — that may be crucial for managing budget crises in the future.
The Des Moines senator said limiting income tax increases is especially devastating as the state is facing decreasing revenues while federal financial prospects remain uncertain. The governor’s budget proposal for the upcoming year fills the gap from a projected revenue shortfall, in part caused by recent cuts to state income tax rates, using money from the Taxpayer Relief Fund and other reserve funds.
“We have different philosophies in taxation, and that’s not a bad thing,” Bisignano said. “But this particular proposal is nuclear. It’s nuclear to this state into the future. And what you’ve done through your architecture is set this state up for probably one of the largest sales tax increases we will ever see.”
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said the measure, by not limiting other types of government fees and fines, or taxes like property and sales taxes, will mean the state will turn to tax increases that “will all fall on the backs of working Iowans.” Democrats and advocates with groups like Common Good Iowa have argued that income taxes are more equitable than other forms of taxation, as wealthier taxpayers typically pay a higher proportion of taxes than low-income people.
“I do not like higher taxes. I also don’t happen to like unlimited budget items like vouchers,” Weiner said. “… This constitutional amendment, joint resolution, does nothing to limit property taxes, sales taxes, or other government fees and fines, and that’s where politicians will have to go in the future if they fall short to balance their budgets.”
Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, criticized Democrats for not considering spending cuts as an alternative to any kind of tax increases.
“Basically, what you’re saying, is if we get tight on the budget, you’re just going to right away raise taxes,” Kraayenbrink said. “You’re not going to look at what you’re spending. You’re just going to raise taxes.”
De Witt stressed that the constitutional amendment would not entirely block future lawmakers from raising income taxes, but would just require a two-thirds majority to approve an increase, a higher standard than simple majority approval currently required.
“Raising taxes on anything, I don’t care what, should be hard,” De Witt said. “… The comment came up earlier, ‘What if we have a state emergency?’ What if we do? The worst thing it’s going to do is force us to work together.”
The measure moves to the House for further consideration.

In 1989, Ronald Johnson did not think he would live to see old age. Johnson, a Black gay man, was diagnosed with HIV that year, during the height of the U.S. AIDS epidemic, when the life expectancy was 1 to 2 years after diagnosis.
“I just assumed that I would die,” Johnson told The 19th. “I’m from New York City, and particularly before treatments, I was seeing friends and people I know dying. Then going into the ’90s when treatments became available, and there was the struggle to get access to the treatment, dealing with managing the regimen of treatment: the number of pills that you had to take, some had to be refrigerated, some had to be taken before meals, some taken with meals. It was a challenge.”
Over the course of his career as a respected advocate and policy expert, Johnson watched activists and researchers fight for treatments and prevention efforts so that he and others could live long, happy lives. With modern treatments, a person living with HIV now has a similar life expectancy as someone who does not have HIV.

This article was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Thirty-six years after Johnson’s HIV diagnosis, on the afternoon of his 77th birthday, he spoke with The 19th about a new threat that he fears will disrupt those decades of progress — and could hit older LGBTQ+ people the hardest: federal cuts across a range of health equity and social safety net programs, particularly in HIV services under the Department of Health and Human Services.
The National Institutes of Health has reportedly canceled hundreds of active grants funding research on HIV and AIDS, according to the science journal Nature. Last week, thousands of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were fired or put on administrative leave. This includes those working in HIV prevention and treatment like Dr. Jonathan Mermin, the director of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.
Among its responsibilities, the center monitors HIV transmission trends, conducts research on prevention strategies, publishes guidance on medications for pre- and post- exposure to HIV and funds community-based prevention and treatment organizations. The CDC cuts are part of a broader push by President Donald Trump’s administration that also includes possible cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of the Administration for Community Living, which funds services to help aging people and those with disabilities live independently in their communities versus being housed in institutions.
Advocates say that the cumulative loss of services will be devastating for older people living with HIV, a disproportionate number of whom are LGBTQ+. About 54 percent of people living with HIV in the United States are ages 50 and older. By 2030, researchers estimate that this proportion will increase to 70 percent of those living with HIV. In 2021, this age group represented 16 percent of new HIV diagnoses in the country.
“In general, most people don’t think about older people and sexuality or sexual health,” said Terri Wilder, the HIV/aging policy advocate at Sage, a national organization focused on older LGBTQ+ people. “We’re very concerned that people are going to acquire HIV. Some people are not going to be connected to care. They may not have access to a test to find out if they have HIV, and by the time they find out, they might be so sick and ill that they may be very vulnerable to death.”

Older LGBTQ+ people with HIV sit at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities. Older people and queer people generally are both at higher risk of receiving improper or discriminatory medical care. They also face challenges with housing insecurity and financial instability that can worsen with the costs of medical treatments.
These factors can converge with remaining HIV stigma and inconsistent access to education, prevention and treatment efforts, which create barriers to identifying HIV and receiving care soon after exposure to the virus. In 2021, an estimated 34 percent of people aged 55 and older diagnosed with HIV in the United States were also diagnosed with AIDS, according to CDC data.
“I think with increasing age, we also tend to see a decline in the immune systems associated with aging. And so when you’re combining age-associated decline with HIV, then we see a more rapid declining immune system function, like with an earlier progression to AIDS,” said Kristine Erlandson, a professor with the University of Colorado School of Medicine’s division of infectious diseases.
Jeff Landry picks formerly indicted Jindal official to run Louisiana health department again

Beyond the education and prevention work, older people with HIV have other considerations. As people age with HIV, many experience conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, bone frailty or heart disease at younger ages than expected, Erlandson said. This has raised questions about whether providers need to be testing for and treating these other conditions more aggressively at an earlier age for people with HIV.
Federal agencies like the CDC play a key role in HIV prevention and treatment. The National Institutes of Health runs clinical trials used for vaccine development, the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Ryan White Program provides funding for HIV clinics, especially for uninsured or low-income people. The CDC was the first federal agency to monitor the HIV epidemic in the 1980s, and it continues to fund community work and maintain important geographic data that can show if a particular state or region of the country is experiencing an outbreak.
Though people over the age of 50 have been overlooked in HIV prevention and treatment work broadly, advocates made strides in recent years to bring more attention to their needs. In 2024, a new rule designated people living with HIV and LGBTQ+ people as populations of “greatest social need” under the Older Americans Act. The law was initially passed in 1965 to fund a network of programs and services aimed at addressing a range of needs, including caregiving, transportation and nutrition.
As a result of the updated rule, states “need to specifically account for the ways in which they are addressing the needs of these populations. So it’s a way for the feds to essentially make sure that these populations are given the care and attention that they need, regardless of whether you live in Oklahoma or Massachusetts,” said Kae Greenberg, a staff attorney at the Center for HIV Law and Policy.
Authorization for the Older Americans Act expired in September. In December, the Senate passed a measure for reauthorization, but the House did not vote on the bill before the end of the congressional session. Last year, Wilder from Sage and other advocates were also close to changing the CDC’s HIV screening guidelines, which currently recommends providers offer tests to people between the ages of 13 and 64. Wilder said removing the upper age limit would support testing for older people.
The current political climate has created stress and anxiety for older people living with HIV who are left with the uncertainty of what services and medical coverage they have access to, Johnson said.
During Trump’s first term he praised scientific breakthroughs in prevention work and promised to end the HIV epidemic by 2030. Johnson — who spent years working on AIDS policy locally in New York City and at national organizations — said it’s unclear what kind of progress, if any, will continue to address these concerns during the new administration.
“I am very, very upset over what has been taking place in the past few weeks and what is taking place every day,” Johnson said. “The infrastructure of care, prevention and research that has developed over the 40-plus years of this epidemic is virtually being eliminated or drastically reduced to the point that the progress that we have made, and the impact of that progress on people’s lives — the saving of lives — is being threatened.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — During her investiture as Kentucky’s first female chief justice, Debra Lambert said her experience growing up in Eastern Kentucky shaped the path she’s taken in life. 
Lambert, a native of Bell County, said her parents, James and Kathleen Hembree, “weren’t given much in the way of educational opportunities.” Her father worked as a coal miner at the same mine his father worked at before him, and her mother’s father “was a Baptist preacher who thought high school was only appropriate for his sons but not his daughters.”

With a piece of mining scrip tucked in her shoe for good luck, Lambert was publicly sworn into her office on the high court Tuesday, surrounded by her family, fellow justices, and members of Kentucky’s other government branches, including Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne. 
“So, for my brief experience and tenure as chief justice of the commonwealth, I think my parents’ philosophy will guide me well — work hard, be joyful and be fearless,” Lambert said. 
Lambert’s four-year term as chief justice began in January.  She represents the 3rd Supreme Court District, which includes southern parts of Central and Eastern Kentucky; voters  elected her to the court in 2018.
Several speakers noted that the current Kentucky Supreme Court is historic for women, not only under Lambert’s leadership, but also because the majority of the justices on the court are women and recently elected Justice Pamela Goodwine is the first Black woman to sit on the court. 
“When we do the work of this court, which is interpreting our Constitution, our statutes, looking at cases that were heard throughout the commonwealth for error, we are neither man nor woman … ,” said ​​Justice Angela McCormick Bisig. “We are all legal scholars working together side by side, regardless of those issues. So quite frankly, we don’t discuss it a lot among ourselves, but today I really just want to sing it from the rooftops, because it is a historic day in our state that we have this situation with this Kentucky Supreme Court.” 
Lambert and Goodwine were set to have their investitures in January shortly after assuming their offices, but the events were postponed amid severe winter storms. Goodwine’s investiture will be held Friday at 1:30 p.m. at the Capitol.

Justices on the court selected Lambert to serve as chief justice in September. She succeeds retired Chief Justice Laurance VanMeter in the role. He administered the oath of office to Lambert and Deputy Chief Justice Robert Conley Tuesday.
Lambert now lives in Pulaski County with her husband, Joseph Sharpe. Lambert earned her degrees from Eastern Kentucky University and the University of Kentucky College of Law. She previously was married to former Chief Justice Joseph Lambert, who left the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2008.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Lambert was on the Kentucky Court of Appeals and was appointed as a family court circuit judge in the 28th Judicial Circuit by former Democratic Gov. Paul Patton in 1999. She practiced law in Mount Vernon as an assistant commonwealth’s attorney and city attorney.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders as she announces Arkansas' request to exclude soda and candy from SNAP benefits on April 15, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The state of Arkansas submitted a waiver Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Agriculture seeking to ban food stamp recipients from using the benefit to purchase soda and candy.
Arkansas is among the first states to request these restrictions for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries, with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders citing President Donald Trump’s “laser focus” on solving America’s “chronic disease epidemic” as a motivating force.
Sanders announced the waiver submission alongside U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Arkansas Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam at the Governor’s Mansion Tuesday, with a stated goal of having the waiver approved and the proposed restrictions in place by July 1, 2026.
The second Trump administration has been pushing to “Make America Healthy Again” since Trump retook office in January, with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. frequently railing on ultra-processed foods and other foods he said are contributing to poor health in Americans.
Sanders echoed those sentiments during her remarks Tuesday.
“Our country spends $119 billion dollars each year on food stamps. Twenty-three percent of that spending, which is $27 billion annually, goes toward things like soft drinks, unhealthy snacks, candy and dessert,” she said. “At the same time, our state Medicaid program spends at least $300 million each year treating chronic illness. Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health — we’re paying for it on the front end and the back end.”
“That’s not a nutrition program,” Sanders continued, “it’s actively harming Arkansas’ health and contributing to our nation’s mountain of debt.”
Proposed SNAP asset limit increase heads to Arkansas House after committee approval

Adding rotisserie chicken
The exclusion of soda and candy would not decrease overall SNAP benefits received by beneficiaries, she said, but would rather free up more of their benefits for healthier foods.
In addition to banning the purchase of soda and candy, including zero-calorie soda, the state also requested that “low and no-calorie soda, fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice” and “unhealthy drinks” also be excluded from the list of foods eligible to be purchased with SNAP money.
Foods considered candy in Arkansas’ waiver request are “confectionary products with flour and artificially sweetened candy.”
“At the end of the day, we will never restrict choices of you, of myself, of others,” Rollins said. “What we’re working to do is make sure that taxpayer dollars — that when government is involved, and when they’re spending the money of our people — that that money is being spent wisely and in the best way we know how.”
Arkansas is also asking the federal government to allow SNAP recipients in the state to use their money to purchase rotisserie chicken.
“The State also proposes to distribute SNAP Education nutrition program funding directly to schools, food banks, and other community agencies so they can distribute healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables to families and provide education and outreach about healthy food choices,” the waiver request reads.
Rollins said that as she and Sanders were addressing the small crowd at the Governor’s Mansion, Kennedy was in Indiana for “a similar event” with Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun.
Putnam, whose department oversees SNAP and federal health insurance programs for Arkansas, said allowing the purchase of soda and candy with SNAP benefits subsidized unhealthy nutritional choices.
“We’re devoting … significant resources to treating the same health conditions brought on by consuming unhealthy food,” Putnam said. “This makes no sense. … Why do we contribute to poor health in one program and then try to fix it in another program?”
Industry objections
Food industry groups immediately decried the state’s request. The American Beverage Association, an industry group for non-alcoholic beverage companies, criticized Sanders and Rollins for “choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.”

“Make no mistake, this waiver won’t make an ounce of difference on health,” the ABA wrote in an emailed statement. “If Governor Sanders is serious about making Arkansas healthy again, this would be a comprehensive effort — not one narrowly focused on excluding one population from buying just two sets of products in the grocery store.”
Meanwhile, the National Confectioners Association called the move “misguided and not needed,” citing data released by the USDA in 2016.
“SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats — not meal replacements,” said Chris Gindlesperger, NCA’s senior vice president of public affairs and communications, in an emailed statement. “In fact, candy purchasing patterns are basically equivalent between SNAP and non-SNAP families — with only 2% of SNAP purchases being candy. Consumers have a unique mindset when they enjoy chocolate and candy that is not present when interacting with other foods — whether or not they are using SNAP benefits for food purchases.”
According to that same study, 20 cents of every dollar spent by both SNAP and non-SNAP recipients went towards “sweetened drinks, desserts, salty snacks, candy, and sugar.” Soft drinks specifically made up 5.44% of a SNAP household’s expenditures, according to the study, which relied on purchasing data from 2011. 
“The SNAP program is designed to help those in need of assistance, not to hurt them,” Rollins said. “It’s also funded by the American taxpayer, who deserves a say in how the program is administered and what the program funds. President Trump has given his administration, our administration, the mandate to make America healthy again.”
The state is implementing what Sanders described as a voluntary 30-day public comment period on the waiver.
As Sanders and Rollins were speaking at the mansion, state lawmakers at the Capitol about two miles away debated a bill Tuesday morning that would require the Arkansas Department of Human Services to submit a waiver to exclude candy and soda from being eligible for SNAP money. Senate Bill 217, sponsored by Sen. Clint Penzo, R-Springdale, would require DHS to continue submitting the waiver request every year if it is denied.
Dennis Farmer, president of the Arkansas Beverage Association, spoke against the bill, saying such legislation would put a “scarlet letter” on producers of the targeted products. Just because the state won’t pay for it, doesn’t necessarily mean it will change SNAP beneficiaries’ consumption behavior, he said.
Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families also spoke against the bill.
“While we appreciate the positive intent, the bill would be an example of unnecessary government intervention in people’s daily choices, and it kind of misses the mark when it comes to ensuring better health outcomes for low-income families,” said Christin Harper, AACF’s policy director.
Harper said the administrative complexity of implementing restrictions such as the ones proposed in the bill would be “costly and confusing.” 
“A lot of candy bars have chocolate and nuts but, as has been mentioned, so do a lot of granola bars,” Harper said. “So this potentially introduces a slippery slope in terms of debating what foods are healthy or not, good or bad, and puts an additional stigma on those receiving SNAP benefits.”
Incentive-based programs have been shown to produce healthier outcomes, she said, “without restricting people’s autonomy in their grocery shopping.” More focus needs to be given to the root causes of poor health outcomes, such as poverty, unstable housing and access to medical care, she added.
The committee ultimately voted along party lines, 12-5, to advance the bill to the full House.

He's afraid his friend will lose access to critical care if Medicaid is cut. Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.Patrick Chesla’s friend — a Vietnam War veteran named Ted — lives at the Martin Luther Campus, an assisted living facility in Bloomington. He’s been able to receive treatments for urinary infections and other ailments and is being cared for at the facility thanks to Medicaid. Chesla, who was in tears, said his friend would be homeless without the program for low-income and disabled Minnesotans.
“If he lost his care here, where would he go? Would he become homeless?” Chesla said of his friend Ted. “We gotta fight for this.”
Chesla was on a panel Tuesday at the assisted living facility, hosted by Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, a Democrat from the 3rd District. They gathered to discuss the impacts of Republicans’ proposed $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid.
“The Republican proposal to gut Medicaid will not only be devastating to the 1.4 million Minnesotans who get their health care coverage through Medicaid, it will be devastating to all Minnesotans,” said Morrison, a physician. “It will impact everyone, regardless of whether you get your health care through Medicaid or not. It will be devastating to our local hospitals, health care system, and our state budget.”
Republicans want to cut Medicaid and other programs to pay for more border enforcement, defense spending and tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest Americans.
One-fifth of Minnesotans are enrolled in Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program. State budget officials estimate that Minnesota will lose between $1.2 to $1.6 billion annually if the proposed cuts become law. About 650,000 Minnesota children are enrolled in Medicaid, or nearly half of the total. Another 125,000 of enrollees are people with disabilities.
Minnesota Medicaid Director John Connolly said that if the cuts are implemented, Minnesota will need to either cut the number of people eligible, cut provider payments or reduce the benefits and services that are covered in the program.
Connolly said the proposed cuts would cause state officials to make “impossible” and “unbearable” choices about what to cut.
Walz said that the federal officials proposing the Medicaid cuts are clueless.
“They have no damn idea what they’re doing. They don’t listen to people who know,” Walz said.
Republicans say Americans overtaxed and that the tax cuts would spur investment and create jobs.

(Photo by Gerald Matzka/Getty Images)The State Properties Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a seven-month lease for the use of the Cranston Street Armory for the filming of director M. Night Shyamalan’s next Hollywood movie, which will star Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor.
The agreement allows Two Beacons Productions LLC to film a “supernatural romantic thriller” at the Cranston Street Armory beginning May 1. Two Beacons, which has its principal offices in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, is managed by Blinding Edge Pictures Inc., founded in 1998 by Shyamalan, the director of  the 1999 supernatural thriller “The Sixth Sense” and the 2016 horror-thriller “Split.”
Rhode Island Film & Television Office Executive Director Steven Feinberg told the committee Blinding Edge Pictures will pay the state $10,000 a month to use the armory through the end of 2025. Shyamalan’s production company will also have to cover any utilities used in the 118-year old building in Providence’s West End.
A copy of the lease agreement was not immediately made available. Rhode Island Current submitted a public records request to the Rhode Island Film & Television Office after making an inquiry to the Department of Administration.
“We’re really excited to have the production here,” Feinberg told the committee. “We’re promoting Rhode Island to a worldwide audience.”
Filming will happen primarily in Providence beginning some time in June, Feinberg told reporters after the meeting. Other locations in the state will also likely be in the film, but he declined to say where.
Gyllenhaal is best known for his role in the 2005 romantic drama “Brokeback Mountain” and is now appearing on Broadway as Iago in the 2025 revival of William Shakespeare’s tragedy “Othello” opposite Denzel Washington.
Dynevor, who portrayed Daphne in the first two series of Netflix’s “Bridgerton,” will also appear in Shyamalan’s new film, according to IMDB.
For the project, Shyamalan is collaborating with author Nicholas Sparks, best known for the 2004 romantic drama “The Notebook.” Shyamalan will independently write the screenplay and Sparks will write the book relating the same original love story, Feinberg said.
Feinberg declined to name a title. However, a collaboration between Sparks and Shyamalan on a story titled “Remain” is in the works, according to Penguin Random House.
Sparks announced his writing partnership on the project in January.
“It’s unlike anything we’ve done before,” he wrote in a Facebook post. This collaboration is a dream come true, and I’m so grateful for the chance to work with such extraordinary artists.”

Feinberg has tried to court Shyamalan to film in the Ocean State before. He told reporters he sought to have the acclaimed filmmaker shoot his 2024 psychological thriller “Trap,” which starred Josh Hartnett, at the former Dunkin Donuts Center in downtown Providence. But they were unable to seal the deal because of ongoing work to the roof of what is now the Amica Mutual Pavilion. 
Ultimately, “Trap” was shot in Hamilton, Ontario in Canada.
Feinberg said he hopes Shyamalan’s latest production will turn him into a repeat customer for future projects and bring even more directors to Rhode Island.
“This is the best place to make a movie,” he said. “It’s the smallest state with the greatest backlot.”
But Feinberg said maintaining a film industry in Rhode Island isn’t always feasible because of the $20 million tax credit cap his office can’t exceed when reimbursing production 30% of their budgets.
“I’ve turned away Academy Award winners, I’ve turned away TV series because we don’t have enough credits,” Feinberg said. “We’d love to get that raised.”
The state has so far received two applications from film productions seeking tax credits under the state’s motion picture company tax credit law for 2025, according to the Department of Revenue’s Division of Taxation website. 
Names of each production are left off of the impact analysis posted online. One production, which filed an application on Dec. 23, is expected to spend $31 million and get $9.3 million in credits. 
Rhode Island has landed its fair share of Hollywood screentime in recent years. 
Sections of Providence, including the Rhode Island State House, recently served as a backdrop for the romantic drama “Ella McCay.” The film starring Emma Mackey, Woody Harrelson, and Jamie Lee Curtis wrapped up production last summer and is expected to be released in September, according to Variety.
The Cranston Street Armory was also used for filming of Disney’s “Hocus Pocus 2” in 2021.
“With our unique landscape and talented local artists, Rhode Island is an ideal location to film a motion picture or television series,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “Every time a production shoots here we see a positive impact on our local businesses. This is the type of energy that keeps moving our economy forward.”
Feinberg estimates that the Shyamalan’s production will create 400 full-time jobs for movie crews and roughly 2,000 positions for extras, who will likely be scouted by Boston Casting and Rhode Island Casting.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A House panel on Tuesday passed a controversial bill that would make it more difficult for residents to get issues on the ballot.
Senate Bill 1027 would limit the number of signatures that can be collected in each county to 11.5% of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election for a statutory change. For a constitutional change, the number of signatures collected could not exceed 20.8% per county.
Critics say changing the state’s initiative petition process would dilute the voting power of those in urban counties, while supporters argue that it is important to ensure election integrity and transparency.
“It pushes out the signature gathering process to make sure that it’s not all confined to the metros,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, the House author.
Currently, signature gatherers aren’t going to some rural counties, Hilbert said.
“All this does is require people to go out to multiple counties instead of just sticking to the two urban metros to get their signatures,” Hilbert said.
Currently, it takes 92,263 signatures for a statutory change and 172,993 for a constitutional amendment to get on the ballot. Signature collectors can be paid and be from out of state. No financial disclosure is required. Money from out of state can be used.
Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said in prior years, there have been other iterations of the bill trying “to hinder the public’s ability to engage in the process” after voters upheld the separation of church and state, modernized alcohol laws and legalized medical marijuana.
Bennett said the real issue is that urban voters are making decisions that rural lawmakers don’t like.
“I am sick and tired of 50% of Oklahoma being made to be less Oklahoman than rural Oklahoma, just because we live in a more dense space,” Bennett said.
The measure would also give the secretary of state, who is appointed by the governor, the power to remove the gist, the brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet. 
Currently, the attorney general reviews the ballot title, the language on the actual ballot.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has checks on both the gist and the ballot title.
Any Oklahoman can file a challenge to the gist before signature collection begins.
Under Hilbert’s bill, circulators must be registered Oklahoma voters, disclose if they are being paid and the source of the payment.
Paid circulators could not take money from an entity outside Oklahoma or be paid based on the number of signatures.
The measure passed by a vote of 14-4. Its passage was met with boos from some members of the audience. The measure moves to the House for consideration.

,California,2025-04-15 19:40:45+00:00,CalMatters,Commercial salmon season is shut down — again. Will California’s iconic fish ever recover?,Alastair Bland,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/water/2025/04/commercial-salmon-season-shut-down-again-california/,"While it’s an unprecedented third year in a row for no commercially caught salmon, brief windows will be allowed for sportsfishing in California.","In summary
While it’s an unprecedented third year in a row for no commercially caught salmon, brief windows will be allowed for sportsfishing in California.



Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials today shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row. 
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
Today’s decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs. 
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon. 
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before. 
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored. 

This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.  
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.  
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said. 
“It continues to be devastating. Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”Sarah Bates, commercial fisher based in San Francisco
Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income. 
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said. 
Fewer returning salmon
Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years. 
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance. 
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland. 
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
The future of California salmon is murky
Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River. 
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said. 
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy. 
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping (salmon) runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening.”Peter moyle, uc davis fish biologist
State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of a warming environment. 
Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items but leaves out equally critical ones, like protecting minimum required flows for fish — what Artis said are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career. 
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring. 
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period. 
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent. 
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

In all, the budget eliminates 850 vacant jobs over two years, leaving more than 14,000 open jobs.
The Senate budget committee reviewed its budget proposal Tuesday, putting the $32.6 billion plan on track for approval by the end of the week. 
The state House will draw up its own budget. The chambers then compromise on a budget that will go to Gov. Josh Stein. 
Republican senators found millions in savings by eliminating jobs. Budget writers said they looked to cut jobs that have been vacant for months or years. 
“We have this money that’s been sitting there,” said Sen. Brent Jackson (R-Sampson). So they decided to “take the money and put it to use somewhere else.”
State agency leaders for years have stressed their inability to fill jobs featuring salaries that are not competitive with the private sector.
Sen. Val Applewhite (D-Cumberland) questioned making wholesale jobs cuts without a study to determine whether agencies need the positions and just haven’t been able to fill them. 
“These numbers sound arbitrary,” she said. “How have we identified what the appropriate number is to do the work?” she said later. “How were the cuts made? Was it random, or was it a workload issue?”
It’s also difficult for job seekers to apply for state jobs.  
Staci Meyer, director of the Office of State Human Resources, told legislators this year that state hiring practices need to be modernized. 
The Senate budget proposal includes a provision allowing job applicants to upload resumes or website profiles, with the information to be imported into state job application forms. 
The provision also makes it easier for state agencies to make temporary employees permanent. 



Waiting for a new DMV commissioner and audit
The budget establishes a new nine-member Board of Motor Vehicles that would appoint the DMV commissioner. As it is now, the state Secretary of Transportation appoints the commissioner. DMV Commissioner Wayne Goodwin announced in February that he would not reapply for the job. 
The DMV has come under fire as residents wait months for appointments.
State Auditor David Boliek is auditing the agency. 
Senate Republicans overseeing the transportation budget have written about modernizing DMV services.
The state has invested in the DMV over the years but hasn’t seen improvements, said Sen. Vickie Sawyer (R-Iredell). 
Legislators hope to have the audit results in hand before the budget is finalized, she said. They’ll be more comfortable providing DMV with more money when a new commissioner is appointed and the audit is complete.
 “We have invested in the DMV over and over and over again,” she said. “They are a rudderless ship.”
Offices and filled jobs eliminated 
The budget eliminates the Office of Historically Underutilized Businesses which helps women- and minority-owned businesses compete for state contracts. 
Sen. Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford) questioned eliminating the office. “I have the data to support what they’ve done,” she said. 
The North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission would be eliminated. The commission was established in a 2006 law on the suggestion of former Republican Chief Justice I. Beverly Lake, Jr. 
The commission has received 3,826 claims of innocence from people convicted of crimes since 2007, which resulted in 15 exonerations, according to its most recent annual report. 
Sen. Danny Britt (R-Robeson) said other organizations do the same work at no cost to the state. He named the NC Center on Actual Innocence as one of them. 
The budget also eliminates the “certificate of need” requirement for health care facilities and equipment and gets rid of the state office that oversees it. 
Senate Republicans have waged a years-long campaign to eliminate certificate of need laws. The Senate has also scheduled a separate bill eliminating certificate of need up for a floor vote Tuesday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1557-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 16:09:38.921173

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Senate County and Municipal Government Committee approved a bill Tuesday that requires municipalities to disclose information about discretionary spending accounts that the jurisdiction created.
SB 306, sponsored by Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, would require municipalities with discretionary accounts to publish both the balance and spending activity each month.
“What this does, it is really to have transparency in government,” Kitchens said to the committee. “Different agencies, different elected officials who have discretionary accounts, it is to make it more accessible to people. Similar to what we go through with the campaign finance report, it would be publicized.”

The bill would require government agencies, boards, commissions and departments to make that information available online through their website; with the Association of County Commissions of Alabama or with the Alabama League of Municipalities.
Judges, district attorneys and clerks may also make that information public with the Administrative Office of the Courts.
Kaleb Beck, legislative counsel for the Alabama League of Municipalities, spoke against the legislation during a public hearing.
“The League’s first area of opposition is the resource burden this will place on our cities,” Beck said. “For example, our smaller municipalities might lack the technical expertise or staff to, every month, format and upload these types of documents.”
He said that municipal clerks that oversee less populated areas of the state already perform different functions, and the legislation will place them with another responsibility.
“If residents want this information published, this can be pushed for at the local level,” Beck said. “We can trust that our municipal officials will be receptive to their constituents’ wants and needs, and if not, they can be held accountable at the polls like every other elected official in the state.”
After the public hearing, Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, said she would propose an amendment to the legislation to make it easier for the smaller jurisdictions to comply with the provisions with the bill.
“I understand the issue with the smaller municipalities, it may be an issue for them,” she said. “If they didn’t have the abilities to publicize it, some small towns may not have a website, but that it would be posted at city hall, a county courthouse, or whatever.”
Kitchens said he is open to continue discussing the elements contained in his bill.
“This seems like an incredibly low bar for me to reach,” said Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, the chair of the committee. “I am very supportive of your legislation.”

Brian Kemp held a tax policy bill signing ceremony Tuesday in Cobb County. Kemp signed into law a one-time tax refund for 2025 and an state income tax rate cut. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
An additional state tax refund could be deposited into Georgians’ bank accounts or mailed to them within the next few weeks. 
On Tuesday, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a pair of state tax legislation that will provide a one-time rebate up to $500 to Georgia families and a reduction in the state income tax that is estimated to save Georgians about $880 million over the next year.
Kemp’s signature on House Bill 112 authorizes the extra tax refund this year designed to provide relief to taxpayers who qualify. Using a portion of the state’s reserves, the state will send $250 to individual taxpayers, $375 to single adults with dependents and $500 to married couples filing jointly. 
This makes the third consecutive year the state has sent the bonus refund to taxpayers. 
“We know that this is your money, not the government’s, and we know that you know best how to spend it,” Kemp said. “I’m proud to put this money back where it belongs and entrust hardworking Georgians with their own funds, especially as families deal with the high cost environment that we have been in over the last several years.”
The bill signing ceremony was held before a crowd of several hundred attendees at a Cobb County Chamber of Commerce event inside the Coca-Cola Roxy venue at The Battery Atlanta.
The governor said that the occasion was the result of the commitment made by state leaders over the last couple of years to save or return over $7.6 billion in income tax refunds, property tax exemptions, and state gas tax suspensions.
Kemp also on Tuesday signed House Bill 111, which accelerates an income tax rate and lowers it from 5.39% to 5.19%.
Under a previously approved plan, the rate would eventually drop to 4.99%.
This year’s income tax cut means the state will miss out on about $880 million in revenue next year. The one-time rebate is also projected to cost another $1 billion to the state’s coffers.
The soundness of the Kemp-backed tax cut has been met with diverging opinions from a pair of Georgia-based think tanks. 
Kyle Wingfield, CEO and president of the conservative-leaning Georgia Public Policy Foundation, credited state lawmakers for the progress made by lowering the flat tax rate on personal and corporate income to 5.19%.
The biggest threat to Georgia’s strong business climate are tax policies from other surrounding states that are more advantageous to economic growth, Wingfield wrote in an April 7 report. 
Tax rates “especially matter for entrepreneurs and small businesses, which disproportionately represent the job creation and future potential of an economy. And while other taxes matter as well, income taxes garner headlines for a reason: They’re the most economically damaging taxes because they discourage work, savings and investment – the lifeblood of an economy,” Wingfield wrote.
David Schaefer, vice president of research and policy at the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said the state would be better off using the tax revenue to increase funding for the public school education formula and health care, especially since Georgia’s per-capita spending has been mostly flat for decades.
He cited analysis in a February report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy showing that people earning at least $75,000 disproportionately benefit from the 5.39% to 5.19% state tax reduction. 
The current structure of Georgia’s tax system causes those with the lowest incomes to pay a larger share of their earnings in state and local taxes than those with the highest incomes, Schaefer said. 
“We think that the tax cut from 5.39% the 5.19% is largely regressive,” he said. “Most of the benefits of that tax cut are going to go to the wealthiest Georgians.”

Menefee has served in the position since 2021. She oversees preventative and community health programs including epidemiology, vital statistics, regulation and the licensure of health-related professions and healthcare facilities and services.
“Leading and serving alongside the dedicated people at the Division of Public Health has been the greatest honor of my career,” Menefee said in a statement.
The Governor’s Office offered no information on interim leadership, saying details would come later.
Pillen said he appreciated Menefee’s public service, including in the military. Menefee recently retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee Air National Guard after 25 years. Prior to joining Nebraska’s DHHS, she served at the Knox County Health Department in Knoxville, Tennessee.
“Charity leaves public service with an impeccable record of dedication to the health and well-being of Nebraskans,” Pillen said. “Under her leadership, the division reduced processing times from 100 days to 25 for certain licenses and improved disease tracking capabilities throughout the state.”
Steve Corsi, CEO of DHHS, called Menefee a “shining example of a person who puts others first,” citing late-night meetings coordinating with stakeholders and weekends spent on operations tracking and containing infectious diseases.

Now his family wants to build 'a haven for families impacted by police violence.',"The family of Malik Jones gathered at the corner of Grand Avenue and Murphy Street in New Haven on Monday to unveil a plan to build what they called a “social justice institution” on the site where he was killed 28 years ago. 
The family is campaigning to raise $2.5 million to purchase an empty lot on the corner, where they plan to construct the building. 
According to a website dedicated to the project, the Malik Jones Social Justice Institution is designed to be “a haven for families impacted by police violence.” Jewu Richardson, the co-director of the Connecticut Bail Fund who was himself shot by a police officer, said that they wanted to create a place where community members could come together and grieve after a traumatic community loss. 
“When people get murdered by the police, they rally, they go to the police station and then they all go to their different corners of their neighborhood,” said Richardson. “Our goal is to build an institution, a building where if something like this happens, people can come straight here and there’ll be support for them here, where we can strategize and plan on how to address this situation. We don’t have to sit in silence and just deal with the trauma by ourselves.” 
On April 14, 1997, Jones, then 21, was pursued in a high-speed chase by Officer Robert Flodquist from East Haven into New Haven. At the corner of Murphy Street and Grand Avenue, police cars boxed in Jones’ vehicle. Flodquist broke the car window with the butt of his gun. When Jones shifted the car into reverse, Flodquist said he believed Jones was trying to run him over, and he shot at the car multiple times, killing Jones. 
A court ruled that the officers involved in the shooting had used “excessive force” but that they were entitled to qualified immunity, a principle that generally protects police officers from lawsuits unless their conduct violates a person’s “clearly established” right. The court did rule, however, that East Haven was liable for Jones’ killing because of the town’s “unconstitutional custom, policy, or usage of deliberate indifference against racial minorities.”
An appeals court later overturned the ruling on East Haven, saying the city was not responsible for Jones’ death.  
Emma Jones, Malik’s mother, said she was grateful for the amount of support she’d received from community members in the wake of her son’s death. She said she’d initially been told not to expect much, since her son was one of many people who had been killed by a police officer. 
“Well, not only did I get a lot of support for Malik, but I rallied with other people, and they got a lot of support for what happened to their loved one,” she said. 
Despite being awarded $2.5 million by one jury and $900,000 by a judge in 2010, Emma Jones said she’d never collected a cent of that money. Both decisions were later reversed by the courts. 
Jones referred to the future institution as a place of “pure joy.” She suggested that it might include a museum where people could learn about what happened to Malik, or a place that could host yoga or meditation. The website advertised “programs designed to educate, inspire, and galvanize community action against systemic injustice.”  
Richardson told The Connecticut Mirror that the family had been in discussion with the owner of the lot and that the owner seemed receptive to the idea. He also said Emma Jones had spoken to some members of the Board of Alders. 
The Board of Alders voted last year to rename the corner of Murphy Street and Grand Avenue the “Emma Jones Justice for Malik” corner. 
At the memorial service on Monday, friends and family of Malik shared stories and poems. 
Tawana Galberth, who attended high school with Malik, vividly remembers the day she heard about his death. She was sitting with some friends from school, watching footage of OJ Simpson being chased, when the program was interrupted by the breaking news that Jones had been shot and killed by an East Haven police officer.
“I went bananas,” she said. 
Galberth recalled meeting Malik Jones on her first day of high school. Her own brother had just died, and Jones, she said, reminded her of him. 
“Yes, we should all send all the money here to build a foundation to support what Malik stood for. Malik stood for righteousness. What he did in school … He wrote about nice things. He wrote about changing the community,” she said. 
“[Malik] wasn’t somebody out here in these streets, making a mess. He was somebody who could have been the next mayor, governor, president … he was robbed of his potential to be,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8481-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 16:09:38.921173

The Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles is reminding residents to ensure their driver’s license or identification card is REAL ID compliant ahead of a federal enforcement deadline set for May 7.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has confirmed the deadline will not be extended.
After that date, only REAL ID-compliant identification or other federally accepted forms, like a U.S. passport, will be accepted for boarding commercial flights, entering federal buildings, and accessing certain secure facilities.

REAL ID-compliant licenses and IDs are marked with a gold star in the upper right-hand corner.
According to the DMV, no further action is required for individuals who already have this gold star on their card.
Those without a compliant ID can visit any Delaware DMV location—no appointment necessary—to upgrade.
Required documentation includes proof of identity, Social Security number, two proofs of Delaware residency, and proof of any legal name changes.
A complete list is available here and here.
“With the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deadline of May 7, 2025, quickly approaching, now is the time to update your driver license if you plan on flying or need to enter a federal building. We encourage Delawareans to make an informed decision on whether a REAL ID is right for them and visit our website to learn more and make sure you have your required REAL ID documents before visiting a DMV location,” shared DelDOT Secretary Shanté Hastings.
DMV Director Amy Anthony noted that Delaware began issuing REAL ID cards in 2009 and estimates that approximately 85% of Delawareans are already compliant as of March 2025.
“Delaware was one of the first states to begin issuing REAL ID compliant DL/ID cards in 2009, resulting in approximately 85% of our residents being federally compliant as of March 2025. And remember, if you have the gold star on your license, you have your REAL ID,” Anthony said.
Passed by Congress in 2005, the REAL ID Act was designed to enhance national security by setting minimum standards for license issuance and production. Once fully enforced, federal agencies will not accept IDs that are not REAL ID compliant for official purposes.
Those without compliant identification could face delays, additional screening procedures, or be denied access to flights and federal facilities.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Secured_ID_DL.jpg,,,2025-04-15 16:09:38.921173

An Iowa company that transports Iowa-bred puppies is now embroiled in allegations of racketeering and money laundering and has been cited for the death of an animal in its care.
Subject Enterprise, based in the Hancock County town of Britt, was recently cited for one critical regulatory violation and issued a formal warning by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
Federal records show that Subject Enterprise, which is owned by Coda Subject, 34, of Britt, is the transport company used exclusively by the dog broker JAK’s Puppies, also located in Britt.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
JAK’s was sued by the state of Iowa in 2019 for its role in a puppy-laundering scheme that involved dogs sourced from puppy mills being falsely sold as rescue animals. Currently, both JAK’s and Subject Enterprise are being sued in California over claims of racketeering and money laundering due to similar allegations in that state.
According to veterinary inspection reports, a 10-week-old Havenese puppy died in March 2024 while being transported from JAK’s Puppies to a retail store in Washington state.
  This is the site of Subject Enterprise, a dog transporting company located in the rural Iowa town of Britt. (Photo courtesy of the Hancock County Assessor’s Office)
A recent APHIS inspector’s report says an unnamed representative of Subject Enterprise told the inspector they were “stuck in a blizzard” for part of the trip to Washington, but still checked on the animals every four hours. The report, however, also says this individual “stated they do not remember how often they checked this puppy, what its symptoms were and what was given to this puppy during the transport, but they stated they likely followed the same protocol they always do when a puppy starts to get ill during a transport.”
That protocol, according to the inspector’s report, calls for a driver to bring any sickened or distressed puppies to the front of the van and administer electrolytes or “stress drops” sourced from an animal broker’s attending veterinarian. Once stabilized, the puppies are to be given canned food and monitored more closely.
In this case, the inspector noted, Subject Enterprise has no documentation showing that any medical care was provided, and the puppy was never seen by a veterinarian on its way to Washington.
Subject Enterprise’s representative couldn’t recall when the puppy died, the inspector reported.  Failure to obtain veterinary care at the closest available veterinary facility “may have led to this puppy’s death,” the inspector reported.
Mindi Callison of the Iowa-based animal advocacy group Bailing Out Benji said regulators currently pay little attention to the third-party transport companies used by dog breeders and brokers.
“Transport companies are not licensed with the USDA, nor are they regularly inspected,” she said. “Companies must ‘register’ with the agency but generally run with zero oversight and lax regulations … Hundreds of transports are happening each week as puppies move from breeders to stores or customers along the way, but no one is making sure the conditions are safe and humane.”
Company cited four times over missed inspections
Although the puppy died in March 2024, Subject Enterprise was cited for the violation only this year — possibly due to  difficulties APHIS said it encountered when trying to inspect the company’s records.
In July 2024, an APHIS inspector reported she was unable to gain access to Subject Enterprise after receiving no response to “knocking, calling, texting and emailing.” Denial of access, she noted in her report, was a “serious violation” of the Animal Welfare Act and any future efforts to thwart inspections, she warned the company, “may result in enforcement action.”
In September 2024, the inspector returned and was again unable to gain access to the business after “knocking, calling and texting.” In November 2024, the inspector returned for a third time and again reported she was unable to gain access after “knocking, calling and texting” for 30 minutes with no response.
In December 2024, the APHIS inspector returned for a fourth time and again was unable conduct an inspection after calling, going to the business, knocking on the door and honking her car horn.
The Iowa-bred puppy that Subject Enterprise had shipped to Washington was bound for a retail store called Puppyland, which recently agreed to pay a $3.75 million settlement with the Washington attorney general’s office over its sales practices and its ties to puppy mills.
According to the attorney general’s office, Puppyland was misrepresenting the breeding standards of puppies it sold, failed to honor health guarantees, steered customers into predatory loans to purchase puppies, and used non-disparagement provisions in purchase agreements that illegally restricted truthful online reviews.
“Puppyland took advantage of people’s love for pets to maneuver them into taking on crushing debt for dogs with serious health issues, and then they tried to silence them,” Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in January.
Transporter accused of racketeering in lawsuit
In 2019, the Iowa attorney general sued JAK’s Puppies, which was founded by Jolyn Noethe and Kimberly Dolphin. The Iowa company was accused of “puppy laundering” in an effort to thwart a Chicago retail ban on dogs sourced from puppy mills. As a result of the attorney general’s lawsuit, the phony rescue operation that was involved, Rescue Pets Iowa, was forced to dissolve in October 2019.
In 2021, the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued JAK’s Puppies, Subject Enterprise, Rescue Pets Iowa, The Pet X Change, and other Iowa entities, in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The ALDF alleges the Iowa companies, in the wake of the 2019 case involving Chicago pet stores, conspired with others to pursue a similar scheme to illegally sell thousands of puppy-mill dogs to consumers in California through a separate, phony “rescue” operation.
The ALDF alleges JAK’s and the others created “an elaborate vertical scheme whereby each of the necessary steps in the puppy laundering — purchase from puppy mills, rebranding of puppies as rescues, transport of such rebranded puppies, and sale of such puppies to consumers through pet stores — was perpetrated by knowing co-conspirators/associates.”
The lawsuit claims one of the participants in that scheme is an Iowa company called TBHF, which does business as The Pet X Change and is located at Noethe’s personal residence in Britt. TBHF is accused of paying for the certificates of veterinary inspections needed to transfer puppies from Iowa to California.
State records show Subject Enterprise, which trucked the puppies into California, is owned by Noethe’s nephew, Coda Subject. “Subject Enterprise is intimately linked with JAK’s,” the lawsuit alleges, claiming the transport company uses vehicles it acquired from JAK’s just weeks after incorporating and is operating on loans guaranteed by Noethe and Dolphin.
Each of the shipments handled by Subject Enterprise were “grueling, 30-plus hour affairs for the weeks-old puppies transported from Iowa to California,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that according to Subject Enterprise records, one chihuahua died after being dropped, another died in a truck on the west coast, and a pet store later refused to pay for a puppy that had died in transit.
The defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing. A jury trial is scheduled for Feb. 17, 2026.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Democratic lawmakers in Washington are beginning to lay out the buffet of tax increases they want to use to fill most of a $16 billion state budget shortfall.
There are hikes in business and capital gains taxes, new sales taxes on services and greater property tax collections by the state and local governments.
Other selections include an increase in a surcharge on technology companies, an expanded tax on nicotine products, and a mandate for some large businesses to make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax owed to the state. 
Major financial institutions will pay a little more, too. And there’s a surcharge on corporations with more than $250 million in annual revenue that starts Jan. 1, 2026, and lasts four years. Among those exempted from that surcharge is Boeing. 
A pivotal question now is whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson endorses the slate of tax measures. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, House and Senate Democrats rolled out separate packages to raise up to $21 billion.
But Ferguson threw cold water on their desire to tax those with more than $50 million, a pillar in both approaches. The governor said this proposal was “untested, difficult to implement, and most importantly, for purposes of adopting a sustainable budget, will face an immediate challenge in court.”
That sent legislators searching for new options. They came up with a whole bunch. 
They also discarded a payroll tax modeled on Seattle’s JumpStart tax that would have been levied on companies with large payrolls and highly-paid employees. This was another central plank in their earlier tax plans.
The new approach still relies on many of the state’s corporate and banking giants to pay more. 
It also still targets wealthier individual taxpayers with the addition of a second tier of the state’s capital gains tax, which took effect in 2022 and has been upheld in court.
Washington imposes a 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests. Senate Bill 5813 and House Bill 2082 call for a new 9.9% tax on gains greater than $1 million, an idea Senate Democrats discussed in December.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)After scraping by with razor-thin support last session and pending questions about its legality, Maine’s 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases is before lawmakers again as Republicans seek to repeal it. 
Last session, the Legislature passed a bill requiring a three-day waiting period after someone purchases a gun before they can bring it home as part of a slew of gun safety legislation in the aftermath of the deadly Lewiston mass shooting. The law is currently suspended amid a legal challenge questioning its constitutionality, but legislators are still seeking to do away with it in Maine statute.
After lawmakers voted to enact the bill 73-70 in the House of Representatives and 18-17 in the Senate, Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who has a history of support for gun rights, allowed it to become law but did not endorse it with her signature. At the time, she said she was conflicted over what she saw as the burden it placed on law-abiding citizens, while also understanding the argument that it could save lives by preventing impulsive suicides and homicides.
After the waiting period took effect in August, opponents filed a lawsuit in November claiming it violates the Second Amendment rights of people who have passed background checks. 
Earlier this year, a U.S. District Court judge sided with the gun rights advocates and temporarily paused the waiting period. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey appealed the decision, but a federal appeals court last week refused to reinstate the waiting period while the lawsuit unfolds. 
Meanwhile, the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee is set to hold a public hearing Wednesday morning for two proposals to repeal the law entirely. Both bills would repeal the portion of Maine statute that requires someone who sells a firearm to wait 72 hours before delivering it to the buyer. 
LD 208 is sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), while the nearly identical LD 1230 is sponsored by Rep. Quentin Chapman (R-Auburn).
The committee will also hear a proposal from Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) to roll back another gun reform measure passed last session: background checks on the private sales of firearms. 
Specifically, LD 1062 would repeal a law that was part of a slate of reforms introduced by Mills in response to the Lewiston shooting that expanded background checks to advertised sales. 
During last year’s House discussion ahead of the floor vote on the bill, proponents said it closed a loophole in Maine’s background check law without requiring universal background checks — which Mainers narrowly voted down in a 2016 referendum. But opponents argued it was an infringement of Second Amendment rights that would only further burden law-abiding citizens.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signaled Tuesday he would veto the legislation, which he said would have the effect of firing agency heads who don’t live in Tallahassee.
Proposals that a Senate panel approved unanimously Tuesday and the House could vote on Wednesday would end remote work for agency heads and other appointees of the governor by Oct. 1.
“They’re saying all the agency heads must live in the swamp,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Pensacola. “I want to drain the swamp; I don’t want to refill the swamp. Where are they getting this? It’s an asinine proposal.”
While the governor’s bashing was aimed at the House, the Senate is also moving forward with the proposal.
“They’re pulling it out of their rear ends and trying to jam it through this process. Over my veto pen,” DeSantis said.
Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s bill, SB 1760, additionally would require university trustees and members of the Board of Governors to be U,S. citizens and state residents. Trustees must be alumni of the university they’re appointed to and members of the board must be alumni of a state university if they don’t live in the state.
The Republican senator said she wasn’t trying to target any specific agency heads with her proposal.
“We have agencies that have leaders — the secretary or the executive director, or the chief administrative officer — who need to be present. This is to further the conversation about what does this mean,” Grall said during the Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government meeting.
She added: “If they choose to live in another place, should we be reimbursing the cost of that travel?”
Scrutiny for outsiders
Trustees must move to Florida by Jan. 6, 2027, to keep their posts under the proposal. New College of Florida Trustee Christopher Rufo is an example of a DeSantis appointee who is neither a Florida resident nor an alumnus, yet has helped lead the governor’s culture war on higher education at the Sarasota institution.
Most recently, a panel of senators recommended against confirmation of one of DeSantis’ nominees for the University of West Florida Board of Trustees. Lawmakers criticized Adam Kissell, a Heritage Foundation fellow, for living in West Virginia.
“I think that it’s unfortunate when you look at the number of trustees that that are on our slate for confirmation, and you look at where a lot of them are from, and you look at one individual, particularly, who is not even from our state,” said Republican Sen. Jay Trumbull, who represents the area, during the March 27 panel.
Kissel has faced criticism for advocating defunding of public universities and suggesting the GI bill led to over-enrolled four-year colleges.
While the Senate bill has to get through one more committee, the House version, HB 1445, from Melbourne Republican Rep. Debbie Mayfield, is up on the floor this week.
House wants to stop politicking from state employees

A provision prohibiting unelected state employees from conducting campaign-type activities while they’re working is missing from the Senate version of the bill.
Under Mayfield’s proposal, state employees couldn’t participate in political campaigns, solicit contributions, or use their authority to influence people’s votes. Those prohibitions would apply both to candidate and issue campaigns, and employees could face a first-degree misdemeanor penalties if they do so.
The move from the House comes after NBC News reported that state employees in the governor’s office called lobbyists to request donations for a political committee aligned with DeSantis as he and the First Lady hinted that she was mulling a run for governor.
State employees also engaged in activities that could be banned when they joined DeSantis’ campaign against last year’s ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and protect abortion access.
Both Ladapo and Jason Weida, former secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, were targets of lawsuits over the health department’s letters threatening broadcasters that aired ads on behalf of the pro-abortion-rights campaign, Amendment 4. The surgeon general also appeared in press conferences against the passage of the marijuana constitutional amendment.
AHCA’s creation of a webpage stating that Amendment 4 “threatens women’s safety” and Weida’s promotion of it prompted a complaint to the Florida Supreme Court, which ultimately sided with the DeSantis administration because the plaintiff lacked standing.

(Photo courtesy of the Des Moines Fire Department)Iowa House lawmakers unanimously passed a bill expanding cancer coverage for emergency responders in Iowa, sending it to the governor.
House File 969 expands disability and death benefits for firefighters, emergency medical services responders and law enforcement officers from the current 14 cancers covered to all types of cancer. The bill also proposes changes to contribution rates for the Peace Officers’ Retirement, Accident, and Disability System (PORS), the Municipal Fire and Police Retirement System of Iowa (411 System) and the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS) — the retirement programs for these public workers — in part to finance this expanded coverage.
Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, celebrated the bill making it to Gov. Kim Reynolds after failing to advance in the Senate in previous sessions.

“Finally, after six subcommittees, six committee votes, and what will be our fourth and hopefully final floor vote, we are finally going to get this bill for cancer coverage, screening for first responders down to the governor’s desk,” Kaufmann said.
The bill passed the Senate earlier in April with an amendment making minor changes to contribution rates, and only one “no” vote, from Sen. Jason Schultz, R-Schleswig. The final House vote was greeted with a standing ovation from lawmakers and supporters of the legislation in the gallery.
Kaufmann thanked Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, for leading the bill in the other chamber.
“I think it’s important also to know that we, as a House body, can pass this bill as many times as we want, but without a senator being willing to take up and run with it, it wasn’t going to happen,” he said. “And so I would be remiss if I did not thank Senator Scott Webster, who took this bill on, didn’t take no for an answer and got this back to us.”
He also thanked Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, for his work to pass the bipartisan measure. Turek spoke in support of the measure, saying this expansion of coverage will help the state better care for its workers responding to emergencies throughout the state.
“This is what we are here to do, is to take care of our citizens, protect our citizens, and particularly our heroes,” Turek said.
Some supporters, including firefighters, law enforcement officers and their families, sat in the gallery as the House passed the measure. Turek said he was “grateful that this is the last time you have to come back.” Kaufmann also thanked emergency responders for their efforts to move the bill forward.
“For the folks that are up in the gallery — each and every day, at any given moment, you lay down your lives or are willing to, for all of us,” Kaufmann said. “This is the least we can do, is finally get this across the finish line.”

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The leading Democrat in the South Carolina Senate has invited President Donald Trump to tour BMW’s Upstate manufacturing facility.
Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto of Orangeburg introduced the resolution Tuesday extending “a formal invitation to the president of the United States to visit the plant and witness firsthand its impact on the Palmetto State and the nation.”
The invitation follows remarks by White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro on CNBC last week criticizing the German automaker because it imports many of the parts it uses in its X series vehicles built in Spartanburg County.
“This business model where BMW and Mercedes come in to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions — that doesn’t work for America,” Navarro said. (Mercedes is actually located in the Lowcountry, while BMW is in Greer, roughly halfway between Spartanburg and Greenville.)
“It’s bad for our economics,” he continued. “It’s bad for our national security. We want them to come here.”
Tariff-induced trade war could spell double trouble for SC auto industry

Navarro was on national television discussing the Trump administration’s 10% global tariffs and 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and proposed 25% tariffs on imported auto parts, which are scheduled to go into effect May 3.
“When I heard the criticism, it dawned on me maybe they don’t know what they’re talking about,” Hutto said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “BMW is a jewel for South Carolina. It’s not a scam. And if people in Washington don’t understand that, I invite them to come down here and take a look.”
While none of the six counties Hutto represents is in the Upstate, there are BMW suppliers in his district, he noted, demonstrating the company’s statewide reach.
“When somebody does something that affects the entire state, I think it’s important that we say something about it,” he said.
The resolution went on to cite the $14.8 billion invested by BMW and the 5 million vehicles produced in Greer since the plant opened in the early 1990s.
It was sent to the Senate Education Committee for review.
U.S. Rep. William Timmons, who represents Greenville and Spartanburg counties in Congress, also weighed in on X, formerly Twitter, last week following Navarro’s remarks.
“As the representative of SC-04, home to BMW USA and the tens of thousands of people it employs both directly and indirectly, I can assure you that BMW is good for South Carolina and America,” Timmons wrote April 7.
Gov. Henry McMaster, too, called BMW “a great company.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Checking out some books through local libraries could soon cost more than a standard library card fee.
Libraries were instructed Monday to immediately suspend use of the state’s interlibrary loan courier program. 
The courier service transports books and other library materials across South Dakota from the libraries that have them to those that don’t, typically faster and more efficiently than would be possible though the U.S. Postal Service. 
The State Library relies on federal funding from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to pay for the program.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing the head of that federal agency — which provides a federal grant that funds around half of the South Dakota State Library’s services — to cut its operations to the “maximum extent allowable by law.” 
State Library faces Trump threat to federal funding after escaping the Noem knife

Former Gov. Kristi Noem sought to cut state library funding in her proposed budget to a level too low for the state to continue receiving federal matching funds. The state Legislature, however, approved a pared-back library budget large enough for the state to maintain access to about $1.4 million in IMLS funding.
While South Dakota hasn’t gotten confirmation its funding is cut, Department Secretary Joe Graves told the state Board of Education Standards on Monday, the federal government notified other states they’re receiving cuts.
“South Dakota, at least to my knowledge as of 8 a.m. this morning, hasn’t heard. So we don’t know what’s going on with that,” Graves said Monday.
Email to librarians signals service loss
The State Library cannot renew the contract with its interlibrary loan courier service at the end of April because of “uncertainty” about funding, according to an email sent to librarians that same day, which was reviewed by South Dakota Searchlight.
The education department did not immediately respond to a request to verify the email, for details on why it was sent, or for any other impacts to the State Library expected as a result of the Trump executive order.
Department of Education Spokeswoman Nancy Van Der Weide told South Dakota Searchlight recently that “we do not have a clear indication” of what might happen with future grant funding.
Congress authorized grant funding through federal fiscal year 2025. The department “is waiting on a grant award” for 2025, Van Der Weide wrote in an email last month.
Libraries could charge for, limit service
About 70% of South Dakota libraries share books with each other through interlibrary loan, according to the State Library website. Without the courier service, local libraries and governments will need to pay to ship books to other libraries across the state, according to South Dakota Library Association President Elizabeth Fox. That costs an average of $5 an item each way, she said.
To pick up the new cost, local libraries could limit how many interlibrary loans an individual can make, or charge a fee when someone requests an interlibrary loan.
“Each library will have to determine how they deal with this,” Fox said.
Hill City Public Library Director Tammy Alexander plans to discuss the impact with members of her library’s board of directors next week. She sent requested books through the mail yesterday to Brookings and Chamberlain libraries.
“Like all budgets right now, even our small city budget will have cuts for 2026,” Alexander said. “My board will have to decide if they’ll allow me to include that.”
Trump order would gut agency that gives library grants to SD

The State Library also pays for subscription-based academic databases, accessible at no cost through any public library in the state. It also provides support for summer reading programs, organizes professional development workshops, and offers Braille and talking book services for readers with disabilities.
Noem’s proposed cut would have pared down services to those last two items. 
‘This is disheartening,’ lawmaker says
Lawmakers softened budget cuts this winter with the expectation they’d budgeted enough money to preserve the IMLS federal grant funding. The plan spared the jobs of all but 3.5 State Library employees, but dissolved the board that oversees the State Library.
Rep. Terri Jorgenson, R-Piedmont, worked closely with the Education Department on the compromise.
“After all our hard work we put into this to restructure and save this program, this is disheartening,” Jorgenson said.
Interlibrary loans are crucial for homeschool students as well as students in public and private schools, she told South Dakota Searchlight on Tuesday. Burdening local governments with shipping costs and potentially passing the cost onto families will add up quickly.
Jorgenson and other lawmakers will need to explore funding options for library programming in the wake of the news, she said.
“Ultimately, this means we’re going to have to get creative,” Jorgenson said, “to save money and work to still provide this important service.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 18:53:53+00:00,CT Mirror,Marissa Gillett gets Senate OK for second term as PURA chair,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/pura-chair-marissa-gillett-confirmed/,Marissa Gillett was confirmed to a second 4-year term as PURA chair Tuesday after Senate Republicans walked out before the vote in protest.,"The head of Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority was confirmed to a second four-year term on Tuesday, despite a walkout from Senate Republicans in protest of a purported deal to secure political support for her reappointment.
Marissa Gillett, who has led PURA since 2019, was confirmed by a vote of 21-0 in the Senate with none of the chamber’s 11 Republicans participating.
Tuesday’s vote was the final step in a months-long confirmation process that has seen Gillett face attacks from both Republicans and the state’s largest utilities over her leadership style as well as the state’s chronically high electric rates. The House voted largely along party lines to advance Gillett’s nomination last week. 
It was another allegation, however, that led Senate Republicans to take what they said was the “unprecedented” step Tuesday of walking out of the chamber ahead of the vote. 
In February, as Gillett was facing a pivotal hearing before the legislature’s Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office announced a deal to appoint one of the committee’s members, state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, to one of two open seats on PURA in order to clear the way for her nomination to proceed. Fonfara, who had previously expressed reservations about Gillett’s tenure, ultimately voted to advance her nomination out of the committee.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, called that deal a “blatant quid pro quo” on Tuesday and went as far as to suggest it violated state’s bribery laws. 
“We will not allow our constituents’ vote to be complicit in what has gone on here,” Harding told a gaggle of reporters shortly before the party staged its walkout. “The governor’s office is wrong. Anyone else that was involved in this is wrong, and our constituents should not have to have us be complicit in any of this.”

Harding later made similar comments on the Senate floor before joining the rest of his colleagues in the GOP’s caucus chambers while Democrats quickly proceeded with the vote to approve Gillett’s appointment.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, characterized the Republicans’ walkout as an attempt to “smear” Gillett, whom he said has been effective at scrutinizing Connecticut’s utilities and keeping their rates in check.
“There’s a lot of money on the line to make sure she doesn’t get back in,” Duff said. “People are looking at her nationally because she’s a change agent. She’s actually won in court against utility companies … and so I think that there’s just been this tremendous amount of just bad information that’s come out” regarding her tenure.
Lamont’s spokesman, Rob Blanchard, released a statement later Tuesday criticizing the Republicans’ actions.
“Senate Republicans chose to completely abdicate their responsibility today by talking a walk and not voting on their confirmation — a purely political move that doesn’t match their concerns about addressing utility costs,” Blanchard said. “Despite the political theater, the Governor looks forward to working collaboratively to find policy solutions needed to have a lasting impact on delivering cheaper energy for the people of our state.”

Gillett declined to comment directly on the Republicans’ walkout Tuesday but released a statement through a PURA spokesperson thanking Lamont and lawmakers for their support throughout her confirmation process.
“Serving as the chair of PURA for the past several years has been an honor, and I look forward to continuing my service on behalf of the state and its ratepayers,” Gillett said.
The governor’s deal to appoint Fonfara became the subject of further scrutiny last month after press reports revealed Fonfara’s ownership in several energy-related companies that had previous run-ins with regulators at PURA, including racking up more than $1 million in fines.
Fonfara has denied any wrongdoing while accusing Gillett of retaliating against him for speaking out against legislation that would have broadened her powers in 2023.
On Tuesday, he recused himself from the final vote on her nomination. 
Fonfara later told a reporter that “a lot has changed” since his decision to support Gillett’s nomination in committee but said he wasn’t wrong to cast that vote, even though he recused himself from the full Senate vote today.
“What I voted I believed in, but like I said, a lot has changed since then,” he said.
Fonfara declined to respond to Republicans’ allegations regarding the deal to appoint him to a seat on PURA in the future.
The Senate also voted Tuesday to confirm a second PURA nominee, David Arconti of Brookfield. Republicans opted to participate in that vote, and Arconti, a former state representative and lobbyist for United Illuminating, was approved by a mostly party-line vote of 23-7.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s veto of a bill creating state funds for post-fire recovery and current wildfire suppression “deeply disappointed” House Bill 191 sponsor Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), who is also one of the state budget’s main architects. 
Lujan Grisham said the $12 million the bill authorized didn’t provide enough money to even “put a dent” in post-wildfire recovery. Recovery from South Fork and Salt fires and ensuing floods last year in Ruidoso, for example, will cost more than $200 million, the governor noted in her veto message. 
Lujan Grisham also wrote that another new fund the bill created, designed to pay for the state’s wildfire suppression efforts, had no money in it at all and instead would have relied on federal reimbursements, “which have only gotten slower in recent months.”
Lawmakers approved the HB191 amid concerns about the federal government’s capacity to suppress wildfires in New Mexico and elsewhere, thanks to federal funding cuts, and as the state beefs up its own crews of full-time and volunteer wildland firefighters. Also, most of New Mexico is experiencing above-average wildfire potential this month and through the rest of the summer, according to the latest forecasts. 
‘It’s bad’: How drought, lack of snowpack and federal cuts could spell wildfire disaster in NM

Small, who chairs the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, told Source New Mexico in a statement Monday that the governor’s veto was not just disappointing but also surprising given that the governor’s office was involved in crafting the legislation. 
As for her specific objections, Small said the $12 million was a “starting point” that nonetheless would have “made a significant difference to New Mexicans who will face the devastating impacts of the next wildfires in our state.”
He also noted that while the governor vetoed the bill, she left its accompanying $12 million appropriation intact in the budget. As a result, money will “now sit unused” instead of helping communities respond and recover from wildfires, he said. 
“Unfortunately, New Mexicans will pay the price for the lack of action this year, but my colleagues and I will continue to fight to protect our communities from the catastrophic wildfires that continue to threaten our people, businesses, and lands.”
Source has a pending request to the governor’s office to respond to Small’s comments and will update this story as necessary. 
State Forester Laura McCarthy, whose agency would have received the post-fire funds defended the concept behind HB191 as a way to budget for wildfire suppression, taking climate change into account and also preserving the governor’s ability to issue executive orders to pay for wildfire suppression on a case-by-case basis. 
But she also agreed with the governor’s criticism of the way HB191 created a fire suppression fund without putting any money in it.
“The Governor’s veto message made clear that without funding for HB191, creating a wildfire suppression fund that relies on federal reimbursements or payments for state crews when they are on out-of-state assignments, does not set the program up for success,” she said in an emailed statement.  
NM wildfire outlook above normal for most of state

Without the legislation, the state will have to pay for any costs to suppress wildfires this year through the use of executive orders, McCarthy said. The Forestry Division has said that is the wrong way for the state to proactively anticipate and budget for the “volatile but predictable expense” of wildfire suppression. Executive orders are handled on a case-by-case basis and capped at $750,000 at a time, often requiring multiple orders for the same natural disaster.
McCarthy also said recruitment of state wildland firefighters is “going well,” and the state is anticipating full staffing ahead of increased wildfire activity expected in May and June.
Despite the veto, Lujan Grisham noted that she signed Senate Bill 33, which creates guidelines and criteria for a new Wildfire Prepared Program, including grants and certifications for property owners to make structures less prone to wildfire damage. The governor said that bill achieves “similar objectives” to HB 191.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After an intense debate, a divided Senate Education Committee advanced a bill that would allow public schools to hire candidates with no college degree or training to teach early childhood classes.
House Bill 2125 passed in a 6-5 vote on Tuesday, despite opposition from the committee’s leadership. The legislation, which already passed the House, is now eligible for consideration by the full Senate.
Supporters of the bill advocated for increasing flexibility for school leaders struggling to staff classrooms amid a teacher shortage. Senators who voted against the bill warned there could be a long-term negative effect on students if they have an untrained adjunct teacher during their foundational years of schooling.
Adjunct teachers aren’t required to have any college education nor any form of educator training. They are defined in state law as people “with distinguished qualifications in their field” who are allowed to teach in schools full time.
The Senate committee approved an amendment to HB 2125 that would require adjunct candidates to complete a training on the science of reading by the end of their second year teaching if they are hired to an early childhood education program.
This mirrors a training requirement that applies to emergency certified teachers working in pre-K through third grade classrooms. Teacher candidates must have at least a bachelor’s degree to receive an emergency certification, though they might not have any formal teacher training.
The bill’s senate author, Sen. Kendal Sacchieri, R-Blanchard, said she hopes schools will use adjunct teachers sparingly for early elementary grades but believes “there are some out there that can do the job superbly” despite lacking certification.
“If that is an option, I want to make sure my (superintendent) can utilize it short term,” Sacchieri said while debating in favor of her legislation.
Anderson Public School Superintendent Todd Williams urged the committee to pass the bill. During the committee meeting, he said he’s had teaching aides who were ready to handle their own classrooms while working toward earning a certification.
Adding a requirement for science of reading training makes the legislation “a home run,” Williams said.
But, the committee’s chairperson, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, and vice chairperson, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, said lowering qualifications for educators isn’t a solution to the teacher shortage nor will it improve Oklahoma’s poor reading and math levels.
Pre-K through third grade is “the most vulnerable time in a child’s educational journey,” Pugh said, as children begin to learn to read and understand numbers.
“We know for a fact that a qualified man or woman inside of a classroom in Oklahoma is the foundation and the most important thing in a child’s educational experience when they step into that (school) building,” Pugh said. “I would much rather take the very best teacher and give them 100 kids than take a bad teacher and give them 20.”
All three Democrats on the committee joined Pugh and Seifried in opposition to the bill.
One of the Democratic lawmakers, Sen. Carri Hicks, of Oklahoma City, is a former kindergarten and first grade teacher. Hicks said she was “disturbed” by the proposal.
“I would contend that while I had the motivation and while I wanted to do what was best for my students, the thing that made me an effective early childhood educator is my master’s in early childhood (education),” Hicks said.

SPRINGFIELD — For over 65 years, Bernice and Frank Monteleone have been raising minks on their farm in Elgin. The couple bought their first mink in 1959 — a red female who was pregnant at the time. She quickly produced seven babies, or kits.

“Before then, I had never seen a mink before in my life,” Bernice Monteleone said.

The couple traded those kits for minks from a neighboring farmer and began to breed them. That one female mink led the family to raise around 30,000 minks at the height of their production. In turn, the farm financially supported all the couple’s children and their families throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

“It has been a really wonderful way of life,” she said. “We’ve raised six kids here and a bunch of grandkids, and they learned good work habits and things like that from it, too. We really enjoyed that kind of life.”

Although the industry has self-imposed guidelines farmers adhere to in order to sell their pelts legally, mink farming is not regulated at the federal level or in Illinois.

But a bill in play in Springfield could change that. House Bill 2627, sponsored by Rep. Joyce Mason, D-Gurnee, would regulate the mink industry at the state level, creating mink farm licensing and requirements. But proponents and opponents have two vastly different opinions on what the bill really aims to do.

“This is not a ‘save the minks’ bill,” Mason said in a House Public Health Committee hearing earlier this session.  “It is not one of those bills. It is a bill that is very much about public health. It does not intend to close mink farms or provide any undue burden to them.”

Mason testified during the hearing alongside Chris Green, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, and Marc Ayers, Illinois director of the Humane Society of the United States, who all warned of the potential public health risks mink farms pose.

But Bernice Monteleone and Challis Hobbs, executive director of Fur Commission USA, disagree. They say the bill’s main goal is to ban the mink industry, and that the requirements outlined in the bill are impossible for farmers to adhere to.

“I don’t know if it’s ignorance, or if, in my opinion, it is them trying to push us out of business,” Hobbs said in an interview. “Because these same proponents tried to pass a bill last year to ban us, so that’s what it looks like.”

What the bill would do

Hobbs and Monteleone’s opinion, the bill is yet another attempt to shut the industry down.

“There’s not much doubt in my mind that they’re just trying to get rid of it,” Hobbs said, referring to the mink farming industry. “When I read these things and how they’ve written this bill, obviously, it’s not someone who’s been in agriculture or they just want to put us out of business.”

But Mason maintains the bill’s intention is to protect public health.

“This isn’t even about mink welfare, it’s about health,” Mason said in an interview. “My goal is not to shut them down at all. It's just to make sure that they're not breeding viruses.”

HB2627 is supported by the Animal Legal Defense Fund, the Humane Society of the United States, and the Animal Welfare Institute. It is opposed by such groups as the Fur Commission USA, the Illinois Farm Bureau, and the Illinois Trappers Association.

The bill passed a House committee in March but was never called for a vote in the full House before an April 11 deadline. However, if passed into law, HB2627 would create a mink farming license, requiring farmers to disclose their location, the number of staff they employ, and the number of minks they house.

“To our knowledge, only four fur farms exist in this state, just four,” bill proponent Marc Ayers, Illinois director of the Humane Society of the United States, said in committee.

However, Monteleone said she’s not sure there are even that many fur farms in the state.

“I'm not even aware of four, to be honest with you,” Monteleone said. “We used to communicate quite a bit before, but the industry has gotten much smaller.”

Hobbs said the transparency of farm locations poses a safety risk to farmers. They say the locations of mink farms are kept relatively secret on purpose – to protect both mink farmers and their animals from anti-fur activists, who often break into farms and set caged minks free. Hobbs said minks usually die within 24-48 hours of their release and that activists have released over 50,000 commercially raised minks in the past few years.

“Our concern is, if they do this and those extremist activists get their hands on that information and attack them, it’ll be terrible,” Hobbs said. “It's going to hurt the farmers. It's going hurt the animals and hurt the environment.”

The bill also requires farmers to pay an annual license fee of $1,000, which would be used for two annual inspections of mink farms, among other things. It also sets several requirements that farmers must meet if their minks show signs of infection.

One of those requirements would be that farmers test enough of their minks weekly for COVID, bird flu or any other “potentially harmful virus.”  Farmers would also have to test all their staff for viruses as well.

Those testing requirements, Hobbs said, would put a large financial burden on small mink farmers. According to him, the industry voluntarily participated in a national USDA program where they tested minks and farm employees for viruses. Between the costs of labor and sample collection from that program, they estimated the testing would cost farmers over $160,000 per year.

If any of the minks or workers on a farm test positive, the bill would require farmers to quarantine all their workers and separate their minks from one another by six feet. Hobbs said this separation would be “impossible” to achieve on any commercial farm – as commercially raised minks live in rows of small wire cages, placed side by side.

“They want you to separate the mink six feet apart. You can't. There's no livestock where you can do that,” Hobbs said. “I promise you, if this bill was proposed for any other industry, you’d have every powerful lobbyist group there in two seconds, because the regulations on this are crazy.”

Another provision would mandate that farmers euthanize their minks “if euthanasia of the mink is necessary for disease containment.” Currently, poultry farmers who have to euthanize their birds due to bird flu are eligible for reimbursements through the USDA’s indemnity program. In an interview, Mason said she expects the Illinois Department of Agriculture would also reimburse mink farmers who have to euthanize their minks.

Green, of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, pointed out that the federal law regulating animal farming exempts minks from the classification of “farm animals,” which are under authority of the USDA.

Green served as the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Program until 2023. He was the main author of a 170-page report that assessed the rates and risks of animals spreading diseases to humans in the United States, including among minks raised on farms.

“Because fur-bearing animals are not considered livestock, producers are not eligible for indemnity payments from the USDA if their animals are culled because of a disease outbreak,” the Harvard report read. “As a result, producers have little incentive to report disease outbreaks for fear of financial losses.”

Hobbs said the industry has been in talks with the federal Department of Agriculture about potentially developing an indemnity program for mink farmers, but “it didn't look like there was too much appetite for it.”

Another concern Monteleone and Hobbs share is that licensing  would be overseen by the Illinois Department of Public Health. They say the Illinois Department of Agriculture would be better suited to oversee the issue.

Minks and infectious diseases

Minks are part of the mustelid family of animals, which includes other carnivorous mammals like badgers, wolverines, otters, weasels and ferrets. The New York Times Magazine reported these animals have respiratory systems that are like humans – so similar that scientists often use them as subjects in experiments designed to study respiratory diseases like coronaviruses.

In the committee hearing, Mason said that fact is extremely relevant now, especially with bird flu infection rates on the rise.

“In the case of mink, we know that they also had COVID before it was transmitted to humans,” she said. “They are now experiencing avian flu, and they are very likely to become vectors of future diseases, which could lead to pandemics.”

So far, the CDC has only confirmed one case of an American mink with bird flu, but the history of minks contracting and spreading COVID is what worries Mason.

During the pandemic, humans infected many different types of animals with the virus, including captive minks living on mink farms. But the CDC says that only four types of animals gave the virus back to humans – and minks were one of those animals.

Although the CDC maintains that the current public health risk for humans is low, the concern is that interaction between the seasonal flu virus and the bird flu virus might create a new strain that could start human-to-human transmissions. This would likely increase the risk of another pandemic, officials said.

“The real concern is that as these diseases move through these populations and jump from species to species to species again, especially with minks’ respiratory system being so similar to ours,” Green said. “If one of those deadly mutated versions gets to mink, then it's highly likely that it's going spread to humans.”

Since minks are naturally independent and free-roaming animals, Green said being kept in a cage is very stressful for them. And because higher rates of stress have been proven to lower immune responses, he said that leaves the animals more susceptible to disease.

But John Easley, a Wisconsin-based veterinarian who specializes in minks, disagrees. He said minks have been bred to thrive in and adapt to commercial farm settings since the 1940s.

“In most cases, I don't feel that the animals are under stress, undue stress, compared to any other animal that's raised in a commercial setting,” he said in an interview.

Hobbs, the Fur Commission executive director, said Green and Mason are making a bigger deal about the risk of the bird flu spreading in minks than necessary.

“You can go to the CDC and USDA websites and it will literally say that mink farms did not play a significant role in spreading COVID-19,” Hobbs said. “The bottom line is that the health authorities are saying that we are low risk. Maybe the proponents are saying that we're not, but that's kind of where we differ.”

He said Fur Commission USA is currently working with United States Department of Agriculture to develop a bird flu vaccine for minks, just as it worked with the department to develop a COVID vaccine for minks during the pandemic – which Easley said approximately 92% of the U.S. commercial herd received.

Minks, Denmark and COVID

Since U.S. mink farms aren’t regulated, there is no state or national database that discloses where farms are or how many minks they house. When an outbreak of coronavirus occurred in mink farms in Wisconsin, the state government was unaware how many farms were in the state and had no direct way to reach them. The Wisconsin State Veterinarian had to contact Fur Commission USA to get in touch with the state’s mink farmers.

According to the Harvard study, 18 fur farms across four U.S. states experienced an outbreak during the pandemic. One mink farm in Michigan experienced an outbreak that resulted in a small number of workers testing positive for a strain of the virus the CDC said, “contained unique mink-related mutations.”

The New York Times Magazine reported that in Denmark, more minks were infected with COVID than humans during the pandemic. The virus mutated in the minks, resulting in a new strain that infected workers on the farms, which prompted the Danish prime minister to order a mass slaughter of the country’s roughly 17,000 commercially farmed minks.

A CDC webpage about minks and COVID states there is no evidence that minks played a “significant role” in the spread of the virus to humans, but that “there is a possibility” the minks spread the virus to workers. It also notes mink-to-human COVID-19 transmission was reported in Europe and data suggests it might have also happened in the U.S.

But the virus wasn’t confined to minks on mink farms. Minks regularly escape farms or are released by anti-fur activists. Those escaped minks then infect wild minks and other animals they encounter, allowing the diseases to spread and mutate among other wild animals.

In August 2020, the CDC identified coronavirus outbreaks on mink farms in Wisconsin, Utah, Michigan, and Oregon. That month, the CDC launched a wildlife investigation near two Utah mink farms that had experienced outbreaks. The report says officials captured and tested 102 mammals – including 78 rodents, 11 presumed escaped minks, two presumed wild minks, five raccoons, and six skunks.

Although no wild animals tested positive for the coronavirus, all 11 escaped minks tested positive and the potential of escaped minks spreading the disease to the wildlife population was labelled by the CDC as “concerning.”
How mink farms currently operate

Mason said the main goal of her bill is to create state-level regulations for the mink farming industry to ensure farmers take precautions to contain potential viral outbreaks.

Although she acknowledged the industry has self-made regulations, she said her concern is that there’s no way to enforce those regulations.

Monteleone and Hobbs disagree.

Hobbs explained that a professional certification organization – who certifies audit systems for all types of animal farms, including audits for mink farms – certified the Fur Commission’s industry standards and audit tool, which spans 130 pages. The Fur Commission then took the standards from that tool and created the Humane Care Certification Program, which they use to certify mink farms.

Since the regulations aren’t mandated at a state or federal level, the Fur Commission’s program is voluntary for mink farmers. But Hobbs explained that farmers have virtually no other options than to go through the organization if they want to sell any pelts they raise, as American mink farmers can only sell their pelts through two international auction houses that will only buy pelts from farmers who are certified.

“As of today, just over 96% of the mink pelts produced in the U.S. comes from these certified farms,” Hobbs said.

Fur Commission USA essentially serves as a middleman between the auction houses and mink farmers: communicating the industry standards to farmers, setting up contact between third-party auditors and farmers, and administering the certifications to farms that meet all the regulations and requirements.

Monteleone echoed Hobbs’ statements, saying any pelts farmers want to sell through the auction houses must have approval from Fur Commission USA before the houses will buy them.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)With Americans observing Tax Day on Tuesday, a Florida Democrat joined with a progressive group at the Capitol to call for the Legislature to embrace a form of taxation known as “combined reporting” that they claim would move more than $2 billion into state coffers.
The call came as the House and Senate worked toward a major sales tax cut for Floridians this session, although they remain far apart in terms of the amount and how it would be distributed.
The Senate on Tuesday was poised to pass its $2.1 billion tax cut plan (SPB 7034), which features permanent elimination of taxes on most clothing and shoes priced $75 or less.
The measure also calls for the Office of Economic and Demographic Research to establish a plan to reduce and potentially eliminate property taxes for homesteaded property. The study would conclude later this year and, if legislators are persuaded by it, they would vote during next year’s legislative session to ask the voters to eliminate property taxes via the 2026 ballot.
That’s what Gov. Ron DeSantis began hyping earlier this year. But after House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month his plan to permanently reduce the sales tax from 6% to 5.25% with an estimated savings of approximately $5 billion, DeSantis said the Legislature should spend that money on a property tax cut this year, giving an estimated 5.1 million residents who have a homestead exemption on their property taxes a rebate averaging $1,000 in December.
But neither the House nor the Senate has responded to that proposal, and it isn’t going anywhere this year. DeSantis has blasted the House proposal, saying he’d rather give a tax cut to Floridians and not to “Canadian tourists,” alluding to the fact that a sales tax would affect everyone who spent on items in Florida, such as tourists (who contributed about 16% of the sales taxes collected in the 2021-2022 fiscal year).
Targeting corporations
Meanwhile, during a press conference held in the Capitol Rotunda, Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani and Jackson Oberlink with the group Florida For All called upon the Legislature to link whatever sales tax emerges this year with what is known as “combined reporting.”
Combined reporting is a tax accounting method that states can require multinational corporations to use when calculating how much they owe on their annual profits. It’s in place in 28 states.
“Our taxes should serve working families, not wealthy corporations,” said Oberlink, legislative director for Florida For All. “Right now in Florida, multinational corporations are treating our state like an all-you-can-eat buffet. Combined reporting would close the loopholes that let giant corporations shift profits to tax havens and dodge billions in taxes.”
Eskamani echoed Oberlink, and referenced a report issued Tuesday called “The Cost of Corporate Giveaways 2025: How Florida Lawmakers Are Letting Big Corporations Dodge Taxes and Making Working People Pay the Price.” The report claims that adopting that system of taxing corporations would result in up to $2.4 billion in new revenue for the state without having to raise tax rates.
Eskamani expressed concern about the House plan to cut $5 billion. She recognizes that sales taxes are regressive, she said, but worries about how  the state will make up that lost revenue.
“We have a federal government which is slashing programs left and right, with very little due diligence or oversight,” Eskamani  said. 
“For a state like ours, which is very reliant on federal funding, we need to be cautious and careful about permanently cutting opportunities to generate revenue for essential services like Medicaid. Like public education. Like paying our public safety officials, and so forth. And so the solution that I have been mentioned many times as the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee is combined reporting.”
Eskamani emphasized that supporting combined reporting is not a partisan issue. In fact, former St. Cloud Republican House members Fred Hawkins filed legislation in 2021 to mandate multistate and multinational companies to file single Florida corporate income tax return covering their entire businesses, rather than separate returns for subsidiaries.
If all states that levy a corporate income tax adopted combined reporting, that policy would raise $18.7 billion a year, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

While veterans are already granted an employment preference under current state law, House Bill 114 would:

Remove the requirements that service be related to a period of war.
Include people serving on active duty.
Include members of the U.S. Armed Forces Reserve.
Include the spouse or dependent of a qualified person.

  Rep. Charles Smith (Photo: NC General Assembly)
“It [HB 114] addresses an employment preference statute that’s a little bit antiquated,” said Rep. Charles Smith (R-Cumberland), one of the bill’s co-sponsors.
Under current law, for example, veterans must have served during a period when the nation was at war. Current law defines the Vietnam War as the nation’s last such conflict.
“Time has passed and so to expand that preference to a greater pool of veterans, it strips away that language [defining the Vietnam War as the nation’s last],” Smith said.
Expanding eligibility for state job preferences could help fill vacancies in state government, Smith said.
In March, NC Newsline reported that the state’s job vacancy rate was 20%. The turnover rate was 12%, but significantly higher within an employee’s first year — 31%. Key sectors have especially high vacancy rates: 33% for health care, and 26% for corrections.
Smith said the changes in the law — particularly a provision extending the preference to spouses — would help North Carolina keep former military personnel in the state once they leave the service.
“As we strive to be a military friendly state, if we want to retain service members as they transition into civilian life, I think having a spouse with a career in state government is a good way to do that,” Smith said.
The veteran unemployment rate was 3.7% in March, which was down from 4.0% the previous month and up from 3.0% the prior year. Meanwhile, the civilian unemployment rate was 4.2%, which marked a slight increase over the 4.1% rate in February.
HB 114 comes amid uncertainty in federal employment as the Trump administration slashes jobs as part of its efforts to streamline the federal government. According to the Pew Research Center, more than 700,000 veterans worked in federal departments and agencies as of September 2024.
The Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank, reported in March that the Trump administration’s federal workforce cuts may jeopardize the careers of nearly 900,000 veterans, spouses of veterans and spouses of active military personnel. They makeup 30% of the entire federal government workforce. The federal government also gives hiring preferences to veterans. Veterans comprise just 5% of all employed Americans.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care for millions of veterans, is planning to cut 83,000 jobs.
In North Carolina, there are 84,900 civilian federal employees, according to EPI. Nearly 28,000 of them are veterans. Meanwhile, 33,200 are spouses of veterans or spouse of active-duty military service members. A quarter of the VA’s 482,000 employees are veterans.

Laura Kelly a state sales tax incentive bill to lure investment in gigantic data centers costing a minimum of $250 million.,"Wichita Republican Rep. Leo Delperdang, right, helped convince the Kansas House to overwhelmingly vote for Senate Bill 98 extending sales tax exemptions for construction, equipment and operation of large-scale data centers in Kansas. The projects can cost billions of dollars each. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature completed a fitful process of writing and rewriting a bill delivering a state tax subsidy to investors betting on construction of enormous data centers costing a minimum $250 million.
The House and Senate voted with bipartisan majorities on the final day of the 2025 session to send Gov. Laura Kelly a bill containing the sales tax incentive to help attract warehouse-shaped hubs packed with computer servers relied upon in the digital economy. The governor has 10 days to act on Senate Bill 98 once it lands on her desk.
Negotiators tossed an earlier Senate-passed version of the bill in a dumpster before approving an alternative limiting the length and scope of the sales tax break, setting boundaries on how huge quantities of electricity could be sourced and encouraging owners of data centers to conserve water used to cool the systems.
Modifications to the bill reflected anxiety about data centers hogging the electric grid or sucking up scarce water resources and leaving residential customers to pay the cost of replenishing those necessities.
“This bill affects everybody and we want to make sure we do the right thing,” said Rep. Leo Delperdang, a Wichita Republican who urged the House to approve the package.
He said a key piece of the puzzle was a prohibition in the bill forbidding owners of data centers to construct their own electric power plants. In addition, he said, the bill blocked data centers from taking advantage of a state law allowing big economic development projects to receive from a local utility company a 40% electricity rate reduction for five years and a subsequent 20% rate discount for the next five years.
On Friday, the House vote was 85-37. The Senate approved the bill 26-9 without substantive debate.
“Not only will it affect everybody, it’s going to affect the next generation and the next generation,” said Rep. Henry Helgerson, a Democrat from Eastborough who voted “no” while expressing concern about future water shortages. “I hate to be the spoiler in all this. There is no requirement of whether they’re going to save any water. People are being told right now not to plant trees, not to put bushes in.”
Helgerson also said it wasn’t appropriate for legislative leadership to force votes on the final day of the legislative session on a 100-page bill subjected to months of behind-the-scene wrangling.
The urgency made sense only in the context of pleasing those who would financially benefit the most from construction of facilities capable of centralizing storage, management and dissemination of data, he said.
“Who’s pushing all this? My guess it’s the investment bankers outside this state. They have billions of dollars they want to bring in,” he said.
 
‘Substantially different’
Under the overhauled SB 98 — formerly the data center reforms were in Senate Bill 51 — the state would authorize a 20-year sales tax exemption for companies investing in data centers costing at least $250 million. The exemption would cover purchases for development, acquisition and operation of a data center, including land and site improvements, buildings and data center equipment; labor services to install and maintain data center equipment; purchases by a contractor to build or modify a data center; and backup generators. It would exclude electric generation equipment.
The bill would define equipment in a data center to include servers, routers and connections and security systems; hardware to operate and equip a data center, including cooling and water management systems; computer networking equipment, including racks and cabling; and conduit and cabling to link one or more data centers substations.
The Kansas Fusion Center Oversight Board would be authorized to deny projects deemed a threat to state infrastructure, but the Kansas Department of Commerce would otherwise handle certification of applicants for the tax break. A qualified business would have to begin construction within 10 years of being approved by the state and must make the aggregate investment of $250 million within five years of starting operations.
In addition to construction jobs, the data center would be required to create and maintain at least 20 new jobs within two years of launching operations.
A telecommunications, wireless and video service provider wouldn’t be eligible to become a qualified firm to receive a state sales tax exemption for data centers. Countries of concern, including China, would be excluded from providing equipment to Kansas data centers that drew upon the sales tax break.
The data center would for 10 years be required to purchase electricity from the public utility providing the area’s retail electric service. If the Department of Commerce concluded a data center was in breach of the agreement, the firm would have 120 days to address the problem. If not, the agency could require the firm to repay all or part of the sales tax exemption and wholly or partially terminate the exemption.
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Hesston Republican who led Senate negotiations on the bill, said adjustments to the original bill demanded by the House improved the legislation.
“It is substantially different with additional guardrails than what passed the Senate,” Owens said. “I believe that actually makes this a better bill.”
 
Hail ‘hyperscale’ centers
The original data center bill, know as SB 51, was introduced in January by a representative of NetChoice, a trade association representing online businesses such as Meta, Apple, Amazon, Google and X. NetChoice has been involved in legal challenges to state regulations the organization believed infringed on free speech or free enterprise.
An early version of the bill was more generous in terms of delivering a sales tax exemption for 15 years on investments of $250 million, 30 years for investments of $500 million and 60 years on investments of $1 billion.
The economic development incentive for data centers was opposed by Americans for Prosperity of Kansas and the Kansas Sierra Club.
During a Senate committee hearing, the bill was endorsed by NetChoice, Geiger Ready-Mix, Evergy, Kansas Power Alliance, De Soto Chamber of Commerce, Diode Ventures, Kansas Electric Cooperatives, KC Tech Council and Wyandotte Economic Development Council.
“Data centers are the infrastructure for state-of-the-art search engines, cloud computing, web-based services and artificial intelligence,” said Brad Smooth, who lobbied for the tax break on behalf of NetChoice. “Hyperscale data centers are not being built in states that impose a sales tax on their construction, equipment, repair and operation. If Kansas wants to benefit from the billions in private dollars that go into data center construction and operations, it will need to create a tax structure that is competitive.”
A company called Red Wolf recently filed plans in Wyandotte County to build a 400-acre data center west of Kansas Speedway. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City said the project could total 1.8 million square feet of building space. One estimate indicated the total project investment could reach $12 billion.
Greg Kindle, president of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council, said the county had actively sought to attract data center development projects that would benefit from a state sales tax exemption.
“We have pursued data centers over the years, but were unsuccessful in large part due to sales taxes on the ongoing investments made by these facilities,” he said. “Kansas’ central and safe U.S. location is beneficial to attracting mega-investments of this scale.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Penn-and-Delperdang-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-15 15:10:31.107981

Credit Keith SchubertAdmonishing the Montana Legislature for being the “enabler” of a “pampered” and “dysfunctional” health department, Rep. John Fitzpatrick said Monday it’s time to break up the largest bureaucracy in the state.
The Republican from Anaconda said legislators have been forking over tens of millions of dollars to the Department of Public Health and Human Services and excusing it from accountability, and it’s time for a structural change.
“The problem with DPHHS is it’s too big, it’s inefficient, and the service quality declines,” Fitzpatrick said.
Fitzpatrick made his remarks in support of House Bill 851, which he said would transfer administration of state healthcare institutions and community-based programs to a new department of health services.
But his arguments didn’t fly with the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Safety Committee, which unanimously tabled his bill the same day.
The health department has experienced major and high-profile challenges, most notably the Montana State Hospital’s loss of federal funds and decertification by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2022.
However, during the hearing, members of the health community said the department is making progress, and a change would disrupt that trajectory.
Douglas Harrington, state medical officer, said in testimony regarding the confirmation of the health department director, Charlie Brereton, nearly 50 different groups expressed support not only for the director but for the path on which he has set the agency.
Additionally, Harrington said all seven health department facilities have stable leadership.
For the first time in years, nursing vacancies have been reduced by 30%, and the agency is recruiting roughly one new nurse a week, he said. Except for one-on-one visits, he said patient costs are down 25%.
“The bill is highly problematic for us at a time when significant momentum has been achieved,” Harrington said.
The health department annual plan for the current fiscal year — which ends June 30 — said the agency aims to implement 100% of required CMS recertification reforms at the state hospital in Warm Springs.
DPHHS did not respond to a question about whether the hospital will reach that goal this year.
Echoing the comments from many opponents of the bill, Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, said the idea to split the agency is so massive, it would need to be studied first.
Additionally, Glimm said, the state is starting to see positive results.
“Frankly, I think if you rip it in two right now, I think that starts to tear apart some of the effect of what we have going on there,” Glimm said.
Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, said he agreed.
Emrich said the bill wasn’t fully baked, essentially directing the governor to issue executive orders to finish it, and he moved to table it, which the committee supported on an 11-0 vote.
Even if legislators resurrect the bill, it may meet a hurdle in the Governor’s Office.
At a press conference last week, Gov. Greg Gianforte said he would not comment on the specific bill, but he said generally, his administration is opposed to bigger government.
He said splitting up an agency means two separate executive teams and potential silos that would make government less efficient.
“Those are principles that matter to our administration,” Gianforte said.
The House had supported the bill on an 82-15 vote, and Fitzpatrick was unrelenting in his criticism of the agency in committee. He said the state hospital is not in his district, but it’s close, and he gets frequent complaints about it.
Fitzpatrick also said the health department has spent profligately because it has failed to properly recruit, and legislators have been complicit in “shoveling the public’s money out like water going over the dam.”
“DPHHS has burned through $71 million to pay for traveling health care staff,” Fitzpatrick said. “That’s $97,000 a day.”
Most of the people who testified, though, said the bill would have negative consequences for the people the department is serving, although some said they appreciated the sponsor’s hunt for efficiencies and his care for Montanans.
Kali Wicks, with national mental health advocacy organization Inseparable, thanked Fitzpatrick for his interest in the topic, but said the bill had the potential to stop progress “in its tracks” and “create some issues with continuity of care.”
Wicks agreed it might be time for a study bill if time allowed.
Mike Chavers, representing the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch and the Behavioral Health Alliance of Montana, said change is hard, and progress in public systems can feel “painfully slow,” but HB 851 would derail momentum.
“We must oppose this bill, not because we’re resistant to reform, but because we started to see the fruits of our hard work,” Chavers said.
The agency’s chief legal counsel, Paula Stannard, said the bill could raise a “significant legal issue” depending on the way Montana broke up the department.
Stannard said federal rules require a single state agency to administer the state Medicaid plan, and a split could risk federal funds if it created separate points of contact.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_1879-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-04-15 14:10:38.631535

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As some Mainers finalized their taxes on Tuesday, roughly 75 used the filing deadline to protest what they view as state and federal tax structures that favor the rich — and more broadly, the Trump administration’s cuts to programs relied on by average Mainers that they see as footing the bill. 
As Auburn resident Nelson Beaudoin told Maine Morning Star, there are a hundred reasons that drew him to the rally, “and they all start with the letter T.” 
Advocates for tax reform under the coalition Mainers for Tax Fairness gathered at the State House in Augusta to voice their objections to Congress advancing a budget plan that lays the groundwork for extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. 
“We are here to connect the dots,” said Ryan Tipping, director of campaigns and strategy for the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy. “We need to listen to what the cost of that greed is.”
Tipping and other speakers pointed to a litany of cuts that have impacted Maine, including the Trump administration firing the entire staff of the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, which tens of thousands of Mainers rely on, and layoff notices issued to 13 employees of the Maine State Library last week, which also led to a temporary closure. 
They also cautioned about possible implications should the congressional budget plan pass, such as cuts to low-income food assistance and Medicaid, as many say the tax cuts in the plan will not be possible without slashing the program. 
“Is my life worth less than tax breaks for billionaires?” asked Gina Morin, a Mainer who relies on Medicaid for prescriptions to treat a chronic disease. 
Formed in 2020 and launched in 2021, the Mainers for Tax Fairness coalition comprises a number of organizations representing progressive interests across the state, such as Maine Equal Justice, Maine People’s Alliance and the Maine Center for Economic Policy, who are also backing bills being considered by the Maine Legislature to restructure the state’s tax brackets.
“If the rich paid more taxes, they would still be rich,” Sharon Beaudoin, a retired educator from Auburn who attended the rally, told Maine Morning Star.

Last week, the Taxation Committee tabled a number of the tax reform bills that the group supports to wait until a nonpartisan state committee releases its updated state revenue projections next month. The state is currently looking at a projected deficit of $450 million over the next two years. 
In order to fill the gap, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has proposed some program cuts and a number of largely regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on low earners, but the coalition is alternatively pushing for a model that taxes the wealthy more.
Among those bills is LD 1089, sponsored by Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell), which would impose an income tax surcharge of 4% on taxable income in excess of $1 million, with the revenue generated going to fund public K-12 education. 
That $1 million level triggers the 4% surcharge for all tax filing statuses, which is not typical for tax structures in Maine. Therefore, the committee is considering an amendment, which in addition to some technical tweaks would add another level before the 4% surcharge would be triggered. 
Another bill, LD 229 sponsored by Rep. Ann Matlack (D-Spruce Head), would add new tax brackets and increase the threshold for the state’s lower tax brackets.
Other bills that the tax rally attendees highlighted include a plan to impose an additional tax of 4% on investment income above certain thresholds and another to increase the real estate transfer tax for sales over $1 million.
The coalition also supports legislation that aims to support the average Mainer in other ways, including by expanding the state’s version of a child tax credit and increasing funding for family planning services, such routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, but not abortions. 
Anna Kellar, executive director of Maine Citizens for Clean Elections, discussed bills that, in light of the budget outlook, lawmakers seem poised to reject that aim to expand the state’s clean elections program, which finances campaigns through public funding.
“Unfortunately, when we’re in tight budget years like this, funding for clean elections gets pitted against funding for all of the other things that we care about — rental assistance, Medicaid, our schools,” Kellar said. “But we refuse to accept this idea of scarcity.”
Instead, Kellar said the solution is clear: “making the wealthy pay their fair share.” 
The rally on Tax Day was also the first stop for the inflatable “tax the ultra rich” yacht tour, said Lewiston-Auburn resident Rebecca Swanson Conrad, who represents Oxfam “Sisters on the Planet,”  a group working to end global economic injustice. 
“I simply do not believe that a billionaire’s yacht should come at the expense of everyday Americans,” Swanson Conrad said, to which members of the crowd responded, “damn right.”
However, she added that the work ahead is not convincing those in attendance today but rather, she said, “those who cannot see how it impacts them, yet.”
Swanson Conrad urged people to share the stories told today with neighbors and call on them to press their elected officials to push back on tax cuts for the wealthy, before the group walked to the federal offices of Maine’s U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Angus King, an independent, to begin those calls.

Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young, himself a former Democratic state lawmaker, has held the office since 2019. All four of Colorado’s executive-branch posts — governor, attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer — are currently held by Democrats who are term-limited and will be up for grabs in 2026.
Other candidates who are running in the Democratic primary for treasurer include Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone; Jerry DiTullio, the Jefferson County treasurer; and John Mikos. No Republicans so far have filed candidacy paperwork with the state.
Bridges touted his sponsorship of a successful bill to provide full-day kindergarten to Colorado children, his pandemic-era bills for small business relief, and his support for the state’s comprehensive paid sick leave policy. 
Bridges is endorsed by former Ambassador Ken Salazar, state Senate President James Coleman, and former state Senate President Steve Fenberg, among other Colorado Democrats, according to a press release.

(Courtesy of Dr. Priya Bansal)Patients in five states who have severe asthma and are covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield are facing a new obstacle to getting treatment.
On Tuesday, BCBS began mandating that severe asthma patients self-administer their drugs at home, unless their provider gets prior approval from the insurance company.
The patients affected are those covered in Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana, but not those with Medicare or Medicaid, the insurance giant says.
Given as injections, the treatments in question are Fasenra (benralizumab), Tezspire (tezepelumab), Nucala (mepolizumab) and Xolair (omalizumab). All belong to a class of drugs known as biologics.
The decision is expected to affect thousands of patients. It’s estimated that between 5% and 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, characterized by more flare-ups and hospitalizations. In Illinois, for example, about 860,000 patients have asthma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means between 43,000 and 86,000 of them have severe asthma.
Clinics already have loads of prior authorizations to process that often delay care, said Dr. Priya Bansal, a pediatrician and asthma and allergy physician in Illinois. Her practice sees many rural patients and those with chronic disease.
“On any given day, we’ll have anywhere from 30, to my highest was 130,” she said.
The change interferes with a provider and patient decision on whether in-office or at-home treatment is best for the patient, Bansal said.
“That decision that’s supposed to go on between the physician and the patient is getting taken away,” she said. “If I have a pediatric food allergy patient and they want to get the medication in the clinic, I want to be able to have the flexibility to do that.”
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

The sickest asthma patients are often on biologics, explained Dr. Bridgette Jones, past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ drug committee and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology’s asthma cough diagnosis and treatment panel.
“These are the patients that have failed at other therapies,” said Jones, a pediatric allergy and immunology physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Missouri. “Once you’re getting to a biologic, it means that your asthma is not under control, having frequent flare-ups.”
Black and Indigenous adults and children, as well as Puerto Rican people have higher rates of illness and less access to care.
For people who suffer from severe asthma, the typical inhaler is often not enough. The affected drugs can help manage severe, uncontrolled asthma by reducing airway inflammation,
While the drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for self-injecting at home, they also come with risks for the uncommon but life-threatening anaphylaxis.
That’s why providers typically start patients on these drugs in-office for monitoring.
But for at least one of the drugs, Xolair, the reaction can also happen up to a year into treatment.
Many families are not comfortable administering biologics to their kids with severe asthma, Jones said.
Clinics serving higher-need or underserved populations may often lack the resources to deal with more prior approvals, she added.
A recent study by Massachusetts General Hospital and funded by Amgen, which developed Tezspire with AstraZeneca, suggested that in some states, the percentage of asthma patients with severe asthma is higher than 10%. In Texas, for example, about 23% of severe persistent asthma had severe uncontrolled disease.

Mike Braun on Tuesday to kick off a “Make Indiana Healthy Again” initiative featuring nine freshly inked executive orders.

He spoke atop a dais before dozens of dignitaries and others packed into in an ornate, wood-paneled room at the Indiana State Library. Just outside a pair of large wooden doors, protesters waved signs and chanted, their calls audible.
“This isn’t a usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda. We’re focused on root causes, transparent information and real results,” Braun added.
His orders deal with government food and health assistance, food additives, student fitness and more — and make Indiana the latest state to promote Trump’s push to “Make America Healthy Again.”
One order would impose work requirements on Hoosiers who receive assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and another “removes candy and soft drinks from SNAP benefits so that taxpayer funds are helping low income Americans afford nutritious food, not junk.”
Oz dubbed Tuesday “a monumental day, not just in Indiana, but for this great nation,” noting Indiana’s nine orders exceed actions by other states.
“It turns out that about the most patriotic thing you can do these days is to get healthy,” Oz added later.

For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.

‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.

CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.

Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Photo by John Cole/Capital-Star)Brent Copenhaver and his wife Stacey own Talview Dairy Farm, a dairy operation in Lebanon County, and sell most of their milk regionally in Pennsylvania.
To Brent, he thinks there is currently one big issue farmers across Pennsylvania are thinking about.
“I think tariffs definitely are on people’s mind,” Brent Copenhaver said to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star. “How that will impact us locally is still, I think, yet to be determined.”
The Copenhavers hosted several high-ranking government officials on Monday morning, including U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. She was joined by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson – Chair of the House Agriculture Committee –and U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-9th District.
They made the case the tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration will prove beneficial to farmers.
Rollins, during the first of three stops in central Pennsylvania, said Trump’s tariffs on foreign products was a move to “save America.”

Since Trump made his tariff announcement on April 2, the stock market has experienced volatility, leading to concerns from economists about a potential recession.
Rollins said the effort was to create better trade deals with countries, who she claimed have been taking advantage of America for decades.
“That realignment is disruptive. It’s transformative, but is disruptive,” Rollins said. “And so we’re watching the market adjust to that right now. We believe it will be a short-term adjustment.”
McCormick, who supports Trump’s tariff policy, said there has been “uncertainty” with the markets as of late, but he believes that the economy will benefit as new trade deals are ironed out.
During Trump’s first term, some $25 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was used to give direct payments to farmers impacted by trade disputes with China. Rollins said the administration is prepared to provide relief to farmers “if there is damaging consequences to these (trade) negotiations.”
“The hope and the goal is that it won’t be necessary,” Rollins said, but added the administration was prepared to help out farmers, if needed.
Thompson echoed Rollins, saying he was “fully supportive of Trump” on the issue of trade and that he doesn’t expect it will be needed for farmers, but is prepared to support those payments, if needed.
Thompson referenced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and China Phase One deal, during Trump’s administration as proof he trusts the president on resolving the ongoing tariff situation.
Rollins says ‘money is there for food banks’
In March, the USDA notified Pennsylvania and other states across the country that it was canceling programs to provide $1 billion of federal funding to schools and food banks to allow them to purchase food from farms, according to Politico.
Following the move, Gov. Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Agriculture Sec. Russell Redding held a press conference on March 25 announcing they were pushing back on the USDA action to cancel $13 million over the next three years in funding for Pennsylvania farmers. Redding said he sent a letter to the federal agency to appeal the decision and Shapiro said if it fails, he would consider further legal action.
Rollins said she respects Shapiro, but added he or other leaders in Pennsylvania, “don’t have their facts right, or they’re playing games.”
“They’re trying to make this a political issue,” Rollins said to reporters at Martin’s Family Farm in Myerstown, Lebanon County. “The money is there.”
Rollins argued since becoming the head of the USDA, they’ve “released almost one billion dollars to food banks” and said there is money sitting in state accounts from the USDA to support food banks.
Thompson says no cuts will be made to SNAP
A budget plan from House Republicans would cut $230 billion from the Department of Agriculture, according to Reuters, and Democrats are concerned the cuts would come from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. It “provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget.
Thompson called it a “mistruth” and said that he is “not going to stand for any cuts” to the program.
“These are our neighbors that are living in difficult financial times,” Thompson said. He added that changes can be made to make the program more effective.
During a Q&A with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star in March, Thompson said there would be no reductions to SNAP in the next Farm Bill and would like to expand access to “two vulnerable populations who have never been eligible” for SNAP before: Those previously incarcerated for felony drug charges when they return from prison and “adult children of families that are living in financially challenging circumstances,” who “tend to be children with disabilities.”
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cited potential cuts to SNAP as reasons he’s opposed recent GOP budget plans.

‘Labor is a massive concern,’ Rollins says
As the Trump administration follows through on its promise of deportations, the president suggested at a cabinet meeting Thursday that farmers could petition to keep workers without legal status, Reuters reported. Rollins recognized the concern the administration has over the agriculture workforce on Monday.
“Labor continues to be a massive concern for our agriculture community,” Rollins said.
The secretary said she and U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer have been tasked with working with legislative partners to come up with solutions to the issue.
Thompson said in the previous session of Congress, he put together a bipartisan work group to address the challenges facing the agriculture workforce and “in the not too distant future” they will put together a “discussion draft” to get input on potential remedies.
“We need to do this in a tri-partisan way,” Thompson said, making the case that Democrats, Republicans, and the agriculture industry can work together on the matter.
In the past, Thompson said the H2-A visa program, which helps American farmers fill temporary employment gaps by hiring workers from other countries, needs to be reformed, including making it “year round.”

How’s the Farm Bill?
Thompson said the Farm Bill, which is passed roughly every five years, is “coming along nicely.”
In 2024, Congress approved a one-year extension of the bill, as the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are on the clock to pass the next version of the legislation.
Will it pass this year?
“You bet,” Thompson said. “It absolutely should. The sooner in the year is the better, obviously.”
Thompson previously told the Capital-Star his goal was to “get this done in the first six months and as early as possible.”
With elected leaders and Secretary Rollins on hand, Brent Copenhaver said he was “honored” to host them and “promote the dairy industry.” He described updating the Farm Bill as important to local farmers as well and specifically wanting to see updated language for dairy margin coverage.
“Those numbers are based off your production history, and those numbers are outdated,” he said. “We have improved on how we have handled our cows. We have improved our milk production, and I think they need to go back and revisit and look at that production history and allow us to increase that production history to be on a more average of what we are doing today.”
“We just need to update some of the things. It’s already in the bill. We just need it updated,” Copenhaver added. “And it’s a great program that the USDA does offer.”

The debate over House Bill 1163 has been one of the most contentious this legislative session. 
Conservatives and gun owners think it puts an unconstitutional barrier to the right to bear arms. 
Democrats see it as one more step the state can take to reduce gun violence, after banning bump stocks and prohibiting sales of high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic firearms.
“As the son and grandson and nephew and cousin of responsible gun owners, I know that the Second Amendment is critical to our freedom that’s cherished by Washingtonians around the state,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in floor debate Monday, “but I know that gun owners across Washington are united in their desire to make sure that only those who are legally authorized to have firearms should have access to them.” 
The bill moves beyond the state’s existing background check system. 
It would require gun buyers to apply for a five-year permit from the Washington State Patrol. To qualify, applicants must have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with some exceptions, and pay a fee.
If the applicant has completed the safety course, the state would have to approve the permit unless the person is barred from having guns, out of custody on bond awaiting trial or sentencing on felony charges, or the subject of an arrest warrant. 
Troopers would issue the permit within 30 days, or 60 days if the applicant doesn’t have a state ID. State patrol anticipates receiving at least 100,000 applications per year, with over 40 employees tasked with handling them.
The agency expects the new program will cost nearly $20 million in the 2027-29 budget cycle. Fees collected for fingerprinting and background checks would offset the cost, according to a fiscal analysis. The system could bring in $31 million in the 2027-29 budget.
Democrats in the Senate passed the legislation on a party-line 29-19 vote. 
Amendments made in the Senate include exemptions from the training requirement for licensed armed security guards and private investigators. Lawmakers also delayed the effective date from November 2026 to May 2027.
On Monday, Democratic senators shot down Republican amendments to exempt some groups from the permit requirement, among other things.
The bill, which has the support of state Attorney General Nick Brown, now returns to the House for lawmakers there to consider the changes before sending it to the governor. 
The policy has never come this close to becoming law. Last year, it didn’t even advance out of committee.
About a dozen states have implemented permit-to-purchase programs, and such laws have withstood legal challenges.
Still, Republicans in the Legislature believe courts would strike down the Washington proposal. Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, called the bill “hostile to the Second Amendment.”
“This is simply a poorly designed assault on hard-working taxpayers who want to legally exercise their hunting rights, their Second Amendment rights,” said Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville.
Most other Democratic priorities on guns have fizzled out this year in Olympia, including proposals to limit bulk purchases of firearms and ammunition, require gun owners to lock up their weapons in their cars and homes and add new requirements for gun dealers.
But a bill expanding the list of places where it’s illegal to carry a gun has cleared the Senate and now awaits a vote in the House.

(Screengrab from NCGA video stream)As the North Carolina Senate fast tracks a newly released two-year budget proposal through the chamber this week, members of the state’s Progressive House Caucus held a press conference Tuesday to call out what they say is the lack of public input and accountability in the budgeting process.
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said the Senate budget that earmarks $32.6 billion in 2025-26 and $33.3 billion the year after was crafted with no collaboration from Democrats or real public input.
“[Billion of dollars] are rolled into a last-minute conference report, dumped on our desk, and shoved through with an up or down vote. That is not just a procedural complaint. It’s a democratic crisis,” said Butler at a Tuesday legislative press conference.
Butler is advocating for two bills she sponsored earlier in the session to improve the budget process.
House Bill 178, the “Budgeting Accountability and Transparency Act,” would require that any conference committee report (the document that spells out the final version of a bill that has been agreed to by House and Senate leaders) on the budget be publicly available for at least 72 hours before a vote can occur. It would give lawmakers, stakeholders and the public time to read the hundreds of pages that make up the budget bill.
House Bill 180, “Fiscally Responsible & Sustainable Budgeting,” would require a multi-year look back and look forward based on performance rather than relying on one-time money. HB 180 also requires that any tax cut or spending increase over a certain threshold include an offset so future legislatures are not saddled with obligations the state cannot afford.
“These bills do not favor Democrats or Republicans. They favor the people of North Carolina who deserve to see how their money is being spent,” said Butler.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said legislative leaders would also be wise to embrace House Bill 303 (“Make Corporations Pay What They Owe”) that would halt the ongoing gradual repeal of the corporate income tax.
“We don’t need to cut the corporate income tax to zero by 2030. This state will lose $2 billion that can be used for our priorities of helping people, helping school children, the necessities we need to make the state stronger,” Morey urged. “It must be reinstated so this state can be fiscally responsible.”
Alexandra Sirota of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center cautioned that North Carolina is experiencing the ripple effects of federal funding chaos, program freezes, and a looming congressional budget that threatens to push even more costs onto the states.
“Unless our legislative leaders change course, we know that North Carolina’s future budget picture will get worse, not better. We cannot afford to trust empty promises,” Sirota warned.
 State workers, Helene survivors, faith leaders call for public investments 
Charles Owens, a healthcare technician at Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro, said that with rising housing costs and living expenses, state workers deserve better than the meager increases being put forth in the budget proposal unveiled by Senate leaders Monday night.
“The workers at Cherry Hospital, along with all the other DHHS facilities, work with the most vulnerable, exploited, and sometimes the most dangerous people in North Carolina, meaning the mentally ill, the abused, and sometimes criminals shipped to us from the prisons,” Owens explained. “We take care of them with some of the best treatment this state can offer. But yet, as public workers, we aren’t being taken care of by our lawmakers.”
Most state workers would see a 1.25% raise next year, as well as a $3,000 bonus over the next two years in the Senate proposal.
Owens said that as budget writers advance another round of corporate tax cuts, state employees are being told to expect to pay higher costs for participating in the State Health Plan next year.
“Imagine public workers that provide health care, being told that the state can afford tax cuts, but they can’t afford to continue making investments in our health.”
  Sam Stites, Just Economics (Courtesy photo)
Sam Stites, the living wage program coordinator with the group Just Economics, traveled to Raleigh from Transylvania County on Tuesday to urge lawmakers to craft a better budget.
Stites said for western North Carolina it’s been a year of rude awakenings since Helene, with relief dollars slow to materialize for many working-class individuals.
“Wealthy individuals and corporations should not be getting tax cuts when working western North Carolinians are being evicted and small businesses are shuttering. That is why I came here.”
Stites said in addition to rebuilding infrastructure, lawmakers need to help the hundreds of Helene survivors who are facing eviction.
“I’m talking about the $10 million you were asked for in rental assistance and said ‘no’ to, and the small business grants that you were asked for and aid ‘No’ to,” said Stites. “To me it is simple, if you do not have enough money for working people and small businesses, then you do not have enough money for tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations.”
  Abby Lublin, Carolina Jews for Justice (Courtesy photo)
Abby Lublin, executive director of Carolina Jews for Justice, said the state budget is truly a statement about North Carolina’s values.
“Cutting the corporate income tax does not fill a child’s stomach. It doesn’t raise teacher pay. It doesn’t heal our rural hospitals or fix our crumbling roads.”
Lublin said simply pausing the corporate tax rate at its current level would provide revenue for services that are desperately needed at a time of sweeping federal cuts.
“To the lawmakers who are enacting a budget process without transparency, I’m looking right at you,” said Lublin. “A budget that pits people and communities against each other to fight for crumbs is only due to a lack of moral courage.”

Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, introduces the budget on third reading before the Senate on April 15, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The state’s two-year budget cleared a hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, securing bipartisan support to move forward through the legislative process. 
The portion of the budget under House Bill 1001 dedicated to funding the state’s share of Medicaid expenses continues to grow, increasing from from 15% in 2021 to 18% in 2023 and 22% in this year’s budget. 
“For the last couple of years, I’ve been very concerned about Medicaid,” said Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “I hope you’re all starting to see that as well.”
Mishler helms budget-writing in the Senate.
Aside from Medicaid and K-12 education, two state agencies absorbed nearly all of the increased spending: the Department of Child Services and the Department of Correction. The former overspent its last appropriation while the latter ran out of dollars to pay the per diem for local jails to house low-level felony offenders. 
The Republican-led budget won the vote of Sen. David Niezgodski, a Democrat from South Bend. He pointed to funding for commuter rail in his district along with “settling the lease with the (Indiana) Historical Society,” an agreement that was in doubt following some language appearing to contradict Republican intentions. 
Republicans reject cascade of Democratic amendments to budget

Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, also broke his streak of opposing the budget to support House Bill 1001 on Tuesday. The sole Republican to vote against the measure, Indianapolis Sen. Mike Young, didn’t explain his vote. 
But not everyone was on board, despite the bipartisan support. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura criticized the lack of funds dedicated to shrinking the state’s outstanding waitlists for Medicaid waiver services as well as inadequate funding for curricular materials for local school corporations.
“The question is not whether or not Indiana has the resources — it is the question about the priorities. Sen. Mishler and my colleagues are correct: Medicaid is growing and public education is growing,” said Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “Doesn’t it concern you that two million out of 6.9 million have to rely on some form of health care provided by the government? What does that tell you about the status … the futures across the state?”
One Republican also shared her concerns about the budget moving forward.
Sen. Vaneta Becker said that while she would support the proposal on Tuesday, she “likely wouldn’t” when it returned for a final vote. She cited public education funding concerns as well as the decision to strike funding for the Women’s Commission and the Indiana Commission on the Social Status of Black Males. 
“I’m very disappointed in the loss of those but the biggest thing I’m sorry about is the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. It’s such a small amount when you’re looking at a $44 billion budget. It was $2 million in the first year,” said Becker, R-Evansville. “… if you’re concerned about early childhood literacy, you can’t do better than that.”
She said she hoped First Lady Maureen Braun would be able to independently raise funds for the program, as she previously said she would do.
The proposal will go to a conference committee, which allows the two chambers to negotiate final language that reflects updated data due to be released during a Wednesday revenue forecast.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Legislation that could land animal abusers in prison for as long as ten years passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee late Monday after it appeared to die last week without a vote before the Legislature’s first deadline. 
“Amendments come and go and change at rapid speed as we approach the deadline,” the committee’s chairperson, Assemblywoman Brittany Miller said during Monday’s work session, indicating her internal polling of committee members last week, as amendments were crafted in the final hours, did not bode well for the measure. “At no time was there anyone who doesn’t want to address the heinous crimes and acts of animal cruelty.”
Miller said lawmakers “don’t always have time to process” amendments, adding the committee was able to obtain a waiver allowing the Assembly Judiciary to vote Assembly Bill 381 out of committee. The bill, Reba’s Law, was “able to be resurrected,” Miller said, resulting in a “much more intense, robust bill than we had before.” 
The measure is named for Reba, a bulldog who died of heat stroke days after she was found in a sealed tote behind a business last summer. 
An amendment from the Nevada District Attorneys Association eliminated provisions that would have allowed for the prosecution of individuals who allow the abuse of an animal. 
The amendment also removes language requiring permission from the animal’s owner or a veterinarian to euthanize an animal. It instead requires a peace officer to forfeit the animal to a local government if the owner does not request a hearing within a certain time frame, or cannot be found within five business days. The local government must then decide whether to euthanize the animal or transfer ownership to a rescue organization, shelter or individual. 
Causing the death of an animal would be deemed a category B felony, and could land offenders in prison for one to ten years and a fine of not more than $10,000. 
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson complained last year he needed stiffer penalties to impose against animal abusers than those allowed by law. However, a review of cases prosecuted by Wolfson indicates he rarely seeks prison time, even in egregious cases. 
Lynn Whatford, a Clark County resident who cared for community cats in her neighborhood, spent much of the last year seeking justice for a colony of two dozen cats she says disappeared one by one. She suspects her neighbor killed them.
Nevada Voters for Animals founder Gina Greisen told lawmakers that Wolfson declined to prosecute the case after Whatford discovered a trapped cat left in her neighbor’s yard without protection from the sun and a high temperature of 114 degrees on July 25, the day the cat likely died. A veterinarian’s post mortem examination noted “it is clear (the cat) experienced extreme physical suffering in an inescapable situation, and that heat stroke is the likely cause of death in this case.” 
Whatford complained to Clark County Animal Control for months that the cats were disappearing and that she heard cries coming from her neighbor’s yard. 
“Animal Control told me I needed proof, yet the officer couldn’t access my neighbor’s property to get the proof. Animal Control referred me to Metro, but the detective wouldn’t do anything until I had proof,” Whatford said during an interview in September.
Greisen testified in support of the measure, but warned that without proper training and resources for police and animal control officers, stricter penalties will do little to help stem abuse and neglect. 
Las Vegas justice activist Leslie Turner testified in opposition and said the measure is “just another way to funnel more people into the criminal legal system,” and does nothing to address the causes of cruelty, including “mental health struggles, childhood trauma, cycles of violence, economic instability.” 
A one to ten year sentence, she noted, exceeds the one to six year sentence for child abuse. “How can we justify punishing someone more harshly for harming an animal than for harming a child? What does this say about our priorities?” she asked in written testimony, adding lawmakers should instead invest in “education, early intervention, and community-based mental health resources.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BrittneyMiller-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-15 13:21:04.334779

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Democrat House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson announced she’ll run for governor in 2026 during a campaign event outside the state Capitol Tuesday. 
Munson, 39, of Oklahoma City, was first elected to the Oklahoma House in 2015 as the first Asian-American woman in the state Legislature. She said she will continue to serve in her role as House Minority Leader until her term ends in 2026. 
“I’m going to spend the next year-and-a-half traveling our beautiful state, listening to people and asking them what’s important to them,” she said. “I want to know what they love about Oklahoma and what they think we can do better, because that is what this campaign is about, the people of our great state, and that is what I will carry with me as your next governor.”
She filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Monday.
Munson is the only Democrat to announce a bid for governor during the 2026 election cycle thus far, but already faces opposition from a crowded Republican field that includes Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, former House Speaker Charles McCall, former state Sen. Mike Mazzei, and Leisa Mitchell Haynes of Choctaw. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, cannot run again due to term limits.
She said she was the first Democrat to flip her seat from Republican, and plans to use the same strategy of listening to Oklahomans regardless of their political affiliation in her campaign for governor.
“I know I’m not what you would call a typical candidate for governor. I work for a living, I pay my student loans, I rent my house, and I know what it is like to live within a budget,” she said. “I feel the pressure of rising costs of our daily necessities. I don’t come from a wealthy family. I’m not beholden to any political party. I’m not an extremist. I have a proven track record of working across the aisle to get things done and won’t pander to Washington D.C. politicians who only want to continue deepening our political divide. And as your next governor, I will fight for the things that will help everyday Oklahomans.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
There was a time George Finley Jr. was on the honor roll.
After the seventh grader started having epileptic seizures a couple of years ago, he experienced memory loss. Now, he’s far behind where he should be academically. The Detroit Public Schools Community District agreed in November to pay for outside tutoring to help him catch up, records show.
That still hasn’t happened, and the school year is near its end.
“My son is not progressing,” said his mother, Sheri King.
She was close to getting an answer from the district. But the Trump administration gutted the U.S. Department of Education’s workforce weeks later, and the civil rights attorney who was helping facilitate King’s communication with George’s school stopped responding to her emails. His position, along with hundreds of others, was eliminated. With new leadership, the department shuttered more than half of its regional civil rights enforcement offices, which had investigated and resolved complaints for decades. Now, remaining offices must take on the backlog of cases.
King is in the same position as many families in Michigan and across the country. Parents of students with disabilities and those who experience racial discrimination or sexual violence in schools are uncertain of the fate of their federal complaints. Many say they have not gotten updates on their cases since the regional offices closed. Some, like King, fear what the future will look like for their children.
Hundreds of federal civil rights cases were put on hold after President Donald Trump took office in January. On Feb. 20, Craig Trainor, now the deputy assistant secretary for policy in the Office for Civil Rights, ended the pause on cases that solely dealt with disability discrimination. Staff were still told not to pursue race- and sex-based discrimination cases. At the same time, under new guidance, targeted investigations of school programs that promote diversity and policies that support transgender students were initiated.
Education Secretary Linda McMahon lifted the freeze on all cases on March 6. However, the department laid off the staff of seven of its 12 civil rights enforcement offices on March 12. The closures included the Cleveland office, which handled cases for Michigan and Ohio.
Advocates said the move effectively decimated the department’s workforce and sabotaged its ability to enforce civil rights protections for students.
Former attorneys at the Department of Education said the nearly 50% reduction in staff will undoubtedly add to an existing backlog of cases.
“The reality is, cases aren’t moving, period,” one former Cleveland office staff attorney told Chalkbeat on the condition of anonymity due to fears of retribution.
The gutting of the department added to an existing backlog of thousands of open complaints. In Michigan alone, there are currently 782 civil rights cases under investigation, according to the department’s list of records published online. Of those, 462 are disability discrimination cases. Those investigations were opened before the dramatic changes to the department.
Michigan special education advocates said many of the parents they work with have not heard updates on their cases. Some had pending mediation hearing dates with their districts scheduled that have since passed.
Jacquelyn Binford, whose son, Rocco, is in first grade in Chippewa Valley Schools, was scheduled to have a mediation hearing on March 19 for a complaint she filed in December 2023. She hoped the district would agree to provide more occupational therapy to help her son develop his motor skills.
The district’s representative never responded to confirm the hearing date.
Since then, all of Michigan’s cases were assigned to the federal department’s Denver office. Binford said she hasn’t gotten any updates about the case.
“Here we are now,” Binford said. “This could have already been resolved.”
Chippewa Valley Schools did not respond to a request for comment on Binford’s case.
Detroit Public Schools Community District officials said they “respect the challenges that all parents with students” with individualized education programs, or IEPs, have.
The district said it will continue to “problem solve through the challenges they are facing to ensure their children succeed in school with the limited resources the District receives to educate each child with an IEP.”
 Critical services, safety at stake for children, workers say

The Office for Civil Rights is charged with investigating and enforcing federal protections for students in K-12 schools, as well colleges and universities. It also facilitates mediations to come to voluntary agreements between parties.
The department is mandated to promptly investigate and resolve complaints against local and state education agencies as an impartial third party.
The federal laws it seeks compliance with include Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which ensures students with disabilities have a right to equal access to educational opportunities and services.
Quickly resolving complaints is crucial to the safety and educational outcomes of many children, former federal workers say.
“There could be a kid staying at home because they’re the survivor of sexual assault and there are no measures in place to ensure their safety,” the former Cleveland staff member said. “Or there could be a student with a behavior plan that’s not being implemented and that student is being restrained.”
Before his departure, the attorney said there was a case close to mediation that involved a high school student in a juvenile detention facility. The complaint alleged the facility did not have the special education services that would allow the child to graduate.
“I did feel like there could be a pathway to see this kid graduate,” the attorney said. “We had to cancel mediation because we were told not to do any communication with schools.”
Because the department missed the opportunity to intervene before the end of the school year, the attorney said the window to help the student graduate is gone.
A large part of the work of attorneys at the Cleveland office fell outside of investigations and mediations to reach early resolutions, another former staff member told Chalkbeat.
In King’s case, a mediation agreement was already made. But, the mother told the attorney who was assigned to her original complaint that the district was not complying with the tutoring portion of the agreement.
The attorney was in the process of finding the point of contact in the district to finalize George’s enrollment and payment for the tutoring program before the Cleveland office was shuttered.
Binford said while she waits for an answer from Chippewa Valley Schools about whether they will provide in-school occupational therapy for Rocco, he struggles to keep up with his peers in gym class. He still needs help developing his muscles to open and close zippers, write, and cut food.
Michigan families are also awaiting the outcome of an Office for Civil Rights investigation that found the Michigan Department of Education allegedly violated the rights of students with disabilities during COVID-era school closures.
The state agency was accused of repeatedly giving incorrect information about students’ rights to parents and schools, according to legal filings. The federal investigation also alleged the state agency knew districts were failing to provide services to students with disabilities.
The federal investigation alleged students at the Michigan School for the Deaf, which is operated by the Michigan education agency, had their instructional time reduced by 43% during the 2020-21 school year. Students didn’t get speech language pathology, social work, or visual impairment consultation services for long periods of time, according to the federal agency.
The complaint seeks compensatory services for all students with disabilities in the state who were denied adequate educational support during that time.
Attorneys for the agency asked multiple times for the case to be thrown out. The Office for Civil Rights accused the state agency of attempting to shield itself from scrutiny and said in case filings it had not provided any proof that its alleged violations have been remedied.
Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate who filed the initial complaint against the state agency, said the administrative law judge assigned to the case was not impacted by the cuts to the Department of Education. She said a final hearing date for the administrative judge to issue a ruling has not yet been set.
“We’re still waiting every day to see what happens,” said Lipsitt.
The Michigan Department of Education has denied any wrongdoing.
 Caseloads have doubled since federal cuts, former staff say

The federal Department of Education handles thousands of cases each year. In 2024, it received nearly 23,000 complaints.
Now that 240 staff members at the Office for Civil Rights have been laid off, those who remain are saddled with more than double their usual caseloads, according to former Cleveland attorneys.
Staff working at the regional offices that are still open also will have to learn the idiosyncrasies of state-specific laws. The attorneys who were laid off took with them decades of institutional knowledge, according to former staff.
A federal lawsuit filed on March 13 against the Education Department, Trainor, and McMahon, alleges the agency’s “complaint and investigation processing functions have fallen under attack.”
Two parents and the nonprofit association Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, including two Michigan members, are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs allege the department “has abdicated its responsibility to enforce civil rights protections, leaving students who should be able to trust and rely on their government to protect and defend their rights to instead endure discriminatory and unsafe learning environments without recourse.”
The Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.
 Michigan families say they have run out of options

Many families feel they have run out of options after years of fighting for their children to receive appropriate education and support.
Lyn Hollister, mother of twins in ninth grade in Tri County Area Schools, filed federal complaints in February and still hasn’t heard anything about their statuses.
Shelbie, Hollister’s daughter who has autism and mild cognitive impairment, is still waiting for the district to modify her curriculum to focus on life and job skills. As she waits, Shelbie is suffering from mental health issues because of the stress to meet grade level standards.
Last week, the district agreed to put Hollister’s other daughter, Makenzie, who has cognitive impairment and severe cerebral palsy, on a track to receive a high school completion certificate instead of a diploma. The change will allow Makenzie to get more thorough transition services after high school, her mother said.
Hollister requested the same for Shelbie but is still fighting for the change.
“When your child comes home on certain days they have struggled and wrap their arms around you crying because they are so overwhelmed that day because of what is put on them, you just break down,” she said. “And your hands are tied.”
A representative for Tri County Area Schools declined to comment on Hollister’s case.
Hollister said she plans on moving her daughters to another school in the fall. They qualify for a Section 105c waiver, which will allow them to attend a school outside of their district.
“We’re hoping in this new district, they can finally have a team to support our children to be the best that they can be,” she said.
King, the Detroit mother, said if she could afford to, she would move to another part of the state in hopes of finding a district that might provide a better outcome for George.
Options like private school wouldn’t work for Rocco, said Binford.
“I worry he would be forgotten about,” she said. “They don’t have the resources or the training to support him in a private school. We really do rely on the public education system.”
In some cases, complaints filed with the federal department can be handled by state or local agencies. That depends on what protections states have covered in their own civil rights laws.
In Michigan, the state education agency’s Office of Special Education enforces compliance with parts of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and state law. The office investigates and mediates state-level complaints. Complaints can also be filed with local intermediate school districts.
The Michigan Department of Civil Rights enforces the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which includes protections from discrimination based on gender, sexuality, religion, race. It also enforces the state’s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act.
Binford said since she hasn’t heard anything back from the federal office, she was advised by an advocate to make a mediation appointment with Macomb Intermediate School District.
Another avenue for parents are lawsuits. However, legal cases are costly and timely. The standard of proof in the court system is also higher than in administrative proceedings.
King said after years of fighting for her son, she is left with limited choices.
“I feel hopeless,” she said. “I don’t know where to go from here.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — Saying that fossil fuels’ role in causing climate change is “subject to debate,” Republican Senate President Robert Stivers touted President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry as a “step in the right direction” toward making the United States and Kentucky competitive in coal production again. 
Stivers, who was among Kentuckians present when Trump signed the executive orders last week, told reporters Tuesday morning Trump is offering a “two-pronged approach” by first incentivizing coal mining and distribution and then expediting the process to get coal mining permits. Stivers said the policies put “Kentucky in a good position” to be “a low-cost energy producer.” 
Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

Stivers said producing more coal is also a national security issue, so the U.S. can control more of its own resources instead of relying on importing energy materials. The U.S. already has significantly decreased its dependence on energy from other countries.
The U.S. has been a net exporter of energy since 2019, reports the U.S. Energy Information Agency, and a net coal exporter since at least 1949. In 2023, annual U.S. coal exports increased by about 15% and equaled about 8% of total energy exports, reports the agency. The U.S. is most dependent on other countries for crude oil which accounted for the largest share of U.S. energy imports in 2023.
When Stivers was elected to the legislature in 1997, the state generated nearly $300 million annually in coal severance tax, he said. In the last few years, it’s been close to $100 million, which is a “a reflection of production,” which has declined steeply, Stivers added. 
The Trump administration policies are likely to be an economic booster in Kentucky, Stivers predicted. Coal production in Stivers’ home of Clay County in Eastern Kentucky peaked at 2.5 million tons annually in 1980, according to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Clay County now produces no coal. 
In recent years, Western Kentucky — led by an Alliance Resource Partners mine in Union County — has surpassed Eastern Kentucky in coal production. 
  Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers posted photos of his White House visit on X, formerly Twitter. (Screenshot)
Alliance Partners CEO Joe Craft, a Republican megadonor, also was at the White House with Stivers last week to watch Trump vow to revive “beautiful, clean coal,” a promise he also made in his first term.
“It won’t just be miners going back to work,” Stivers said. “It’ll be all the peripheral jobs that will come back, that you’ll see that used to be there … supply stores, lumber companies, little grocery stores, mom and pop operations. That’s the hope.” 
Kentucky generated about 68% of its electricity from coal in 2023, the third-highest of all states. Over the last 25 years, Kentucky has fallen from producing the country’s cheapest power to the 12th cheapest as natural gas, solar and wind have often become cheaper than maintaining aging coal-fired power plants. The last large coal-fired power plant built in the country was in 2013.
During the press conference, Stivers pushed back on fossil fuels like coal contributing to climate change. He said “the assumption that fossil fuels are a contributor to climate change is subject to debate.” Stivers’ assertion contradicts scientific studies that consistently identify the heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — as by far the leading cause of climate change. 
“If it is a factor in climate change, do you want us with some of the strongest regulatory processes doing more fossil fuels than shipping it and allowing our products to be produced in Russia, China and India that have limited or no environmental concerns and produce way more than what anybody in the United States does in the realm of fossil fuels contaminants?” Stivers said. “I would rather do it here. We’re more cognizant of potential impacts, or at least aware there is an argument of that.” 
China in 2023 released more heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions than any other country, followed by the U.S, India, the European Union and Russia, according to an independent tally. Historically, the U.S. is the world’s  No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases emissions, which accumulate in the atmosphere, because of the country’s earlier and rapid industrialization dating back to the 1800s. 
Special legislative session coming?
During the Tuesday press conference, Stivers also was asked about the response to Kentucky’s recent devastating floods, which have renewed conversations about the state’s disaster funds. Before the legislature finished the 2025 legislative session, it passed a law to create a new state aid fund for communities affected by February floods. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said it would not be “enough” to cover damage from those storms. Beshear also has warned that a spending cap imposed by the legislature will limit state resources available for flood recovery.
When asked about Beshear’s concern that the state could run out of funding if it faces another natural disaster this year, Stivers said he finds Beshear’s “lack of knowledge problematic” and that calling the legislature into a special legislative for one day would cost less than the governor traveling to Davos, Switzerland, for an economic forum, or paying the salary of Beshear’s Senior Adviser Rocky Adkins, a former House speaker. 
“He is creating a crisis without the crisis existing,” Stivers said. “One day is all it takes.”

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho will try to ban a food assistance program from covering candy and soda.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which requires the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement known as “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers. 
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement Tuesday. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
 How will the SNAP bill affect local retailers?

Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws. 
Idaho’s new law takes effect July 1.

In a prepared statement, Washington, DC.-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center SNAP Deputy Director Gina Plata-Nino critiqued SNAP restrictions, saying they “only deepen food insecurity and strip people of their autonomy.”
“This push to restrict what Idaho households can buy is an ill-conceived, recycled attempt to shame people who need food assistance and strip them of their dignity and autonomy when data shows that their diet isn’t much different from anyone else’s,” Plata-Nino told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Little signed the bill into law on Tuesday, the governor’s office announced in a news release. The bill passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments. 
In the Idaho governor’s office news release announcing Little signed the bill, Kennedy wrote in a prepared statement, “I urge all governors to follow Idaho’s lead and submit innovative SNAP waivers to the USDA to reverse the childhood chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
 Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say

Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight. 
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.

Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact on the state budget.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement she was excited more states “are heeding the call to Make America Healthy Again.”
“Governor Little is a true partner to USDA, and we look forward to working together on ways to use SNAP to improve health outcomes for Americans and encourage better use of taxpayer dollars,” she added.

Ten schools across Delaware have been awarded the Purple Star School designation for 2025, a recognition of their exceptional efforts to support students from military families.
The honored schools span two districts: Caesar Rodney School District’s Allen Frear Elementary, David E. Robinson Elementary, Major George S. Welch Elementary, Nellie Stokes Elementary, and Star Hill Elementary, and Lake Forest School District’s Lake Forest Central Elementary, East Elementary, North Elementary, South Elementary, and W.T. Chipman Middle School.
The schools will be officially recognized this afternoon during a ceremony where Governor Matt Meyer will also proclaim April as the Month of the Military Child—a national observance highlighting the challenges faced by children whose families serve in the armed forces.

Military members’ children make sacrifices just like their parents and caregivers, missing time with their loved ones when they are deployed overseas and sometimes making frequent school transitions when their families’ military stations change.
“These children face challenges and have needs unique to their non-military peers. I thank these schools for recognizing the hardships and seeking ways to better support these students,” said Jennifer Davis, Delaware commissioner for the Military Interstate Children’s Compact Commission. “Military members’ children make sacrifices just like their parents and caregivers—missing time with loved ones and often changing schools. I thank these schools for recognizing the hardships and seeking ways to better support these students.”
Schools that receive the Purple Star designation must meet several criteria, including appointing a dedicated military liaison, offering school-wide training for staff, providing online resources for military families, and implementing transition programs and peer support systems.
At Allen Frear Elementary, for example, students with deployed parents or those adjusting to new environments can participate in peer-to-peer support groups facilitated by the school counselor.
These groups provide a space for children to connect, share experiences, and build resilience.
W.T. Chipman Middle School cited its comprehensive approach—including structured transition programs, mentorship opportunities, and family engagement efforts—as key to creating a welcoming environment for military-connected students.
Delaware’s Purple Star designation remains valid for three years.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The way Kansas LGBTQ+ youths in foster care are placed into homes could change after lawmakers forced a bill into law that permits foster children to be placed with families who don’t affirm a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity based on the parents’ religious or moral beliefs.
Republicans argued that Kansas is at risk of losing needed foster families, and the bill prevents the state from discriminating against parents, even though their beliefs might conflict with a child’s sexuality or gender identity. 
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, vetoed the bill April 7, characterizing it as a departure from the Kansas Department for Children and Families’ adherence to the “best interest of the child” standard.
“Legislation like this detracts from this standard and stands in the way of best serving those in the child welfare system,” Kelly wrote in her veto message.
She also feared the legislation could open the state up to lawsuits.
The House overrode House Bill 2311 Thursday in an 87-38 vote, with Emporia Republican Rep. Mark Schreiber joining Democrats in opposition. Senate Republicans overrode it the same day in a 31-9 vote along party lines.
Kerrie Lonard of the Kansas Office of the Child Advocate said her office recognizes the proponents’ intent, the concerns of those opposed and the possibility for unintended consequences.
It will be “cognizant,” Lonard said, of the implementation of HB 2311, which includes “recruitment and training of foster parents, and in placement decisions, specific to increased placement options or potential harm or actions that do not maintain best interest of the child as the guiding center.”
Foster care youths are entitled to basic rights under the Gail Finney Memorial Foster Care Bill of Rights, which was codified in 2023.
Embedded in that bill of rights, Lonard said, is the right to “live in a safe, comfortable placement,” to “be treated with respect” and to live with “someone from such child’s community with similar religious beliefs or ethnic heritage.”
The office “will advocate that placement decisions are made with respect to foster children’s statutorily protected rights and in their best interests,” Lonard said.
HB 2311, which is set to go into law as soon as it is published in the Kansas Register, forbids the state’s foster care agency from creating policies for a child’s placement, custody or adoption that require a foster parent to “affirm, accept or support” a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity that may conflict with the parents’ religious or moral beliefs. It bars rejections of eligible foster parents based on their religious or moral beliefs on sexuality or gender. 
The state cannot reject parents if they intend “to guide or instruct a child” consistent with their beliefs, the bill said.
People can sue the agency for damages and attorney fees if barriers to foster care or adoption are enforced after July 1.
The Kansas foster care system has endured a rocky history, and it is currently measuring court-mandated improvements to course correct. Brenna Visocsky of the Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, which submitted testimony to the House Committee on Child Welfare, said HB 2311 doesn’t fix any of the state’s prevailing problems. She said it furthers them instead.
“Considering that conversion therapy is still legal in this state, there is the potential for serious harm coming to LGBTQ children placed with anti-LGBTQ foster parents,” said Visocsky.
Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative Christian legal advocacy group, applauded the effort and Kansas Family Voice, a Christian organization that lobbies on abortion, sexuality and parental rights.
Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the alliance, said other states have put politics over people when it comes to religious families in the foster care system, but not Kansas.
“The Kansas Legislature correctly voted to override Gov. Kelly’s misguided veto,” he said in a statement. “This is a critical step to prioritize the well-being of kids by prohibiting state and local government officials from discriminating against adoption and foster care providers and parents simply because of their religious beliefs and moral convictions.”
Rep. Jarrod Ousley, a Merriam Democrat, said the bill puts the foster parents’ sincerely held religious beliefs ahead of kids’ sexual orientation or gender identity.
“This was a bad bill when we heard it last time,” Ousley said on the House floor. “This sends a terrible signal to a vulnerable population in the state of Kansas.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, rebutted the idea that religious freedoms are under attack.
“Religious liberty is well-protected in Kansas,” she said. “What is not well protected in Kansas are children and their rights.”
The bill isn’t needed, she said.
“The purpose of the bill really is to discriminate against a certain child,” Ruiz said, “a child that may be talking, speaking about, that they may be transgender.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100393-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-15 12:18:27.898653

A Montana man shed hunting in the north-central part of the state shot and killed a grizzly bear on April 11, after it reportedly charged him at close range.
According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the hunter was not harmed during the encounter.
The man was searching for antlers on a brushy hillside near Dupuyer when he first saw the adult grizzly. As he left the area, the bear charged at him and the man shot and killed the bear, according to FWP.
The bear was an adult female grizzly estimated to be 13 years old in good condition, according to FWP, with no history of conflict with humans.
FWP also reported the sow had a single yearling cub that was found on site, unharmed, but wildlife officials will not take management action for the yearling.
This is the 1st known grizzly bear mortality in 2025 according to FWP’s grizzly mortality dashboard.
The dashboard was launched last year to help the agency increase transparency, educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected, and to show that the state is ready to manage the species on its own.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Scurrying to pass a budget this week as the Tennessee legislature prepares to adjourn, lawmakers are putting their own stamp on the state’s budget despite being hampered by federal cuts that eat into the spending plan.
Republican chairs of the House and Senate finance committee remain uncertain about the impact of reductions in the $24.5 billion the state receives from the federal government.
Similarly, Democrats are asking Gov. Bill Lee’s administration to clue them in on federal cuts that could affect the proposed $59.6 billion spending plan, which is undergoing a bit of transformation as lawmakers put their own ideas into the budget. 
With federal funds making up nearly 42% of the state’s budget, Democrats sent a letter Monday to Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson notifying him that lawmakers need a “clear understanding of current and anticipating reductions” to make decisions.
Federal funds make up 93.4% of Human Services funding, 78.4% of the Department of Military, 61% of the TennCare Bureau, 51.5% of the Transportation Department and 57.8% of the Health Department.
“Understanding the depth and scope of these changes is imperative, not only for budgetary accuracy but also for anticipating impacts on essential services and public trust,” the letter signed by House and Senate Democrats says.



				Federal funds make up nearly 42% of Tennessee’s budget, including 93% of state Human Services funding, 78.4% of the Department of Military and 57.8% of the Tennessee Department of Health.			


The Finance and Administration Department did not respond immediately to questions.
House finance committee Chairman Gary Hicks said this week he is hearing continually from departments about budget cuts emanating from Washington, D.C. He could not pinpoint any large items but said reductions have been made across several areas, such as the Department of Health, forcing the state to find funds to keep programs going. Lawmakers put $4 million Monday into county health departments to make up for grant reductions from the Centers for Disease Control.
As lawmakers started adding their own touches to the budget Monday, they removed tens of millions from the governor’s proposals and added items such as $3 million to an audit of Memphis Shelby County Schools, which would come on top of $3 million already in the governor’s plan for an audit, increased the Attorney General’s Office budget by $4.5 million and inserted $35 million to extend a tax break to broadband internet companies.
“We’re all watching to see what the federal government’s going to do, because quite frankly we don’t know what that’s gonna look like,” Hicks said. “I certainly support what they’re doing up there with trying to make cuts where it’s necessary. So we’ll have our nose pressed to the glass like everybody else to see how that will affect (the state).”
  Tennessee lawmakers have talked about “contingencies” in case of major reductions in federal funds, but they have no “formal plan” to deal with them, said Senate Finance Chair Bo Watson, a Hixson Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Likewise, Senate finance Chairman Bo Watson said cuts are coming in several areas, ranging from the Department of Human Services to the Education Department but predicted that lawmakers won’t know the scope of reductions before the legislature adjourns, especially considering Congress is working on its budget.
“We’ve got to move forward regardless of what’s happening at the federal level,” said Watson, a Hixson Republican. “Hopefully, we can get the budget out this week.”
Tennessee lawmakers have talked about “contingencies” in case of major reductions, but they have no “formal plan” to deal with them, Watson said.
Among the cuts coming from the Trump administration, Second Harvest Food Bank in East Tennessee canceled more than 377,000 pounds of food costing $722,000 because of a funding pause, according to Democrats. 
The Department of Health is ending sexually transmitted infection (STI) monitoring contractors, a move leading Metro Nashville to file suit.
TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program for 1.7 million low-income people, could see funding gaps because of the expiration of a federal match.
In addition, state residents are likely to see energy assistance reductions, some of which could affect 1,000 households in upper East Tennessee, according to Democrats’ letter.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/States Newsroom)Consumer sentiment fell more than 10% in the last month, and according to the University of Michigan’s latest national consumer survey, it’s the fourth straight month of decline.
“Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year. Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu in a release.
Hsu added that the drop was “pervasive and unanimous” across multiple factors including age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.
The index is published monthly by the university, and is an indicator of consumers’ confidence in the health of the U.S. economy.
The results, released Friday, came just two days after President Donald Trump reversed course on sweeping tariffs on imported goods, pausing them for 90 days, while keeping in place an across-the-board 10% duty as well as separate tariffs on specific commodities.
While the university’s survey concluded the day before Trump’s announced pause, Hsu said the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has been increasing for five consecutive months and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since the Great Recession.
“This lack of labor market confidence lies in sharp contrast to the past several years, when robust spending was supported primarily by strong labor markets and incomes,” said Hsu.
Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told business journalists at a speech in Virginia that while there was a “still solid” outlook on economic growth, surveys of households and businesses reported “dimming expectations and higher uncertainty” in reaction to Trump administration policies, especially as they related to trade.
The University of Michigan survey noted that inflation expectations for the coming year “surged from 5.0% last month to 6.7% this month,” which was the highest reading in nearly 45 years. That rise was also seen across the political spectrum.
“Long-run inflation expectations climbed from 4.1% in March to 4.4% in April, reflecting a particularly large jump among independents,” said Hsu.

House Bill 133, “NC Farmland and Military Protection Act,” sponsored by Reps. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), Neal Jackson (R-Moore, Randolph), Jeff Zenger (R-Forsyth), and John Bell (R-Goldsboro), would ban “adversarial” foreign governments from purchasing, acquiring, or leasing agricultural land in North Carolina.
The restrictions would also apply to land situated within a 75-mile radius of a military installation — a number influenced by national defense recommendations, Balkcom said — such as Fort Bragg near Fayetteville. A complete list of applicable installations is outlined in the bill text.
The measure comes at the same time that international tensions have been on the rise amidst the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign trade partners.
HB 133 defines “adversarial” foreign governments as the ones subject to the U.S. State Department’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, according to the bill text, but does not explicitly outline the nations.
Its counterpart in the upper chamber, Senate Bill 394, “Prohibit Foreign Ownership of NC Land,” passed the Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee last week and specifies the “adversarial” governments as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
Rep. Phil Sheperd (R-Onslow) asked if the bill had anything to do with legislation in previous years aimed towards reimbursing farmers for the purchase of their land.
Balkcom responded that the bill is more of a preventative measure. Instead of incentivizing farmers to sell their land, it targets foreign groups and bars them from purchasing the property.
“This is basically protecting it from being able to sell, those who do were not given any incentive to do it,” she said.
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) brought up the legality and constitutionality of preventing a landowner from selling their property to a ready, willing buyer.
“Private property rights are crucial here, but so is national security,” Balkcom said. “The way we look at this bill doesn’t impact private buyers or U.S. companies. It applies only to entities controlled by foreign governments designated an adversary from our own federal agency.”
The bill now heads to the House Rules Committee.
Youth social media ban
The committee also approved House Bill 301, “Social Media Protections for Minors Under 16.”
According to a legislative staff summary, the bill would — among other things:

Prohibit social media platforms from allowing minors under the age of 14 to create an account.
Prohibit social media platforms from allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to create an account without parental consent.
Require social media platforms to use age verification to verify the age of account holders.
Authorize the Department of Justice to bring an action for unfair and deceptive trade practices against a social medial platform that violates these provisions and collect a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation.
Authorize a civil action on behalf of a minor account holder and an award of up to $10,000 in
damages.

(Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Around 150,000 student athletes from over 100 colleges had their personal data breached by former University of Michigan assistant football coach Matt Weiss, who hacked their accounts to download thousands of their private intimate photos, according to federal investigators. Now more than 50 women are suing Weiss and the institutions they say failed them.
One of the Jane Does who joined a class action suit against Weiss said the news of the data breach feels like deja vu, saying that she is a survivor of disgraced former Michigan State University physician Larry Nassar who is effectively serving three life sentences for possession of child pornography and sexually assaulting women and girls under the guise of medical treatment.
Another man with power over student athletes and influence in a university was able to exploit their access to students and again, a university “allowed it to happen and said nothing,” the woman said invoking MSU’s highly criticized response to Nassar’s abuse.
“It’s hard to describe the heartbreak of realizing that another institution we trusted has failed to protect us. After everything we went through with Nassar—and all the promises of change that followed—you want to believe that things will be different. That those in power will finally put athlete safety, privacy, and dignity first,” the woman told Michigan Advance. “Accountability should mean more than empty words—it has to involve meaningful, sustained action to prevent harm and rebuild trust. Right now, that still feels a long way off.”
‘It’s not over’: Survivors of Nassar’s abuse say the fight for justice is far from finished

The March indictment states investigators found that from 2015 until 2023, Weiss accessed a database used by athletic trainers at more than 100 colleges and universities and maintained by a third-party vendor, Keffer Development Services in Pennsylvania, to access student and alumni social media and cloud storage accounts in order to download private intimate images.
The allegations in the indictment occurred before and during his tenure at Michigan, where he was employed from February 2021 to January 2023. Before working at the university, he spent more than a decade with the Baltimore Ravens. Weiss was fired in January 2023 shortly after university police opened an investigation into reported computer crimes on the school’s Ann Arbor campus.
Weiss’ time at the university was limited, Kay Jarvis, Michigan director of public affairs, said in a statement Monday, adding the university responded quickly to reports of criminal activity.
The indictment said Weiss would research each targeted athlete for months, even years in some instances, looking for more and more photos and videos, keeping notes on each individual’s body and sexual preference.

MIE_Weiss Indictment 
Weiss was able to get into 3,300 individuals’ emails, social media and cloud storage accounts, the indictment said.
Weiss, who has pled not guilty, was charged March 20 with 24 counts of computer-related crimes. He could not be reached for comment.
News that thousands of students may have had their private images stolen has sent many former and current athletes into a panic. Many have used aliases to protect their identities in the civil suits except for McKenzie Johnson, who told Michigan Advance during a news conference Monday that she hopes by putting a name and a face to this violation, it will help shine a light on it.
Johnson played softball for Grambling State University in Louisiana from 2015 to 2019. She said she’s very concerned what images Weiss may have allegedly gotten his hands on as she navigates the workforce as a young professional.
“I don’t understand how something like this could happen. It’s my goal from this lawsuit to learn more about what has occurred. I can personally say that I’m very anxious about what will come from this and what personal information that he has stolen from me,” Johnson said.

The lawsuits name the university, its regents and Keffer Development Services as defendants.
What Weiss is accused of is nothing short of sexual violence, Megan Bonanni, the attorney representing the woman identifying herself as a Nassar survivor and 10 other women in a civil suit, told Michigan Advance.
“This is a digital sexual assault,” Bonnani said. “…And just like a physical sexual assault, the amount of trauma, the amount of complete uncertainty… that’s what we’re seeing from our clients. They do not feel safe, and this feeling that they are unsafe is going to continue into the future.” 
None of the women she is representing, mostly former University of Michigan athletes, have received notification from university officials that their data may have been compromised, Bonnani said. The university could have been an ally to these athletes and supported them, Bonnani added.
Jarvis said in the statement: “Upon learning of potentially concerning activity in its systems, the University promptly placed Mr. Weiss on leave, forwarded this matter to law enforcement authorities and moved forward with Mr. Weiss’ termination on January 21, 2023.”
The woman identifying as a Nassar survivor said the university failed to protect athletes, secure their data and alert students and athletes to change their passwords.
“Matt Weiss should never have had the opportunity to violate student privacy, and the University had a responsibility to safeguard our information and be transparent when that trust was broken. Instead, they stayed silent. That’s not just negligence—it’s betrayal,” the woman told Michigan Advance. 
The images and media belonged to the athletes and they had every right to privacy and to victim blame would be to miss the point, said attorney Lisa Esser-Weidenfeller, who is collaborating with Bonnani.
“None of these women, none of them, did anything wrong,” Esser-Weidenfeller said. “I just want to make that super clear. Sometimes you read these stories and you start to read the comments. None of these women, none of these athletes, did anything wrong to contribute to this, right? I mean, it’s like being invaded in the privacy of your own home.”
Bonnani said none of the athletes she’s representing know specifically what images or information were compromised and whose hands they may have been exchanged to.
The civil lawsuits filed in the last month have depicted how the data breach has disrupted student athletes’ lives. One plaintiff, a junior competing for the university referred to as  “Jane Roe,” said she was shocked and humiliated to learn of the data breach on the news and not from the school.
“Plaintiff seeks to hold the Defendants accountable for their actions and inactions that have caused immense fear, anxiety, humiliation, loss of dignity, and loss of privacy that cannot simply be undone,’’ the lawsuit said. 
It was not the first time a University of Michigan staffer was accused of using their position to exploit students. 
More than 1,000 individuals have come forward in recent years with accusations of sexual assault by the late Robert Anderson, a physician who practiced at the university for nearly four decades. The university settled with survivors for $490 million in 2022, but like in the case of Nassar at MSU, survivors have railed for change at university governance meetings and protested for years begging the school to create safeguards for athletes.

 The Army of Survivors, an advocacy group working to protect athletes from sexual violence, said in a statement, Michigan has offered no meaningful public acknowledgment of the harm athletes are facing nor commitment to reviewing accountability structures. 
 “These victims are not footnotes to a scandal, they are human beings whose trust was betrayed, whose dignity was stolen, and who deserve far more than a university’s carefully worded deflections,’’ the group said in the statement. “They deserve answers. They deserve justice. And they deserve institutions willing to stand up and say: ‘We failed you. And we will do better.’”
Real justice, the woman said, would have meant survivors were listened to the first time. It also means reclaiming power, she added.
“For me, justice in this case means more than just punishing one person. It means exposing the full scope of the failure and holding the institution accountable,” the woman said.

Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat from Thornton, speaks at a press conference in Brighton on Aug. 2, 2023. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo is seeking a rematch in 2026 against Rep. Gabe Evans, the Republican who unseated her in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District last year.
“The 8th District deserves a representative who’s looking out for them but Gabe Evans has already shown that he will always put Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and his MAGA backers in Washington first,” Caraveo said in a press release Tuesday announcing her 2026 campaign. “I can’t stand by while Gabe Evans tries to rip away health care from tens of thousands of Coloradans, including the very families I served as a pediatrician, and make life harder for working families.”
Caraveo was elected in 2022 as the first-ever representative for the 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The district is the state’s most diverse — about 40% of its residents are Latino — and most competitive House seat. Caraveo won election in 2022 by about 1,600 votes out of more than 236,000 ballots cast, then lost to Evans by about 2,500 votes last year.
During her time in Congress, Caraveo faced criticism from some progressive Democrats for her moderate voting record, which represented a move to the center relative to her tenure in the state Legislature, where she was a representative. She said during her 2024 reelection bid that her political shift reflected what she called a “responsibility to portray the opinions of my constituents” in a “very evenly divided” district.
By contrast, Evans, also former state representative, has been an unapologetic supporter of his party’s agenda. He has affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to carry out mass deportations of tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and remained silent on the administration’s effort to end birthright citizenship. Last month, Evans voted for House Republicans’ sweeping budget resolution to cut taxes and slash social spending, and he has since falsely claimed that the plan would not force drastic cuts to Medicaid, as nonpartisan congressional budget analysts conclude that it would.
Caraveo’s announcement sets up a primary contest with Democratic state Rep. Manny Rutinel, who previously announced he would challenge Evans and reported a strong first-quarter fundraising haul of over $1 million.
With Republicans holding just a three-vote majority in the House, the 8th District race could again prove crucial in determining control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. The National Republican Congressional Committee on Tuesday quickly slammed Caraveo as a “radical” and predicted the Democratic primary would be a “race to please the far left.”
“While Gabe Evans is delivering commonsense solutions, whoever emerges from the Democrats’ radical rat race will be just another out-of-touch liberal ready to be rejected by Coloradans,” said NRCC spokesperson Zach Bannon.

(File photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)As a former regulator on the South Carolina Public Service Commission, I’ve kept up with national trends that could impact our state and your bank account.
Guess I’m still in the habit.
Here’s a national trend that has the potential to dramatically increase electric utility bills for all classes of ratepayers: new data centers.
State lawmakers around the United States have long sought to attract new industries with generous tax breaks and financial incentives.
But research analysts with Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies, have said these data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenues to cover their tax breaks. The alarm bells are ringing.
We need to stop recruiting new data centers.
Good Jobs First concluded that new data centers are “not a winning program for state budgets.”
Legislators in other states have discovered the increasing risks that data centers bring with them.
Data centers often require upgrades to the state electricity grid. These added costs for new transformers, substations and distribution lines will have to be paid for by all ratepayers through increased utility bills.
New Jersey state Rep. Bob Smith, a Democrat, said “we have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on our citizens.”
Data centers typically run nonstop. They need much more electric power compared to manufacturing plants.
In Oregon, state Democratic Rep. Pam Marsh said “there’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh sponsored a bill that would require data centers to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for their added costs.
Utah just passed a new law that allows large load customers like data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities as a way to insulate residential customers from increasing electricity bills.
Tyson Slocum is the energy program director for Public Citizen, a consumer advocate nonprofit. He observed that “the normal model is you spread that investment costs across all customers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Gary Wood, CEO with Central Virginia Electric Cooperative has more than 30 years of experience in electrical engineering. Wood says that rolling blackouts are very likely in his region in the next few years. He’s concerned about growing electricity loads that these data centers are bringing with them.
A December study commissioned by Virginia legislators found that power demand in the state could double in a decade and increase by up to 183% by 2040.”
Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recently found that consumption could reach more than 30,000 gigawatt hours per month due to new data centers.
Just one gigawatt is a billion watts. To put that in perspective, that’s equal to nearly 2 million solar panels.
The Virginia commission found that new solar facilities, wind generation, new gas plants and transmission facilities will all be needed to meet “unconstrained demand,” which will be “very difficult to achieve.”
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has taken steps to reduce the impact of increasing demand for electricity.
FERC recently approved a request to keep some older power plants running past their expected retirement. The commission also recommended pairing renewable sources like solar with battery storage with natural gas plants.
While this strategy will help, it still won’t meet the challenges created by increasing demand.
Here are my suggestions for South Carolina lawmakers and utilities to consider:
1. Eliminate all financial incentives and tax breaks to new data centers who want to locate in South Carolina.
2. Encourage data centers already here to improve their energy efficiency with newer more efficient computer chips while implementing energy management standards.
3. Require Duke, Dominion and Santee Cooper to create demand response programs for any utility customers who use 25 megawatts or more per year. This would reduce their financial impact on other ratepayers. It would also reduce the impact of future rolling blackouts.
4. Allow South Carolina electric cooperatives to create their own for-profit subsidiaries to provide electricity through retail sales to their customers with load capacity exceeding 90 megawatts.
5. Require electric utilities to install advanced conductors which use aluminum cores instead of steel cores in all new transmission lines. This change would increase transmission capacity by 50%.
These changes can enable South Carolina to meet the increasing demand for electric power.

Laura Kelly sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Education requesting the administration of President Donald Trump reverse a decision to freeze $22.6 million allocated to the state for benefit of students and teachers. This is a 2023 image of Kelly meeting students at Jardine Elementary in Topeka. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly said Tuesday a request was submitted to the U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to reinstate more than $22 million in federal funding appropriated to Kansas to help students who fell behind during the COVID-19 pandemic catch up with peers and to retrain teachers in the science of reading.
The U.S. Department of Education announced in March that approximately $3 billion in pandemic relief funds would be frozen nationwide.
The Kansas State Department of Education had received an extension on the deadline for expending the funds, but the federal government’s latest maneuver reversed that decision. The state Department of Education requested the administration of President Donald Trump set aside the latest plan to sweep the $22.6 million allocated to Kansas. That request is pending at the federal level.
“Abruptly stripping this funding is a disservice to the Kansas students and teachers who rely on it to excel in the classroom,” Kelly said.
In Kansas, the funding in jeopardy was allocated to supporting student learning recovery and ensuring the education workforce was prepared to assist those students with academic deficiencies. The aid also was used to retrain teachers in reading instruction, support students’ career and college exploration and to lower start-up costs for child care providers.
In addition, a portion of the funds was relied on to cover the cost of  licensure, fingerprinting and background check fees for early childhood educators. The Kelly administration began waiving the fees using federal and state funds in 2021. The fees will be reinstated until the Trump administration restores Kansas’ funding allocation, the governor said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2210447-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-15 11:13:25.329018
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 14:51:47+00:00,CT Mirror,What the potential loss of federal housing support would mean for CT,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/ct-hud-housing-funding-loss/,The Trump administration named CT among 34 states that may lose their federal Department of Housing and Urban Development field office.,"Hartford resident Mattie Bell sits in a brown recliner in the living room of her first-floor apartment in Hartford’s north end. The room is dim, with the shades drawn, and the faint scent of cigarette smoke lingers.
She is surrounded by pictures of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, while watching the Home Shopping Network on TV and listening to her two rescue cockatiels, Pretty Girl and Charlie, chirp.
At 76-years-old, Bell has lived in the same apartment in Hartford’s Frog Hollow neighborhood for nearly four decades. It was from that apartment that she raised her three children and cared for her eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
Bell has relied on federal Section 8, or Housing Choice Vouchers, for more than 50 years.
She first received housing assistance as a 25-year-old single mother of three, a decade after moving to Connecticut from Georgia. In Georgia, Bell said assistance like Section 8 wasn’t readily available.
“If you didn’t work, have a little shack of your own, you were in trouble. You had nothing,” Bell said.
Bell is worried about the potential impact federal cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration will have on social services, like housing assistance and social security. Even with the Section 8 voucher, Bell pays $800 a month in rent.
If the worst comes, Bell’s family would take her in. She’s more concerned about others.
“I know how it will be. A person with three or four little kids trying to go to work, trying to pay daycare, they not going to be able to do it,” Bell said.
Bell is one of about 161,000 Connecticut residents who rely on federal rental assistance, which is under threat.
Connecticut’s housing aid needs
The Trump administration named Connecticut among 34 states that may lose their field office for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In 2023, Connecticut received more than $1 billion in funding for federal rental assistance programs.
Brittany Ignace is an attorney with Greater Hartford Legal Aid. Ignace helps low-income residents, including Bell, secure housing aid.
“Many of our clients are seniors or they’re people with disabilities,” Ignace said. “The HUD cuts will have a devastating impact on many families across the state.”
A potential scaling back of HUD support would lead directly to an increase in homelessness, Ignace said. She’s concerned for what her clients’ futures may look like without housing security.
“We see people struggle every day to afford rent, and that matters. This is going to matter for people,” Ignace said. “It is going to affect thousands of families in Connecticut, and it is going to cause a rise in homelessness.”
It’s hard to predict what tangible effect a potential cut would have on Connecticut renters, Ignace said.
“We do think it’s too early to tell,” Ignace said. “What we expect is that a lot of people are going to lose the public housing or vouchers.”

Potential HUD cuts unclear
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said he and his Congressional colleagues on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, have contacted HUD four times for clarification on what, if any, field offices will be eliminated. They received no response.
HUD officials told Connecticut Public that while there were no announced field office closures, the office is exploring consolidation. HUD released a statement which said:
“HUD has not announced any field office closures. To be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, HUD is exploring consolidation while ensuring service to the American people remains the priority.”
HUD field offices are needed, because they do more than administer Section 8 housing vouchers, according to Blumenthal.
“We all know by now that providing a roof over somebody’s head is not the answer. That roof has to be accompanied by counseling and job training and sometimes treatment for substance abuse disorder,” Blumenthal said.
Nationwide, more than $260 million in contracts for housing aid have been canceled.
All citizens should be concerned, as a lack of housing aid would further exacerbate an already strained housing market, according to Blumenthal.
With the potential loss of Connecticut’s HUD field office, Blumenthal is unsure what would become of the state’s housing needs and federal aid recipients.
“We’d have to go, probably, to some regional office in New York or Boston,” Blumenthal said.
But the lack of clarity is part of the problem.
Changes to HUD haven’t specifically called for the defunding or scaling back of financial support for Section 8, but proposals by Trump’s administration call for the firing of half of the HUD staff that administers Housing Choice Vouchers.
There is a lot of confusion surrounding the Trump administration’s execution of cuts to federal jobs and programs, Blumenthal said.
“They fire people first and plan if they’re going to plan at all. And so far, we see no plan for what the field offices are doing, who specifically are going to lose their jobs. It’s all chaos,” Blumenthal said.

Potential HUD cuts may impact CT programs
HUD’s removal would impact more than Section 8 recipients.
Connecticut’s Rental Assistance Program (RAP) may also feel the pressure, according to Chelsea Ross, executive director of the housing policy advocacy group Partnership for Strong Communities.
“We’re concerned about federal cuts to federal funded rental assistance having huge ripple effects everywhere around the country, but in the state as well,” Ross said.
RAP operates in largely the same way as Section 8. The main difference being RAP is funded solely by the state budget and doesn’t rely on federal support.
About 6,500 Connecticut households receive RAP benefits, Ross said. The program’s waitlist has only opened twice in the last 17 years. The last time the waitlist opened was for a week in 2014, when 86,000 residents applied for aid.
Back in Hartford, Mattie Bell says despite what may happen with federal housing aid, she’s vowing to help her neighbors. Local communities have been stepping up to take care of each other, but politics get in the way.
“It’s a scary situation. It’s a sad situation, because we try to help make things better, and yet that is tearing down what people are doing, tearing it down,” Bell said.

U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s order temporarily prohibits the removal of “all noncitizens […],"A view of the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver on May 30, 2023. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Monday ordered President Donald Trump’s administration not to deport any detainees held in Colorado under the 1798 law it invoked last month to send hundreds of people to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s order temporarily prohibits the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Pursuant to that law, Trump’s order claims that the United States is under “invasion” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was the basis for the deportation last month of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the U.S. government is paying for them to be held.
About 90% of the deportees have no criminal record and only a handful had been charged with serious crimes, Bloomberg reported last week. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for many other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.

Sweeney’s order came after lawyers for two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Saturday. Both of the men, who are identified only by their initials out of fear for their safety, have been falsely accused of TdA affiliation and face removal to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act, their attorneys wrote.
The first plaintiff, known as D.B.U., is a 32-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado with his wife and two children. According to the filing, he was arrested during a Jan. 26 raid by Drug Enforcement Administration agents on a makeshift nightclub in Adams County. The DEA’s Rocky Mountain field office described the event as a “Tren de Aragua party,” but subsequently acknowledged that many of those arrested were from countries other than Venezuela, including some European countries, and has refused to release the names of the people taken into custody, say how many of them are suspected TdA members or disclose other details of the operation.
The Colorado lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union, says that D.B.U. fears he will be deported under the Alien Enemies Act because of the DEA’s characterizations of the party, and because he has “a single tattoo of his niece’s name.”
The second plaintiff, R.M.M., not only denies being a member of TdA but says he fled Venezuela to seek asylum after the gang murdered two of his family members. He lived in Aurora with his wife and two children prior to his arrest on March 1. Nearly six weeks later, his attorneys wrote, a “heavily redacted” ICE filing accused him of TdA membership.
“R.M.M. is not and has never been a member of TdA, and in fact, lives in fear of the gang that has already killed two of his family members,” the lawsuit says. “R.M.M. has several tattoos for personal reasons, including one of his birth year, another of a family-member’s name, and a tattoo of religious significance, but they have nothing to do with TdA.”
The ACLU’s lawsuit in Colorado follows two similar challenges in Texas and New York, in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling last week that allowed deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to continue, but only if detainees are given due process and the opportunity to challenge their removal in court. Trump administration officials have subsequently said that detainees could be given 24 hours’ notice of their deportation, putting the plaintiffs and other Colorado detainees “at imminent risk of removal,” the lawsuit says.
“That suggestion not only defies the Supreme Court’s instructions but could mean that petitioners may fail to get meaningful notice or opportunity to seek judicial review before being sent permanently to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, where they could spend the rest of their lives,” ACLU attorneys wrote.
False and exaggerated TdA claims
Trump promised to invoke the Alien Enemies Act during a 2024 campaign stop in Aurora, a city he described as having been “invaded and conquered” by TdA. It was one of a series of false and exaggerated claims about the extent of the gang’s activity in Colorado made by Trump, his top immigration advisers and local far-right political figures in the heat of the 2024 presidential campaign.
Denver and Aurora police officials consistently characterized the gang’s presence as “isolated” and relatively small. The gang has been linked with criminal activity at several Aurora apartment complexes that were home to large numbers of Venezuelan migrants, some of whom sought to blame an absentee “slumlord” who had allowed the buildings to fall into squalor. Contrary to claims by far-right figures that crime has “skyrocketed” in Aurora since the new immigrants arrived, crime rates, consistent with national trends, have declined there and in Colorado as a whole since 2022.
At least two dozen alleged TdA members were arrested for various crimes by Denver-area police departments in 2024. Despite a high-profile attempt to crack down on the gang in recent months — part of a nationwide effort that Trump, during his visit last year, dubbed “Operation Aurora” — federal agents appear to have detained far fewer people with clear ties to the gang. No criminal charges resulted from the DEA’s Jan. 26 raid, the agency later admitted. A subsequent operation led by ICE on Feb. 5 targeted “100+ members” of TdA in the Denver metro area, but agents told Fox News that out of 30 arrests made that day, only one detainee was suspected of TdA ties.
In addition to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, D.B.U. and R.M.M.’s attorneys are seeking a temporary restraining order prohibiting their “summary removal.”
“Numerous accounts, both in declarations and public news reporting, have raised serious questions about the validity of the government’s designations of people as ‘alien enemies,’ with no process provided for anyone to contest those designations,” they wrote. “A TRO is needed because there may not be sufficient time for this court to intervene before people are put on planes to remove petitioners from the United States.”
Sweeney ordered the Trump administration to respond to the motion for a TRO by Thursday, and scheduled a hearing on the motion for April 21. In the meantime, she issued an order that “prohibits the removal from this jurisdiction” of the defendants and similar detainees.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)As every state surrounding Idaho legalized marijuana, state Rep. Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.


Pot laws in South Dakota
Voters in South Dakota rejected a recreational marijuana initiative in 2024, marking the second ballot box failure in a row for legalization.
Voters supported recreational and medical marijuana in 2020, but the state Supreme Court overturned the recreational piece for failure to adhere to the state’s single subject rule for Constitutional amendments.
Lawmakers in Pierre have since tightened restrictions to the voter-approved medical marijuana program. Among other changes, they’ve added provisions to state law to require a medical marijuana patient’s doctor to submit their patient’s name to the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.
In 2024, a group opposed to recreational marijuana called Protecting South Dakota Kids leaned in to the emerging misgivings in other states, listing stories of “marijuana victims” on its website and running ads connecting marijuana use with harder drugs like heroin and methamphetamine.


To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.
“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
‘Critical threat’ to medical marijuana falls as lawmakers consider nine cannabis bills

She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Medical marijuana industry pushes for rule changes and representation as cardholders decline

Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

Now what?,Marissa Martinez | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/federal-child-tax-credit-expansion/,"Many lawmakers want to expand the $2,000-per-child credit, a longtime Democratic priority — but aren’t sure about how to get there.","This story was originally reported by Marissa Martinez of The 19th.  Meet Marissa and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The push to expand the child tax credit is more bipartisan than ever — but a clear solution to stop it from being slashed in half is still far off.
Republicans and Democrats have been juggling proposals for the credit — currently a $2,000-per-child tax incentive — as Congress renegotiates the country’s tax structure. Lawmakers told The 19th they are anxious to pass something this year before the existing bill sunsets this fall and reverts the credit to a baseline $1,000.
“I hope not. We can’t afford to do that,” said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican who has been promoting expanding the credit to encompass more of the working class.
For years, the left has dominated the conversation around the child tax credit, which is claimed by more than 46 million taxpayers each year. Now, some Republicans believe they have ground to gain on populist issues, given the low-income voters they credit for winning control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.
Meanwhile, Democrats have been hammering their counterparts all year on what they view as Republicans’ hypocrisy in supporting an expanded credit as they give more tax cuts to billionaires at the expense of other social programs. 
“Glad they have big proposals, but without them actually delivering it, it’s all talk. At the same time when they’re cutting SNAP benefits, does that make sense?” said California Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax legislation. “Let’s not try to be too cute by half, saying that you’re fighting for working families but you’re hurting them on some other policies.”
During the pandemic, congressional Democrats and then-President Joe Biden temporarily increased the child tax credit to up to $3,600, expanded eligibility to more of the lowest-earning families and delivered monthly checks to recipients, rather than one lump sum. These changes lifted millions of households out of poverty. But the credit reverted back to $2,000 in 2022 — and child poverty rose soon after.
Last year, GOP senators and former Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Independent who used to caucus with Democrats, rejected a tax package that would have moderately increased the credit, part of legislation that had already passed the House with bipartisan support.
Now that lawmakers are closer to passing a budget framework, Congress can soon turn its attention to negotiating border security, energy credits and tax priorities. 
Some Republicans in both chambers are eager to expand the credit, including Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican. Current proposals range from Alabama Sen. Katie Britt’s idea to increase the similar Child and Dependent Care Credit to $4,000 to Hawley’s bill to increase the child tax credit to $5,000 and offset a parent’s payroll taxes.
“There’s real momentum behind it,” Hawley said. “The president wants to deliver tax relief to working people and he understands that we’ve got to put fresh tax relief for working people into this bill. It’s fine to renew the existing cuts, but that’s not going to do anything for working people.”
But this sentiment is still in the minority for the Republican Party, which is ideologically hesitant to spend more on increased credits. Trump and Vice President JD Vance said they wanted to expand it during the campaign, though they did not give details on paying for it. Expanding the child tax credit did not appear on the White House’s priority list earlier this year.
Meanwhile, a group of Democratic senators laid out ambitious plans for an expanded credit on Wednesday. The American Family Act would create a tiered system for the child tax credit based on age: $6,360 for newborns, $4,320 for children age 1 to 6, and $3,600 for children age 6 to 17. It would also be fully refundable, meaning someone can access the credit even if they don’t earn enough to owe income tax.
“We’ve got a strong coalition, but tax policy [under] this administration seems to be so anathema to what we’re trying to do, to the things that we’re fighting for,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of the bill’s sponsors. “I’m just very concerned. They want to give tax cuts to multi-millionaires, we want to give them to expecting moms. … There’s just different views on how we go about this and we’ll see what happens.”
The House and Senate have been tied up in finalizing the year’s budget after GOP holdouts stalled negotiations, and meaningful conversations on the credit and other tax legislation have been mostly surface-level, members of both parties said this week. But that hasn’t stopped Republicans from messaging on the issue — and trying to preemptively push Democrats into a corner for not getting on board with their legislation in its entirety. 
“REMINDER: If the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts are not extended, 40 MILLION families will see their Child Tax Credit cut in half,” the House GOP account posted on X Tuesday. “Passing the budget reconciliation bill would prevent the largest tax hike in American history.”
The reach tax credits have had for families is also shrinking. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and other high-profile lawmakers from past eras pressed current leadership earlier this month to expand and make permanent the current tax credit to keep up with inflation, adjusting it to at least $2,500.
Regardless, the Trump administration’s overall approach to economic issues has been unreliable, said Illinois Rep. Danny Davis, another Ways and Means Democrat. The “frenzy” makes it difficult to telegraph what’s next for the child tax credit and other tax priorities once the budget issues are settled, he added.
“Some of their notions, thoughts and ideas are awfully ridiculous and off-the-chart. But I do think they respond to pressure, and the pressure the American people are putting on them causes them to go back-and-forth,” Davis said. “That’s not the best way to run an airplane, that’s not the best way to run a government.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0717_ChildCareStory-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 11:13:25.329018

(Photo courtesy of the Law Offices of the Public Defender)Philip Larragoite, chief of staff for the New Mexico Legislature’s Senate Judiciary Committee, says his measure of a legislative session’s success isn’t so much the bills lawmakers passed but, rather, the ones they did not.
“You can’t hear ‘em all, and the Judiciary Committee in the Senate was pretty rigorous about what it hears and what it acts on,” Larragoite told the state Public Defender Commission on Friday during its regular meeting in Albuquerque — its first since the session ended on March 22. “Our Constitution is hard-wired — it’s supposed to be hard to adopt legislation, hard to pass bills.”
The commission oversees the Law Offices of the Public Defender, the independent state agency that employs public defenders who represent anyone charged with a crime in New Mexico.
Larragoite, who is also LOPD’s deputy chief of policy and statewide offices, noted that he has participated in more than 70 legislative sessions, the earliest in 1961 as a page for Jack Campbell, who was House Speaker at the time.
Appellate Defender Kim Chavez Cook, who also works as LOPD’s policy advocate during legislation sessions, agreed that it is important to note the bills that did not pass.
She highlighted two examples of bills that were “priorities for us to stop”: House Bill 204, a proposal that comes up every year to try to remove defense pre-trial interviews from certain cases; and House Bill 190, which would have given alleged victims in criminal cases the right to be a litigant in those cases.
Chavez Cook said LOPD had “serious due process concerns” with HB204, and put a lot of time and energy into discussions about it. HB190 raised “some serious separation of powers and other related concerns,” she said. Neither bill received a single vote in committee this year.
“We’ll keep doing that year after year, many of these things will come back again,” Chavez Cook said.
No new public defender jobs in budget
Policy aside, Chief Public Defender Bennet Baur told the Commission on Friday he was disappointed by the budget outcomes. During the recent session, his agency asked lawmakers for a nearly 13% increase in its annual budget but only received a 4.1% increase.
Lawmakers did not give LOPD any money for additional full-time staff positions, Baur said, but they did give the agency $450,000 to spend over the next two years for recruitment and retention.
Hundreds of additional public defenders would be needed to properly handle all of the cases coming through the state’s criminal legal system, and there is a longstanding disparity of resources between public defenders and their opponents in court, district attorneys.
The American Bar Association found in 2022 that New Mexico needs at least 602 full-time attorneys and is currently only meeting 33% of clients who need a legal defense.
Baur said many lawmakers were concerned about the economy in the U.S. and the state as they considered the budget, and are probably even more concerned about it now than they were during the session.
In the last four years, he said, lawmakers have funded 54 new staff positions. LOPD has an overall vacancy rate of 11%, better than most state agencies, he said. That rate is higher for attorney positions, at 16.8%, he said.
Many public defenders aren’t actually full-time staff employed by LOPD, but are contractors who are paid a flat fee for taking on cases rather than an hourly rate.
For example, when a contractor takes on a first-degree murder case, the state pays them a base rate of $5,400. For the whole case. That means, on average, that attorney is making $13.81 per hour representing their client, according to the ABA’s study.
In some jurisdictions, paying a public defender a flat fee is outlawed, said Commissioner Jacqueline Flores, a former Second Judicial District Court judge.
Baur said lawmakers didn’t give LOPD money to launch a pilot project for paying contract attorneys an hourly rate. But he said he’s determined to still try to do it by “rearranging money” within the agency’s existing budget.
“Those of you that know the budget process know that you never get what you ask for,” Baur said. “But if you don’t ask for it, then you don’t get it.”

Snow classics are currently limited to a guessing game at Mount Alyeska, held to benefit Four Valleys Community School, but if the Senate passes House Bill 50 and Gov. Mike Dunleavy allows it to become law, organizations across the state would be allowed to hold them.
HB50 was sponsored by Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau, who introduced it on behalf of the Juneau Nordic Ski Club.
The tax division of the Alaska Department of Revenue said it believes the bill could be implemented without any impact on the state budget.

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)The Montana Legislature last week approved a bill to boost private community solar projects across the state. 
Shared solar projects are gaining momentum across the country with more than 44 states offering similar programs, according to Sen. Chris Pope, and in Montana through nine of the state’s rural electric cooperatives.
Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, introduced Senate Bill 188, laying out requirements for shared solar projects and how they will connect with the state’s public utilities.
Shared solar projects allow individuals who cannot put solar panels on their own property or business to invest in, and benefit from, solar energy.
Community solar projects are “a small but meaningful part of an all-of-the-above energy approach that’s embraced by our governor and frankly, which is needed, as we know in this committee and in Senate Energy, it’s needed by Montana’s quickly growing electric grid,” Pope told the House Energy, Technology, and Federal Relations Committee on March 24. 
The bill creates a framework for developers to build a solar facility that generates between 50 kilowatts and five megawatts and sell the generated electricity to subscribers located within the service area. Subscribers would receive a monthly bill credit proportional to their share of the project. 
The bill passed both chambers with overwhelming bipartisan support, including a final 46-4 vote in the Senate during the weekend. 
In both the Senate and House committee hearings, more than a dozen groups and individuals testified in support of the legislation, while NorthWestern Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities, Montanan’s largest utilities, opposed the bill. 
SB 188 opens up community solar to individuals who are unable to tap into the solar market otherwise, proponents said, such as those who rent their homes or live in apartment complexes. It also expands opportunities for those who develop solar arrays, including public-private partnerships, individuals such as farmers and ranchers, and can make use of underdeveloped property. 
“These programs provide energy cost savings for households and businesses without needing to install the system on site,” Matthew Hargarten, vice president of government and public affairs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access, said during the house committee hearing. His organization represents more than 130 businesses nationwide that have invested in more than 2,000 shared solar projects. 
“The reality is there’s a lot of research and numerous cost-benefit analyses from around the country that smaller projects bring benefits to the entire electric grid and stabilize long-term cost for all ratepayers,” he said. 
However, Alan Olson, director of government affairs for Northwestern Energy, said he didn’t believe the bill offered a “happy outlook.” 
He, and the representatives of Montana-Dakota Utilities, stated they’d prefer shared solar projects operate as qualifying facilities — an existing program for small-scale generators to use the utility-scale infrastructure. Those projects are regulated by the Public Service Commission.
Olson also brought up concerns over the administrative cost burden utilities would have to bear by keeping track of community solar subscribers; but a House amendment to the bill shifted that responsibility onto the shared solar facility owners. 
Justin Pearce, CEO of A-Team Roofing & Solar in Billings, said the bill would be an economic boon to Montana. 
His veteran-owned company employs 27 people just in their solar department, a number he expects will grow to more than 50 by the end of the year. 
“You might not know this, but Billings has 285, what they call, sun days a year. Phoenix, Arizona, only has 283,” Pearce said. “Energy production in Montana is really good in the solar world. I feel this is one more piece of energy dominance for the state of Montana. So jobs, jobs, jobs.”
Senate Bill 188 was also supported by more than a dozen groups including the Montana Farmers Union, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Blackfeet Nation, Fort Belknap Indian Community, the Chippewa Cree Tribe of Rocky Boy’s, and the Montana Environmental Information Center,
“This is a happy bill,” Pope told the house committee. “And everyone benefits.”
Fifty-four representatives supported SB 188 on third reading in the House and all but four Senators supported the bill in its final Senate vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1323983992-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 11:13:25.329018

From security cameras to facial recognition systems, these devices are typically advertised as critical measures to prevent violence, bullying, and other threats. However, in diverse urban areas, the increased focus on threats from students results in greater monitoring of students, which leads to more disciplinary actions that unfairly affect students of color. 
Tools like security cameras, biometric surveillance, and AI-based behavior monitoring are commonly defended as essential for controlling “chaotic” school settings, yet they also contribute to the criminalization of students who are already viewed as threats because of racial prejudice. In contrast, suburban-white district school resource officers (SROs), who highlight external dangers like school shooters, frequently promote surveillance tactics centered on perimeter security, strengthening the belief that their students require protection rather than oversight.
These misguided efforts to enhance school safety have led to the extensive use of surveillance technology. These actions do not occur in isolation. Enhanced surveillance exacerbates existing racial biases in school discipline, especially by focusing on certain students for heightened scrutiny and penalties. RACCE’S position, informed by student organizing, on school safety is simple. True school safety comes from fully funded, culturally responsive programming and curriculum, not security measures. School safety is our priority. We don’t believe armed or unarmed security guards, SROs, or the use of surveillance technologies guarantee student or staff safety. 
Currently our state legislature is advancing several bills that either ignore science and data on how best to achieve school safety or climate (SB 1374); omit guidelines or a governance mechanism on the use of artificial intelligence in our k-12 schools as surveillance instruments (SB 2);  and a bill that doesn’t close a giant compliance loophole so that all school districts that have SROs adhere to new or current state statute unless there is an updated or new memorandum of understanding put in place by local boards of education (HB 7217). 
For instance, we believe HB 7217 must include provisions that SROs be trained prior to them being placed in schools and meet continuing education credits that ensure they don’t implicitly or explicitly harm student learning while carrying out their duties. Nor do any of these bills explicitly address guidance, compliance or training for SROs or security guards to the Trust Act.  While we support some of the ideas in these bills, we will not support half measures and neither should our elected officials. 
School surveillance disproportionately affects children from vulnerable backgrounds. ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection device, criminalizes underprivileged communities, particularly those with a substantial number of students of color. In Chicago, where ShotSpotter is frequently used, studies show that “more than 90% of alerts lead police to find no evidence to corroborate gunfire.” When a city or school district chooses to use these types of surveillance they also choose to  perpetuate the idea that particular residents of neighborhoods or students at these schools are intrinsically criminal, producing an unfounded sense of danger. 
Surveillance in schools frequently results in increased police presence, which disproportionately affects students who are already heavily policed in their communities. As an example, “gang databases,” which are used to track children suspected of criminal involvement, contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline, where Black and Latino students are arrested at higher rates for minor offenses. What begins as an effort to ensure safe schools rapidly turns into an intrusive monitoring system that sees children as criminals rather than individuals in need of assistance and education.
Surveillance in schools is rationalized as a measure for increasing safety, but actually undermines confidence and produces a fearful environment rather than one of safety. The widespread installation of machines at school entrances that use Artificial Intelligence or biometrics, such as those by Evolv and Opengate, aims to prevent gun violence, but “there is little evidence to prove that any of these companies’ claims are true.”  These gadgets use artificial intelligence to detect concealed weapons, but they frequently trigger false alarms and increase police presence. Some schools use facial recognition technology, but research indicates that such systems can have costly and detrimental repercussions. According to the Advancement Project, constant surveillance produces a climate in which students feel watched, which “prevents young people from fully being able to express themselves.”
In many schools SROs contribute to the erosion of trust. SROs have the same powers as street cops, including the authority to arrest and detain kids, which escalates problems that would otherwise be handled by school personnel. According to the ACLU, “police in schools harm Black students and other students of color,” particularly when combined with monitoring technology. SROs also conduct “threat assessments,” which can be distressing for pupils because they are frequently labeled as potential threats rather than offered assistance. 
This method not only generates fear but also highlights the larger problem of law enforcement perceiving at-risk students as dangers instead of as individuals requiring assistance. Rather than promoting a supportive atmosphere for care and intervention, these evaluations enhance existing biases, unfairly focusing on students from marginalized groups and perpetuating cycles of punishment instead of creating avenues for success. 
Digital monitoring software is also becoming more widely used in schools: “89% of teachers surveyed used software to track students’ activity,” with the goal of identifying disciplinary breaches. These methods raise grave privacy concerns, particularly when students or parents are not aware of the type or scope of ongoing surveillance. Some schools even provide kids with equipment to monitor their activities at home. Following monitoring alarms, schools dispatched police officers to conduct “wellness checks” at students’ homes. These actions blur the distinction between education and law enforcement, further undermining trust.
While supporters of monitoring say that it is important to maintain order, research shows that it does not address the underlying reasons of violence or misbehavior. Instead of establishing a nurturing environment, surveillance technologies turn schools into places of constant observation, where children are seen as threats first and students second. According to the Advancement Project, focusing on monitoring technologies diverts attention away from more serious issues including poverty, inadequate mental health care, and a lack of resources. 
True school safety is achieved not by surveillance, but through comprehensive, community-driven solutions to the underlying challenges.
We also believe student rights are being sacrificed while there is little to no evidence that supports the continued or increased use of a multitude of technologies being placed or piloted in our schools. Therefore we are calling for a statewide moratorium on new surveillance technologies inside schools until our state department of education, through action taken by our state legislature, can establish clear and robust guidelines on what types of surveillance technologies are allowed in schools in Connecticut. 
We call for this with a loud warning that an increase in school surveillance is not a neutral development; rather, it represents a shift toward a society in which privacy is surrendered for the illusion of safety. The rising use of surveillance technologies in schools, such as ShotSpotter, facial recognition, biometrics and AI weapons detection systems, contributes to a culture of suspicion, inequity, and criminality. 
Rather than encouraging a learning environment, they create an atmosphere of constant surveillance in which pupils are treated as suspects rather than individuals with the right to privacy and autonomy. 
If we wish to protect our youth, we must cease using policing and surveillance as a solution. We must strengthen our focus on developing schools that promote students’ well-being, mental health, and emotional development. Only then will we see a real, lasting change in the efforts to keep schools safe.

CHICAGO — On a still-warm early fall morning in September 2019, federal agents walked into the Illinois Capitol building in Springfield and left with boxes of evidence collected from the legislative office of then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago. Roughly 200 miles north, more agents executed search warrants on Sandoval’s home on Chicago’s Southwest Side and his district office in the nearby suburb of Cicero.

But before word of the public raids made the rounds on social media and into early news reports, Sandoval’s colleague, State Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, got a knock on his door at his home on the South Side of Chicago. At first, someone who identified himself as Jones’ cousin told the two FBI agents that the senator wasn’t home — but a little while later recanted the lie and invited them back in from their car.

“How you all doing?” Jones asked the agents, to which FBI Special Agent Timothy O’Brien responded, “Good, good good. How are you?”

“Well, the FBI is at my door, so,” Jones replied with a small laugh.

Nearly six years later, O’Brien took the witness stand Monday afternoon in a Chicago federal courtroom with Jones about 30 feet away flanked by defense attorneys as the lawmaker’s corruption trial nears its end. In the final 20 minutes of testimony before the jury was sent home for the day, prosecutors played the first few moments of the secretly recorded interview with Jones.

The pair of agents can be heard in the 2019 recording telling Jones that they were investigating Sandoval and wanted to ask him some questions. But they didn’t tell Jones that he was also a target of their widespread probe.

When Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri asked O’Brien on Monday why he didn’t tell Jones that information, the agent said that if he’d come right out and said it, there was a “potential that he would not speak with us.”

“And did he ask you whether he was under investigation?” Kolluri asked.

“He did not,” O’Brien said.

Jurors will hear the remainder of the roughly 40-minute interview on Tuesday, during which prosecutors allege Jones lied to O’Brien and his partner — the basis for one of the three charges Jones faces.

The feds also allege Jones agreed to accept bribes from red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-FBI cooperator Omar Maani in exchange for changing a piece of legislation he’d proposed in early 2019 that Maani worried could harm his industry.

Prosecutors say it doesn’t matter that Jones never received the $5,000 from Maani, nor did he ever narrow the legislation in the way that Maani asked for. The only agreement that did come to fruition was a job — or at least several weeks’ worth of payments from Maani — for Jones’ former intern, Christopher Katz.

The jury last week heard Maani quantify the number of people he made secret recordings of as “dozens and dozens and dozens” in the roughly 20 months he was an undercover FBI cooperator beginning in January 2018 until the public raids on Sandoval and others on Sept. 24, 2019.

FBI Special Agent Kelly Shanahan on Monday reiterated that Sandoval was one of the public officials Maani helped the government to charge; the senator pleaded guilty in early 2020 after he began cooperating with the feds’ ongoing investigation. In fact, Shanahan felt moved to “pay my respects” at Sandoval’s funeral after he died in December 2020 from COVID-19 complications. At the time, Shanahan had been working with Sandoval for about a year and said that while she and the two IRS agents who attended the funeral weren’t invited, the late senator’s wife and daughters thanked her for coming.

But Shanahan also revealed Monday that the FBI gave Maani about $75,000 to give to Sandoval during the course of Maani’s cooperation. While Maani had been giving Sandoval perks like cigars and meals for years before the feds approached him, he began giving Sandoval cash after January 2018.

The bribes were meant to buy Sandoval’s continued protection of the red-light camera industry as the chair of the Illinois Senate Transportation Committee. But they were also an exchange for the senator’s help intervening when the Illinois Department of Transportation opposed the approval of red-light camera installations proposed by certain suburbs.

At a June 2019 dinner meant to facilitate a relationship between Maani and Jones, Sandoval demonstrated his own close friendship with Maani, inviting Jones into the circle.

“I’m glad you came, Emil,” Sandoval said. “Omar wants to be your friend.”

After Jones left the Oak Brook steakhouse that night, Maani gave Sandoval his latest installment of cash, which had been in his pocket throughout the hourslong dinner.

Jones didn’t catch the FBI’s attention until March 2019 — more than a year into Maani’s cooperation with the government, after Maani brought up Jones’ newly proposed legislation to Sandoval, who apparently suggested brokering a meeting. Shanahan on Friday said that the FBI “found it interesting” that Jones, “who had filed legislation on red-light cameras,” would be willing to meet with Maani, a co-owner of a red-light camera company.

Maani’s cooperation also helped the feds nab a handful of other public officials who accepted bribes, including mayors of small suburbs just southwest of Chicago who were convinced to pursue red-light cameras from Maani’s company, SafeSpeed.

According to Shanahan, some of those mayors also accepted both cash and other gifts from Maani.

Jones’ defense lawyers jumped on the disparity between what those officials asked for and received versus Jones’ experience with Maani. Attorney Vic Henderson asked Shanahan whether Jones got “any cigars” or “Any tickets to events? Any flights to faraway places?”

“No,” Shanahan said to all three.

“He got a steak, correct?” Henderson asked.

“Yes,” Shanahan said.

“And he got a lemonade,” Henderson stated.

“I believe that’s what he had,” Shanahan replied.

Henderson also asked Shanahan why the FBI didn’t give Maani cash to try to entice Jones at the June dinner, to which Shanahan replied that she didn’t “believe there would’ve been a basis to do that.”

“This was the first time Omar was having dinner with him,” she said of Jones.

“So you didn’t believe he would’ve taken any money in June?” Henderson asked.

“I don’t know that,” Shanahan said. “It was a first meeting.”

But a few weeks later in July 2019, as Maani treated Jones to dinner at the senator’s favorite steakhouse, money did come up as Maani pushed Jones to name a dollar amount that he could contribute to an upcoming campaign fundraiser. After a few minutes of demurring — and chewing his wagyu beef filet — Jones finally acquiesced.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said.

“Done,” Maani replied.

“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

It turned out that the intern, Christopher Katz, hadn’t worked for Jones for a year at that point. Prosecutors on Friday showed the jury late-night texts between the two, with Jones asking Katz — more than 15 years his junior — “I want to see u after” Katz was finished at a strip club.

Jones’ attorney Vic Henderson on Monday pushed Shanahan to agree with his contention that the case was “not about a relationship between the senator and Chris,” but was quickly admonished by U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood to move from an argumentative stance and to just “ask questions to get evidence.”

Maani quickly agreed to hire Katz — and the details were hammered out during yet another dinner between Jones and Maani in August 2019. It was then that Maani told Jones that he didn’t want to raise any suspicions within SafeSpeed about someone connected to Jones getting hired at the company, given Jones’ documented history as not being friendly to the red-light camera industry.

Instead, Maani said he’d hire Katz directly. In a phone call a few days later, Maani told Jones that he didn’t have any work for Katz right away but would put him on his payroll anyway.

“I just wanted to make sure that he’s the type of kid that, you know, when he gets a check and he’s not doing anything right away, that he’s, you know, he’s not gonna be spooked by that,” Maani said on the wiretapped call. “He’s not gonna be weird and stuff. … Is he — would he be cool with that for a while? I mean, does he get it? Does he understand this?”

“Yeah, but um, make sure we find him some work,” Jones replied.

But Maani never gave Katz any assignments. The two never even met before Maani abruptly stopped paying Katz after the investigation went public on Sept. 24, 2019, after the raids on Sandoval and other suburban officials.

In all, Katz collected $1,800 total from six weekly payments, which he testified last week helped him pay for school at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

Police allege that in October 2024, 37-year-old Jeremy Dean McCormick of Indianola took a 15-year-old female and a 16-year-old female on a shopping trip to eastern Iowa. He allegedly took the two teens to a Victoria’s Secret store, where he purchased underwear for both of the girls.
Prior to that incident, police say, one of the two teens had previously gone to a Victoria’s Secret store with McCormick where he purchased underwear for her. According to police, the girl alleged McCormick knew she was a minor and that after both shopping trips, he asked her to send him photos of her in the underwear he had purchased for her.
McCormick has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of grooming. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2025.
Separately, the Iowa Bureau of Emergency Medical and Trauma Services has issued an emergency order suspending McCormick’s EMT license, citing his arrest. The board alleges his “continued practice of emergency medical services constitutes an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare.”

Before adjourning for Spring Recess last week, the state Senate and Assembly appropriations committees moved a total of 115 bills onto their “suspense files.” What follows is a rather opaque process that could end with roughly a third of those bills killed — away from public view and with little to no debate.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, any bill estimated to cost at least $50,000 gets placed on the suspense file. Next month, and again in August, the appropriations committees will either move the bills off of “suspense” so they can advance through the Legislature, or hold them — essentially killing those measures for the session.
Last summer the committees nixed about a third of the 830 bills on suspense. The process can be fast-paced, and with few votes recorded it can be difficult for both the public and even lawmakers who authored the measures, to know why bills were spiked.

Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat whose child tax credit bill died last year in the suspense file: “The way we treat the appropriations process is a non-democratic process; I believe that it’s a corrupt process.”

That same summer, other lawmakers and advocates accused Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration of inflating the cost estimates of health care bills in order to block them by way of the suspense process. A spokesperson for the administration said the claim was “outrageous and inaccurate.”
Lorena Gonzalez, a former chairperson of the Assembly Appropriations Committee and current president of the California Labor Federation, does not consider the suspense file process to be secretive, however. She said anyone can review the committees’ fiscal analyses and comment.
The bills placed on suspense last week included measures that would allow homeless students to live out of their cars; require food sold in prison vending machines be priced at market retail price; and create the California Latino Commission.

Conflict of interest?

California’s lieutenant governor and 2026 gubernatorial hopeful Eleni Kounalakis has real estate holdings that netted her hundreds of thousands of dollars last year. Though she isn’t prohibited from making money off these properties, the earnings could potentially cause a conflict of interest if she wins her bid for California’s highest office, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In addition to owning a stake in grazing land, solar fields and properties across Northern California and the Central Valley, Kounalakis receives income from three buildings around the state Capitol where interest groups, lobbyists and others with business in state government hold their operations.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Kounalakis’ campaign said if she is elected governor, she will place “any assets that may present a conflict of interest into a blind trust.”
But John Pelissero, the director of government ethics at Santa Clara University, said Kounalakis would have been well-advised to distance herself from these assets as lieutenant governor.

Pelissero: “If she’s benefiting financially from lobbying, then the optics of it are troubling. It would be reasonable for any member of the public to look at that and say, ‘That’s odd.’”

Newsom allocates money to wildfire prevention

Three months after deadly wildfires swept through Los Angeles County and killed 30 people, Gov. Newsom signed legislation Monday to provide more than $170 million in state funding to help prevent wildfires, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
The money comes from Proposition 4, a $10 billion bond measure voters approved in November. Six conservancies operating under the governor’s Resources Agency will receive the money to manage vegetation removal and forest thinning around their regions. At least half of the money will go to conservancies in Southern California, while a third will go to conservancies in the Sierra Nevada.
The governor also issued an executive order Monday that enables projects funded from the new legislation to benefit from a March emergency proclamation. The proclamation put a temporary statewide pause on certain provisions of two key California environmental laws to speed up wildfire prevention efforts. Some environmental groups have criticized the order.

Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity: “This funding doubles down on forest destruction rather than investing in real wildfire safety measures like home hardening in communities.”

Nearly half a year into into the dispute, eight striking Kaiser mental health workers wrapped up a hunger strike as broken-off negotiations  were set to resume. 


Nearly six months into their labor union dispute against Southern California Kaiser Permanente, eight mental health care workers banded together last week in an organized five-day hunger strike to highlight their cause.
“Kaiser’s trying to starve us out, that’s clear — so, give them what they want,” said Adriana Webb, a member of the National Union of Healthcare Workers who chose to subsist solely on water and electrolytes from Monday morning through Friday evening. “I feel hungry for equity. I feel hungry for change. How is this any different?”
Now engaged in the longest mental health strike in U.S. history, the Southern California workers have been seeking a new union contract that would include:

more mandated time between therapy sessions for patient follow up
restoration of pension benefits that were removed from new employee contracts in 2015
cost-of-living wage adjustments

After a long list of Democratic members of the state Assembly and Senate wrote Kaiser in December urging it to accept the union’s “reasonable contract proposals” — and after Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Feb. 6 written request for both sides “to prioritize the common good that have allowed Californians to rise above our difficulties and resolve our differences” — state Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly and former Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg have agreed to mediate.
Kaiser executives threw their hands up and walked out of mediation talks on March 11 when the union continued pressing  its three major contract issues. Today bargaining talks are scheduled to resume.
Steinberg mediated a similar open-ended strike for Northern California Kaiser mental health care workers in 2022, which lasted 10 weeks and resulted in Kaiser meeting most of the union’s demands.
“We know Kaiser can provide all these things if they wanted to,” said Webb, a medical social worker in the infectious disease unit who stood on the picket line in front of Kaiser’s Los Angeles Medical Center on Sunset Boulevard. “They already provide it to our Northern California counterparts, and all we’re asking for is the same thing. Kaiser still can’t explain why we deserve less or our patients deserve less.”
In a written response to CalMatters questions, Kaiser Permanente spokesperson Terry Kanakri discussed Kaiser’s overall commitment to work with more than 40 unions that represent 80% of its employees.
“Every one of the 80 contracts is different, and each reflects the differences in operational needs, local market economics and wages, professional classifications of the employees in each local, and a host of other factors,” said Kanakri.
“Our goal is and has always been to reach an agreement that makes Kaiser Permanente the best place to give and receive care. We have made — and repeatedly improved — our proposals during bargaining in an effort to reach an agreement. However, in nearly nine months of bargaining, NUHW has made very little movement on the key bargaining issues.”

Although not aware of any specific details of the 2022 NorCal strike or the current SoCal strikes, University of Southern California professor of healthcare finances and economics Glenn Melnick gave his overview on today’s health care labor climate.
“Northern California has the highest wage index in the country,” he said. “I think it’s 20 points higher than L.A. — maybe 25%. So there’s economic reasons why there’s differences. An economist would say, ‘Mental health care worker, you want these benefits? Move to San Francisco.’
“And many employers are cutting back pension benefits these days. Ten or 15 years ago, pension benefits were much more generous across the board. Kaiser could easily afford to give them these benefits and not think twice, but it’s bigger than just these workers. It’s the ripple effect, right?”
Melnick also speculated that health care workers’ negotiating power has waned as the COVID pandemic, which drove demand for their services, has somewhat subsided.

From April 8 through 12, the hunger strikers spent eight-hour days alongside their picketing fellow union members and each night together fasting at a West Hollywood church. Sleeping in a community space barely big enough for eight air mattresses huddled beside the piano against a back wall, they shared a bathroom and took turns showering in a motel room next door.
Medically cleared beforehand, they received daily wellness checks from volunteer union nurses.
“Right now, I feel like I could go another month,” said Zhane Sandoval, propped up on an elbow from their mattress on the morning of April 11, day four of the hunger strike. “So test me, Kaiser!
“Kaiser says that it’s a union employer, but all we’re seeing is union busting. All we’re seeing is separation, trying to divide. But their efforts just lead us to unite.”
Union organizer Rachel Forgash, who stayed overnight with the hunger strikers at the church, expressed frustration over the protracted standoff.
“Kaiser has exceeded all of our expectations in their unwillingness to bargain in good faith and drag this out as long as possible,” she said. “In Southern California, they’re about to start bargaining with the Alliance, which is a huge group of unions at Kaiser, and I think they’re afraid that — when we win — it’s going to set a precedent for other unions to fight just as hard.”

Aida Valvidia, a psychiatric social worker at Kaiser’s Sylmar facility, and Melissa Chavez, a medical social worker at Riverside, both started working for Kaiser before the 2015 contract negotiations reached a settlement, so they each have pension benefits that 70% of their fellow mental health care union members do not. Yet both chose to participate in the hunger strike.
“For the people who don’t have pensions, I think it’s unfair,” said Valvidia. “Why do I have a pension and you don’t? Because you started later? That makes no sense to me. We’re equals.”
Chavez and her husband have been on strike together since Oct. 21. “Kaiser members deserve equity and access to timely quality care,” she said. “Workers are experiencing high caseloads, inadequate and unsafe staffing, lack of time, lack of tools.”
The hunger strike week started with iconic labor leader and activist Dolores Huerta visiting the picketers on April 8, two days before her 95th birthday. “I know that you’re not just doing this on your own behalf,” said Huerta, surrounded by cheering union members in their red union T-shirts. “You’re actually doing this on behalf of all the patients at Kaiser that are not getting the mental health services that they deserve.”
The union cites a recent 88-page report from the state Department of Managed Health Care, which notes that Kaiser’s failures to remedy 19 of the 20 violations in 2022 led to $200 million in state fines. The union has also filed its own complaints alleging Kaiser mismanages patient triage and appointment scheduling, by hiring unlicensed clerical staff and using algorithmic programming.

“Despite the persistent efforts of NUHW to mislead the public, the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) has not identified new deficiencies in our mental health care,” said Kanakri’s statement. It went on to say that Kaiser met with the state department “last week in our first quarterly review and demonstrated the extraordinary progress we have made on all the deficiencies outlined in the Corrective Action Work Plan.”
“We’re in disbelief,” said hunger striker Nick Nunez, a therapist in Kaiser’s Virtual Medical Center, which lends support to any patients in need across Southern California. “They take out ads in the paper saying everything’s fine — that they’re providing adequate care to their patients and everything is top-notch. It’s so bizarre and unbelievable.”
Andrew Kane worked as an associate clinical social worker at the Los Angeles Medical Center he now pickets and fasted at. “It’s a little odd, a little surreal,” he said, noting that he happened to see a patient in the world outside of Kaiser. “Fortunately — or unfortunately — he didn’t notice me, so we didn’t have to have that interaction.”
Kane started in June 2024, so he’s been on strike longer than he’s received a Kaiser salary.
As the strike persisted without end in sight since October, many workers have returned to Kaiser due to financial concerns. But some communicate the problems they see internally while back at work. 
“They’re actually the ones documenting all the things going wrong,” said hunger striker Kassaundra Gutierrez-Thompson, a psychiatric social worker in Kaiser’s ADAPT virtual online treatment program. “We have DMHC investigators talking to a lot of our returned back staff. Unfortunately, a lot of our managers are combatting them.
“And so, a lot of our members are kind of scared, having to advocate for our patients.They’re fighting a different kind of battle inside.”
Rage Against the Machine guitarist and political labor activist Tom Morello joined the Kaiser picketers on April 9 to perform a short acoustic set, and U.S. Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo visited the strikers April 11.
Hours later, they broke their fast with religious leaders passing around a ceremonial bread loaf.“We can’t just be treated like numbers,” said hunger striker Ana Vargas Garcia, who also saw members remotely through the ADAPT program. “Patients can’t be treated like numbers. There’s real lives behind everyone that we see, behind every worker at Kaiser. That’s a big part of why we’re doing this.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/031025_Kaiser-HungerStrike_JH_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-15 09:04:32.885831

The new provision is tacked onto Senate Bill 150, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby, which originally established a fund to reimburse tuition and book fees for students in community colleges and technical schools. It passed the Senate last month.
A substitute version of the bill adopted Monday by the House Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee consolidates six smaller education bills, including provisions ranging from expanded financial aid opportunities to increased requirements for universities to accept transfer credit.
Among these consolidated bills is one sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melanie Stinnett if Springfield which would remove statutes that grant the University of Missouri and other UM System campuses exclusive license to offer certain doctoral degree programs.
The UM System is the only public university system permitted to grant research doctorate and professional degrees. Other state universities are allowed to partner with the UM System to offer similar degree programs but cannot do so independently.
The amended version of the bill passed Monday out of committee would repeal this provision, specifically to allow Missouri State University to offer programs that compete with those on UM System campuses.
Proponents of the bill say that the exclusivity granted to UM System campuses makes doctoral degrees less accessible to those who do not live near a campus.
“When I look at that, if that is a space that someone is interested in, we really shouldn’t be limiting that for people just because they can’t travel to a specific area of the state,” Stinnett said in a committee hearing last month.
Missouri State University President Richard Williams testified last month that his university simply seeks more flexibility. Missouri State currently offers 10 doctorate programs but is required by state law to do so in partnership with UM System campuses.
“This is relieving restrictions so we can be nimble,” he said.
Opponents to ending UM System’s exclusive power include the University of Missouri Flagship Council, which said in February in a Missourian guest commentary that tuition increases would likely follow as a result.
“The bottom line is that starting doctoral programs at public universities without research funding will need to be propped up with significant state support,” Chuck Brazeale, chair of the Flagship Council’s board of directors, wrote.
The bill passed through the House committee Monday by a vote of 10 to 1, with only state Rep. Bill Allen, a Republican from Kansas City, dissenting.

Jason Ward is co-director of the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness. He is also an economist at RAND and a professor of policy analysis at Pardee RAND Graduate School.


The spiraling cost of housing in California has affected virtually every facet of life. 
California has the nation’s largest unsheltered homeless population and among the highest rates of cost-burdened renters and overcrowded homes.
One reason for the seemingly endless upward trajectory of rents is how expensive it is to build new apartments in California. Those costs are a major contributor to “break-even rents,” or what must be charged for a project to be financially feasible. 
I recently led a study that compared total apartment development costs in California to those in Colorado and Texas. The average apartment in Texas costs roughly $150,000 to produce; in California, building the same apartment costs around $430,000, or 2.8 times more. Colorado occupies a middle ground, with an average cost of around $240,000 per unit.
For publicly subsidized, affordable apartments — a sector that California has spent billions on in recent years — the gap is even worse. These cost over four times as much as affordable apartment units do in Colorado and Texas.
There’s no single factor driving these huge differences. Land costs in California are over three times the Texas average. “Hard costs,” or those related to improving the land and constructing buildings, are 2.2 times those in Texas. California’s “soft costs,” which include financing, architectural and engineering fees, and development fees charged by local governments, are 3.8 times the Texas average. 
There are some unavoidable California-specific costs, like ensuring buildings are resilient to shaking from earthquakes. But the truly lifesaving seismic requirements explain only around 6% of hard-cost differences, the study estimated. The state’s strict energy efficiency requirements add around 7%.
California’s high cost of living may drive up the price of labor, but we found that construction wage differences explain only 6% to 10% of hard cost differences for market-rate apartments. However, for publicly subsidized apartment projects, which are often mandated to pay union-level wages, labor expenses explain as much as 20% to 35% of the total difference in costs between California and Texas. 
“Soft costs” in California are a major culprit. California property developers pay remarkably high fees for architectural and engineering services — triple the average cost in Texas. It’s five times as much or more if you’re building publicly funded, affordable apartments in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas. 
Seismic engineering requirements play a role. The bigger factor are complex and burdensome design requirements for affordable housing. These are dictated by state and local funding sources, and have little to do with habitability or safety but contribute substantially to these astonishing differences. 
Development fees to local governments make up the largest soft-cost difference in California. Such fees, which were the subject of a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court case, average around $30,000 per unit. In Texas, the average is about $800. (Again, Colorado occupies a middle ground at around $12,000.) 
In San Diego, for example, these fees on average eat up 14% of total development costs per apartment.
But the biggest thing driving up California apartment costs? Time. 
A privately financed apartment building that takes just over two years to produce from start to finish in Texas would take over four years in California. It takes twice as long to gain project approvals and the construction timeline is 1.5 times longer. 
That means land costs must be carried for longer, equipment and labor are on jobsites longer, and that loans are taken out for a longer term, and so on. 
Most of the differences that the study uncovered stem from policy choices made by state and local governments. Many are legacies of the so-called “slow growth movement” in California, which has shaped housing production since the 1980s. 
Those efforts worked. Population growth in the state went negative for a few years after 2020, due primarily to the high cost of housing. Even more recently, California’s growth was half the numbers seen in Texas and Florida, with younger and higher earners disproportionately leaving. 
These departures have dire implications for the state’s fiscal future and political influence nationally. California recently lost a congressional seat for the first time in its history. If current national population trends hold, it could lose four or five seats in 2030.
The California Legislature has become increasingly focused on reducing the cost of living, but meeting this goal requires substantial progress on lowering housing costs. New proposals to exempt urban infill housing production from state environmental law and a package of permitting reforms are steps in that direction. 
Will policymakers also take lessons from Texas and Colorado’s cheaper housing methods? That remains to be seen. But the future of California may well hinge on it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-15 09:04:32.885831

Too many grocery workers in our state work hard but struggle to get by. Whether buying groceries in the checkout line or running the register, they are being pushed to their limits.
Housing and food prices have soared in Minnesota, and for many, owning a home and being able to retire are out of reach. If something does not change soon, the way of life we all love here in Minnesota will disappear.
Grocery store jobs once provided decent, dignified lives.
Consider this: In 1982, the lowest wage for part-time grocery workers was $5.23 per hour, equivalent to approximately $17.58 in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. Forty-three years later, wages have not kept pace. Today, the lowest-paid part-time grocery workers make just over $11 an hour, a significant decline in real wages.
Meanwhile, housing and food prices have soared, trapping many in a cycle where each paycheck leaves workers short. Multiple jobs are now necessary just to get by.
“I work part-time at Cub to support my family. I don’t want my son to feel guilty watching mom eat less so he can eat more,” says Taylor Boos, who works at Cub. “Some nights, I only eat rice or some toast and a V8 to afford to keep my son well-nourished. I want to make enough to care for my loved ones at the job that I love.”
In a recent consumer survey run by UFCW 663, consumers flagged staffing shortages as a serious issue. And no wonder. Cub’s new staffing strategy is to buy out full-time workers and limit part-time employees to 15 hours per week. Grocery stores are running on skeleton crews. Products aren’t making it to shelves, and customers can’t find what they need. 
Right now, over 9,000 Twin Cities grocery workers are negotiating new contracts, with one goal: to turn grocery jobs into good jobs. Since the pandemic, grocers have been more profitable than they’ve been in a generation — yet instead of working with us to improve jobs, they want to shift health care costs onto workers, refuse to adequately fund the pension, and refuse to provide workers with raises and hours they need to thrive.  
“I work just under 40 hours a week. I need a tooth pulled, but I can’t afford to do that with the wages I’m making now,” says Duane Bluhm, who works at Kowalski’s Markets. “If my health care costs go up and my wages don’t make up for that, I won’t ever be able to get it addressed. My coworkers and I shouldn’t have to choose between our bills and seeing the doctor.”  
Sylvia O’Brien, a part-time Cub cashier, said that after her husband passed away, she had to plan her retirement herself. “Social security isn’t enough to rely on. I’m 70 now, but if I can get the hours that I need, I’ll be able to afford to retire when I’m 80,” she says. “I deserve to be able to retire someday, and I need to have a job that provides a path for a secure retirement.”
UFCW Local 663 members will fight as hard as necessary to settle a fair contract — to save the pension and win the hours and wages workers deserve.
Workers could go on strike this year if an agreement is not reached, and we urge customers to support good jobs in our communities.
America’s essential workers need to not just survive but live a dignified life.
Workers like Taylor, Duane and Sylvia deserve no less.
And the customers are with us.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-80284534-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 09:04:32.885831

A statewide survey of more than 3,400 educators conducted by the Maine Education Policy Research Institute (MEPRI) found that thousands of educators are overwhelmed by increasing disruptions in daily class activity and feel unprepared to manage it — despite that the state has invested in various programs and initiatives aimed at deterring such behavior. The problem, researchers told the Maine Legislature’s Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs on Monday, is that those efforts often lack coordination, technical assistance, and consistent implementation.
The result is exhausted educators, students with unaddressed behavioral needs and inefficient classrooms, the report found. 
“It’s really affecting the wellbeing of both students and staff,” Sarah Wilkinson, assistant professor of Special Education at the University of Southern Maine, told members of the Education Committee during the briefing Monday.
“And we know that if the learning environments are being disrupted and staff are frustrated and fatigued and reluctant, academic instruction is likely not happening at the level that we’d like to see.”
The report also mentioned the lack of state support to help districts adopt what’s known as an Integrated Multi-Tiered System of Supports (I-MTSS), which is a framework designed to identify and address students’ academic, behavioral, and emotional needs. Maine is currently the only state in the nation that does not offer technical assistance for districts using I-MTSS, according to the researchers.
Educators not equipped to handle worsening student behavior
Educators are spending valuable class time every day dealing with student behavior. Nearly all of the more than 3,400 educators that responded to the survey (96%) reported managing disruptive behavior during the 2023–2024 school year, with 77% dealing with it daily. More than half said they managed behavior crises — episodes involving severe or dangerous behavior — and nearly 20% of administrators reported handling such crises multiple times a day.
Educators reported spending up to 48 minutes on a single behavior crisis and losing hundreds of hours each school year managing various levels of behavioral issues, the report said. For some roles, this represents 20% of their annual work time.
General and special education teachers, educational technicians, and administrators also described burnout, emotional stress, physical injuries, and an increasing reluctance to stay in the profession as direct impacts of dealing with student behavior. 
Administrators who participated in focus groups also said that student behavior has become a top concern, especially in elementary grades, and is now one of the biggest challenges to recruiting and retaining staff. Some principals reported spending entire days managing individual students rather than providing academic leadership.
Educators also worry that unaddressed behavior problems could push more general education students into special education — further straining an already overburdened system. Maine currently has the second highest special education identification rate in the country.
Researchers call for more state support
A Multi-Tiered System of Supports, known as MTSS, is essentially a tiered model schools use to ensure all students have their academic, emotional, or behavioral needs met. The system evaluates what tier of support each student needs to stay on pace with their peers, from the most common, tier 1, being general classroom instruction to the least common, tier 3, which includes a small number of students who need personalized instruction or significant mental or behavioral health support interventions. If students don’t make sufficient progress in their assigned tier, MTSS models require districts to intensify personalized support.
The Maine Education Policy Research Institute, a nonpartisan research institute funded by the Maine Legislature and University of Maine System, recommends the model because it helps schools meet students’ needs in a more organized and effective way. The system gives teachers tools to step in early when problems start, instead of reacting after things get worse. When used well, national research has shown that MTSS can reduce behavior issues, improve learning, and make schools feel safer and more supportive. 
So far, the Maine Department of Education has only offered basic introductory training on the system, largely leaving districts on their own to decide how to use the model, researchers said. 
In response to questions about state support for MTSS, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for the department, pointed out that MTSS is currently something that districts can opt into. The department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them, she said.  
However, during the legislative meeting, Wilkinson recommended the department help districts implement the framework, with dedicated resources and support, as well as to expand professional development in behavior management and de-escalation strategies.
“Without those skills, educators will continue to struggle to respond effectively to the behaviors that are occurring,” she said.

(Courtesy of Provo City)About 50 miles from Utah’s capital airport is a small hub that some travelers on the Wasatch Front turn to for ultra-low-cost carriers — the Provo airport. In 2024, about 900,000 passengers used the airport’s four gates to board domestic flights. It was a record-setting number for the facility. However, as soon as this year that number could multiply. 
Provo City broke ground for an airport expansion on Monday. The plans are to build an extended apron, increasing parking capacity for aircrafts by November, according to a news release from the city.

One of the most substantial changes, however, is scheduled to open by late 2028 — the facility’s expansion to host 10 gates in total.  
“Thanks to American Airlines’ frequent daily flights to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Phoenix-Sky Harbor (PHX), travelers from PVU now enjoy easy access to over 270 global destinations, both domestic and international,” Brian Torgersen, Provo Airport director, said in the release. “And the connectivity will only improve with our expansion from four gates to ten gates.”
The funding is secured and the demand is growing, the release reads, especially with major events on the state’s horizon. The project’s price tag is $80 million, according to a presentation filed to the Legislature, which will be paid by different programs from the Federal Aviation Administration, the state, Utah County, Mountainland Association of Governments, and Provo City. 
This year, lawmakers also approved a one-time payment of $4.5 million to support the project. 
“This expansion positions PVU not just as a regional airport, but as a vital part of Utah’s growing transportation network — ready to welcome the world, including visitors for the 2034 Winter Olympics,” Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi said in a statement.

But plans will continue beyond this development. By summer 2026, the airport is also scheduled to have a master plan for another two decades. 
Utah County pledged $78 million to help fund the expansion, including a $19.5 million up-front payment gathered with a tourism tax, and an annual contribution of $3.9 million for the next 15 years, according to a Utah County news release. The investment would contribute to the gates’ expansion, as well as efforts to grow baggage handling and ticketing areas, and prepare it for international travel.
“This expansion is more than just bricks and mortar — it’s a bold step into the future,” Utah County Commissioner Amelia Powers Gardner said in the release. “We’re building infrastructure that not only meets today’s needs but sets the stage for tomorrow’s growth, global events, and economic opportunity.”

The House passed legislation he filed to allow judges to issue percentage bonds. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday approved legislation allowing defendants to pay less than the full amount of the bond to be released from jail as their cases proceed in court.
HB 42, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, passed 66-32. It allows judges to issue a percentage bond to defendants to be released from pretrial confinement instead of paying a bail bond company to secure their release.
“A few years ago, we passed an amendment to the Alabama Bail Reform Act that removed three words,” England said during the discussion on the floor. “The three words were, ‘a part of,’ so it basically requires the total sum of the bail to be paid in order to secure release. This bill restores those three words so it would allow judges to take partial, percentage bonds.”

If an individual fails to appear in court, the money paid by the defendant will be returned to the court to pay for expenses or restitution.
England filed similar legislation in 2024 that was approved by the House of Representatives but did not come out of the Senate..
The bill leaves just about all the language of the Alabama Bail Reform Act in place but adds the three words that England referred to during the floor discussion back into state statute.
HB 42 has been one of the few criminal justice reform bills that the House chamber has approved for the session. The House Judiciary Committee hosted a public hearing on the legislation in late February with one person speaking on the legislation.
Victor Howard, who owns a bail bond company based in Madison County, said the bill fails to hold people accountable and will not entice people to appear for their scheduled court.When defendants are not able to pay the full amount of their bond, they’ll pay a bail bond company a percentage of the total bail amount, typically 10%, and the company assumes responsibility for the person to appear at their scheduled hearings.
In March, the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve the bill and allow it to move forward to the full House chamber.
Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, who voted for the bill, called it “a small step, but it is a step in the right direction.”.
“We have done so much for title bonds, payday loans, but there is no reform and no oversight on this,” he said during floor discussion. “Let’s work together to take it to the next step.”

In 2021, the legislature passed the “Second Amendment Preservation Act,” which prevented Missouri law officers from enforcing federal gun laws that were considered to be “infringements” on Second Amendment rights.
In 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the act unconstitutional because it violated the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal laws take precedent over state laws.
The court’s decision said that while Missouri could withhold aid to federal enforcement, the language in the original act would negate federal laws directly.
Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican Dixon, proposed bringing the act back with House Bill 1175.
“This is a proposal I have to kind of address what the Eighth Circuit had held and then reenact the substantive provision at the heart of the Second Amendment Preservation Act,” Hardwick said.
Hardwick believes the language of his bill would not be considered unconstitutional. HB 1175 would restrict state agencies from enforcing or aiding in the enforcement of federal gun laws that differ from Missouri’s laws.
Hardwick’s bill would also allow Missourians the ability to sue law enforcement agencies for up to $50,000 per occurrence should they work to enforce or aid in the enforcement of federal gun laws.
“What (Missouri law enforcement) can’t do is be conscripts to the federal government,” Hardwick said, describing the bill.
The original law, as well as Hardwick’s reenactment, have drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies around the state. Police officers from Columbia, Nixa, Versailes, Rolla and Branson were in attendance at Monday’s hearing.
Some concerns presented by law enforcement include potentially frivolous lawsuits brought on by the bill and the potential loss of access to federal resources, like databases.
Aaron Dorr, a gun rights activist for the Missouri Firearms Coalition, attempted to dispel some of these concerns during his testimony. Dorr said the legislation would not affect agencies’ ability to access federal resources or to work with the federal government unless the primary subject of the work was in federal firearm enforcement.
 Police Testimony

While many police who gave testimony agree with the sentiment of the bill, they voiced concern for the unintended consequences they believe could come from the bill.
Columbia Assistant Police Chief Lance Bolinger noted that even if the law does not technically impede agencies, attorneys for law enforcement agencies are likely to take a restrictive approach when dealing with a new Second Amendment law to avoid potential lawsuits.
“Regardless of what the intentions are when we pass these laws, it is how the attorneys for the police department interpret them, that’s what really matters,” Bolinger said, describing the effect of the original law. “Because what (the original law) did for us is it pretty much shut down all of our federal assistance.”
Bolinger said he is concerned that state agencies may stop using federal resources out of fear of litigation if a new Second Amendment act is approved.
When the original law was put into place, one of the things the Columbia Police Department lost was a machine that helps to identify shell casings, Bolinger said. This was because the machine was provided by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
“This weekend in Columbia we had over 100 different shell casings that were dropped on our city,” Bolinger said regarding a shooting at Cosmo Park Saturday. “Trying to put those pieces together and figure out what gun fired what shell casing is going to be impossible without that kind of technology.”
Bolinger also noted that federal prison time for gun violations is often longer than state prison time, which means it’s sometimes advantageous to prosecute suspected criminals for federal charges instead of state.
Sean Fagen, the chief of police in Rolla, said he is an “avid supporter of the Second Amendment,” but voiced concerns about frivolous lawsuits that might arise because of the bill.
Fagen said these lawsuits could potentially stem from cooperation with federal law enforcement relating to narcotics.
“Usually when you have narcotics you have firearms involved,” Fagen said.
Fagen said he fears that if a narcotics case with state and federal cooperation was taken up by federal courts and gun charges were added, Missouri offices could be open to lawsuits.
An unlikely opponent to the bill was Ron Calzone, director of Missouri First, an organization that aims to protect Missouri’s legislative sovereignty from federal overreach. Calzone said he was a champion of the original law, but takes issue with the new proposal because it’s too broad and may interfere with an ongoing push to reinstitute the original law.
Calzone said the bill could potentially go beyond what he sees as federal “infringements” to the Second Amendment, instead applying to all federal laws pertaining to guns.
“The 2021 version of SAPA only forbade state involvement in federal laws we considered to harm the right to keep and bear arms,” Calzone said. “But (this bill) applies to all federal laws quote ‘regarding firearms.’”
Calzone said if the federal government passed a law increasing gun rights, Missouri police would be restricted from helping to enforce those laws under the proposed law.
Joan Haven, a volunteer for Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America, said she believes this legislation would make it harder for law enforcement to stop gun violence.
According to the most recent CDC data compiled in 2022, Missouri ranks fifth among the states in firearm mortality per capita.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Amid rumblings and fear of a larger presence from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Southern Nevada this week, attorneys and immigration groups are urging people to plan ahead but not to panic.
The Nevada Immigration Coalition hosted a virtual press conference Monday to address the concerns they are hearing in the community. 
Numerous immigration attorneys told coalition members that they’ve heard there are “expanded and ongoing ICE activities this week in Las Vegas,” said Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada.
“ICE raids have a devastating impact not only on the detained person but their families, businesses and communities as a whole,” Martin said. “Immigrants in Nevada are the backbone of Nevada’s community and economy. ICE enforcement actions ripple through the schools, churches and businesses we attend.”
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office didn’t respond to questions from Nevada Current about whether their offices have had recent contact with ICE officials regarding potential enforcement efforts happening in the Las Vegas area. ICE also didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
President Donald Trump has ramped up deportation efforts and targeted previously protected immigrant populations for removal since resuming office. To aid in his goal of higher enforcement, Trump rescinded a 2011 policy prohibiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals. 
Immigration agents have also targeted legal permanent residents, visa holders, and at least one individual the Trump administration admitted it wrongfully removed. 
Federal immigration authorities also revoked the visas of international students across the country, including four last week from UNLV.
Martha Menendez, a Nevada immigration attorney and member of the coalition, said Las Vegas hasn’t seen major enforcement actions of the type ICE has executed in other parts of the country. However, as immigration efforts intensify, there is concern that could change soon. 
“There has been a lot of misinformation and chaotic information happening,” Menendez said. “The fact that people are calling and people are scared makes a lot of sense to me.” 
In general, Menendez said across the country immigration agents are using tactics immigration advocates and attorneys “haven’t seen before,” including arrests “without identifying uniforms or gear or arrests without any indications of why” the person is being detained. 
“This isn’t necessarily what we are seeing in Nevada,” she said. “These are federal agents who can easily do that here. That’s one reason why attorneys are also more nervous and sensitive right now. We are seeing a lot of actions we would never imagine we would be seeing.”
Martin said they’ve heard several reports from the community of people potentially being detained including “eight men being arrested from a work site” in Downtown Las Vegas. Martin did not identify the work site. Organizers are trying to determine if the arrests were carried out by plain-clothed immigration agents, who have deployed similar tactics across the country. 
“We’ve also heard from some attorneys in the attorney community that there are possibly 100 ICE agents who have moved into the area to complete an enforcement operation,” Martin said.
Menendez said attorneys she has talked with haven’t heard of any situation in Southern Nevada of agents showing up at people’s homes.  
LVMPD had previously said that its officers “will not enforce immigration violations” or won’t stop, detain or arrest people “on the grounds they are an undocumented immigrant.” If someone is arrested or charged with other alleged crimes, the department will notify ICE officials. 
The passage of the Laken Riley Act, over the opposition of a majority of Democrats in Congress yet supported by Nevada’s entire Democratic congressional delegation, now allows law enforcement to contact ICE when people are detained for nonviolent offenses like shoplifting even when they haven’t been convicted of a crime. 
The coalition also warned people to be weary of misinformation going around. 
Bethany Khan, a spokeswoman with the Culinary Union, said there were “unfounded rumors” being shared on social media that employees with temporary visas were being laid off. 
“Folks need to be really cautious about sharing those rumors,” she said. “We are not expecting 100s of folks to be terminated. That is not correct.”
Know your rights
While groups are uncertain if potential enforcement could happen relatively soon, Menendez said immigrants should be aware of their rights, and plan for the worst case scenario. 
“We want people to be prepared,” Menendez said. “Not because we want them to be scared. Because we want them to protect themselves.”
Menendez said if ICE agents come to people’s homes, they should request to see a judicial warrant before they open the door.
A judicial warrant, which is signed by a federal or state judge, is different from an administrative warrant, which comes from an immigration agency or another federal agency but is not signed by a federal or state judge. 
If agents don’t have a judicial warrant, “they do not have the right to come in to arrest you,” Menendez said. 
If agents have a judicial warrant, “then the one person listed on that warrant should head outside,” she said. 
People at risk “of being deported or separated from their family in any way” should  “prepare a family plan” and “have all the necessary documents in one place,” she said.
ICE agents, like other law enforcement, can enter public stores and businesses, “but can’t come into the backroom unless someone with authority allows them to,” Menendez said.
“If you are stopped, do not tell them anything,” she said. “That’s one of the biggest rights we have: the right to remain silent. You should probably give them your name but no more.”
This includes gathering necessary immigration and financial documents, custody arrangements and even a plan for someone to take care of pets.  
“While we may have dark days ahead, we will always work to protect our freedoms, our families and our communities,” Martin said. “We deserve a brighter future and will continue to fight for it. We’ve stood up to oppression before and have made it to the other side.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector_The Alabama Senate on Thursday passed a bill aimed at streamlining the process for restoring voting rights to some individuals with past felony convictions.
SB 153, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, would require the state’s Board of Pardons and Paroles to develop new procedures to make the restoration process easier. The bill passed the Senate 27-0.
“This requires [Board of Pardons and Paroles] to post notices so people know how to have their rights restored, and once they have met that requirement, that Pardons and Paroles is the one that really is going to be notifying the Secretary of State,” Coleman-Madison said in a phone interview Friday.

Under existing Alabama law, individuals can lose their right to vote following a conviction in state or federal court. They may have that right restored by the Board of Pardons and Paroles if they meet certain requirements, such as paying fines, fees and court costs and having completed their sentence.
The bill seeks to make the restoration process more transparent and accessible. It requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles and the Secretary of State to develop and make available on their websites a specific form and instructions for applying for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote. This applies to individuals who met the eligibility criteria outlined in the state code before Oct. 1, 2025. Applicants would submit this form to the board for review.
The board would be required to provide the secretary of state with the individual’s address and the date their voting rights were restored.
Once the information is received, the secretary of state would then notify both the individual and the board of registrars in the county where the individual resides about the restoration date. The county board of registrars would be required to add the individual’s name back to the poll list and inform the person of their eligibility date, unless the individual had never been registered to vote prior to their conviction.
Coleman-Madison said efforts to streamline the voting rights restoration process go back a few years to when she worked with former Sen. Cam Ward who is now director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles. In an interview Friday, Ward confirmed working with Coleman-Madison and said that he had “no problem” with legislation, calling it a “great idea.”
“I think she just tried to do an administrative streamlining, which I’ve always said should be done anyway,” Ward said, adding that it wouldn’t be a policy change but an administrative one.
Ward said that once a person completes their sentence, they are given a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote in many cases, depending on the crime. He said the individuals then have to take the certificate to the Alabama Secretary of State, where the secretary of state can make the final determination about that individual’s voting eligibility.
“What we do is we go through the process of certifying … the right to vote, and then actually, the Secretary of State makes a final call. We don’t,” Ward said.
Messages seeking comment were left with the Secretary of State’s office.
Coleman-Madison said the bill would most impact people who “come out and try to get their lives back together,” saying that “these are family people who want to be role models for their children and their spouses.”
Coleman-Madison also said it’s important to notify people who had their voting rights restored. The bill would mandate that the Board of Pardons and Paroles publicly post on its website the names of everyone whose voting rights have been restored under the relevant state code section. The Board must list the county where each person was last registered or their last known county of residence if they had never registered before their conviction.
“You can send it to the last known address. They may not get it, but if you put it up on a site, you can let people know you go to that site, and that’s where you can check it,” she said.
The bill moves to the House for consideration.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate Education Policy committee heard from critics and supporters of religious instruction in public schools on Wednesday.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, mirrors HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, which was rejected by the House Education Committee on April 2. The legislation requires local school boards to adopt a policy regarding released time religious instruction (RTRI). Alabama law already allows school boards to adopt a policy, but this legislation would mandate it. 
“I just want to stress again that this is completely optional for students and requires parental consent,” Shelnutt said. “They keep saying it takes away local control. This bill does not take away control of the local board. They have the right to make a policy and they can decide if they want to not do anything.”

Ben Baker, superintendent of Dale County Schools, criticized the legislation, saying it does take away local control from school boards.
“School systems do not need more mandates. Current law leaves the decision to local school boards who are best positioned to determine whether release time instruction aligns with the needs of their community,” he said. 
He said the lack of a definition for “religious instruction” causes many issues and is a threat to his Christian values.
“When it says religious, am I now going to have to release students to go and sacrifice goats and worship goats or maybe some type of satanic thing? I can’t live with that,” he said. “Public schools are not run by out of touch bureaucrats. They’re run by locally elected and appointed community members.”
Jennifer Riggs, a mother from Huntsville, shared her experience with LifeWise Ministry, a nonprofit that does RTRI. 
“As I read about Lifewise I quickly became intrigued and convinced that this program could be the answer to meeting that long felt desire for my children, and others like mine, to have the Bible taught during their school day,” Riggs said.
Riggs said she became part of a steering committee for the ministry that, according to the sample curriculum, teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.” She said her local school board denied her request to have RTRI.
“We then tried to present before our superintendent and we were told no he said there were too many mandates and requirements that we could not be accommodated,” she said.
Marty Griffin, a staff member at the First Baptist Church in Gulf Shores, said the Gulf Shores Superintendents Matt Akin denied the church’s request for a RTRI program. A message seeking comment from Akin was left Monday afternoon.
“We believe their decision was driven by fear. Fear of if we approve this, what if this unusual situation happens,” Griffin said. “We believe that a bill like SB 278 would alleviate that pressure from them to make that decision.”
Ryan Hollingsworth, the executive director of Alabama State Superintendents Association, said RTRI will take more time away from teachers. He said it should be the parent’s responsibility to teach their children about religion on their own time.
“The State Board of Education put a lot of things in place that we have to teach during the school day. All we have in the school year is 1,080 hours,” he said. “I think if you’re a parent and that’s a priority then you make sure in those hours that you have, those 7,680 hours that you have them, that you make that work.”
The committee did not vote on the bill, but the chair of the committee, Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, said the committee will take up the legislation again soon.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Two years ago, a first-come first-served process allowed one Florida group to hoover up every dollar of available funding for Nevada’s private school scholarship program, which led to a perceived budget shortfall and a contentious 12-hour legislative meeting.
Now, Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno is sponsoring a bill aimed at addressing the administrative issues that led to that hubbub.
Assembly Bill 441 does not affect the total funding amount for the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship program, better known as Opportunity Scholarships. The program and its funding have been a political battleground for Republicans and Democrats since being established in 2015.
AB441 would create a 30-day application period during which the scholarship-granting organizations would submit to the Department of Taxation their applications for accessing funds. The Department of Taxation would then approve applications based on a mandated order of priority: Students already receiving a scholarship are first, then siblings of returning students, and then everyone else.
What happened in 2023 was that one Florida-based organization, AAA Scholarship Foundation, claimed the entirety of the $6.66 million available, leaving nothing for the other organizations who had been counting on the money. That led Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to ask the Democratic-controlled  Interim Finance Committee for $3.2 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds for the scholarship program. When his request was denied, Lombardo accused the majority party of “forcibly removing hundreds of low-income students from their schools.”
https://nevadacurrent.com/2023/08/10/democrats-reject-lombardos-3-2m-funding-request-for-private-school-scholarships/
Democrats at the time called it a “manufactured crisis” fanned by a Republican governor who earlier that year had proposed a massive expansion of the scholarship program only to walk away from a contentious legislative session with enough funding to keep the program at its current level. 
According to the most recent annual report on Opportunity Scholarships, which covered scholarships for the 2023-24 academic year, AAA had given out $5.8 million to at least 957 students and was still awarding money in December 2023. Meanwhile, three organizations that had given out money the year prior gave out nothing.
Monroe-Moreno last week told lawmakers on the Assembly Revenue Committee, which advanced the bill, that AAA publicly vowed to help affected students but did not follow through.
She added that one organization told her that their students did not get funded by AAA.
AAA Scholarship Foundation CEO Kim Dyson declined the Nevada Current’s request for an interview but emailed press releases from after that 2023 meeting stating that the organization was opening a special application period for students who’d been affected.
Dyson in a letter of opposition to AB441 said that the organization “awarded scholarships to every eligible transferring student who applied with us.”
The Nevada Independent reported in September 2023 that 283 students applied to AAA for a scholarship during that application period. That was less than half the amount of the number private school voucher advocates had said would be affected by the IFC decision the prior month.
For the 2024 funds, the Department of Taxation considered all applications received on one set date (June 14, 2024) to be received at the same time. Then, the department prorated the available funds, resulting in each organization receiving 76% of what they requested.
Dyson in an email said the organization is “grateful” for that change.
AB441 would also require scholarship-granting organizations to expend the money they receive within 18 months, with any unspent money after that time period going back to the state.
Representatives from AAA testified to lawmakers in August 2023 that the organization had $13 million in reserves.
AAA on Monday confirmed to the Current  that the organization still has $13 million in reserves.
It’s unclear how much reserves funding the other scholarship-granting organizations have. In 2023, those organizations had about $5 million combined.
Dyson in a letter of opposition to AB441 argued that reserves ensure financial stability and that the organization has followed the 2017 guidance from the Nevada Department of Education and Nevada Treasurer’s Office.
“Unlike some other” scholarship-granting organizations, “we have never had to cancel scholarships for eligible returning students,” she wrote.

Around the U.S., about 90,000 tons of nuclear waste is stored at over 100 sites in 39 states, in a range of different structures and containers.
For decades, the nation has been trying to send it all to one secure location.
A 1987 federal law named Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, as a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste – but political and legal challenges led to construction delays. Work on the site had barely started before Congress ended the project’s funding altogether in 2011.
The 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. This renewed interest gives new urgency to the effort to find a place to put the waste.
In March 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments related to the effort to find a temporary storage location for the nation’s nuclear waste – a ruling is expected by late June. No matter the outcome, the decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will probably continue for many years to come.
I am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are generally two forms of significantly radioactive waste in the U.S.: waste from making nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and waste from generating electricity at nuclear power plants. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments.
 Waste from weapons manufacturing

Remnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called “defense waste,” will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. These canisters are 10 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter, weighing approximately 5,000 pounds when filled.
For now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and Savannah River, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. At Savannah River, some of the waste has already been processed with glass, but much of it remains untreated.
At both of those locations, some of the radioactive waste has already leaked into the soil beneath the tanks, though officials have said there is no danger to human health. Most of the current efforts to contain the waste focus on protecting the tanks from corrosion and cracking to prevent further leakage.
 Waste from electricity generation

The vast majority of nuclear waste in the U.S. is spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.
Before it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. These bundles of fuel rods are about 12 to 16 feet long and about 5 to 8 inches in diameter. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.
After about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant’s property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down.
After about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant’s property. These vaults have vents to ensure air flows past the canisters to continue cooling them.
As of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country.
Even reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant.

 The threat of water

One threat to these storage methods is corrosion.
Because they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water.
In the U.S., nine are within two miles of the ocean, which poses a particular threat to the waste containers. As waves break on the coastline, saltwater is sprayed into the air as particles. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it’s common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean.
At nuclear waste storage locations near the ocean, that salt spray can settle on the steel canisters. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans’ kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces.
In recent years, the U.S. Department of Energy has funded research, including my own, into the potential dangers of this type of corrosion. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. But a radioactive leak would require not only corrosion of the container but also of the zirconium rods and of the fuel inside them. So it is unlikely that this type of corrosion would result in the release of radioactivity.
 A long way off

A more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away.
Not only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is.
Perhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the waste will stay where it is.

Photo illustration by Getty Images.Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.

Kennedy Jr. attended funeral services April 6 for Daisy Hildebrand, 8, the second Texas child to die from the measles this year.

A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.
Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The Republican Senate supermajority spent nearly four hours beating back attempts to amend the state’s two-year budget on Monday ahead of a key deadline, mostly spurning ideas from their Democratic colleagues.
The body opted to accept just three changes to House Bill 1001, including one to clarify that the Midwest Continental Divide Commission would get $4 million over the biennium — and not $2 million — and another reviving a specialty license plate. 
But another 60-plus amendments, mostly from the chamber’s 10-member Democratic caucus, were rejected. 
Sen. Andrea Hunley, still emotional after getting her amendment to require doula reimbursement defeated without discussion, decried lack of support for Democratic motions related to health care. 
“Those aren’t partisan issues. At least, they shouldn’t be. But not a single one was accepted — at least not yet. I’m going to be optimistic,” said Hunley, D-Indianapolis. “Our state’s budget is intended to be a reflection of our values in our state … (and) our Hoosiers deserve better than a chorus of ‘no,’ ‘no,’ no.’”
 Saying ‘no’ to Democrats…

At various points, Democrats tried to increase funding for subsidized child care and tuition support. 
One such amendment from Sen. Fady Qaddoura separated curricular materials from the overall formula — funding them at $244 million rather than $160 million — while another boosted complexity funding to support impoverished students. 
Qaddoura’s motions, like others, were quashed with little discussion. 
Republicans also rejected Democratic amendments to raise funds through cigarette, alcohol or gaming taxes, sometimes known as sin taxes.

Speaking on cigarette taxes, Sen. Ryan Mishler said that he wanted to “keep all options open,” but wished to wait until the revenue forecast slated for Wednesday before implementing a tax increase. 
Mishler, R-Mishawaka, is the Senate sponsor for House Bill 1001 and chief budget architect for Senate Republicans. 
“We may not have a full budget forecast but we already know … it’s going to be very, very tight,” countered Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington. 
Public health advocates have long sought an increase to the cigarette tax in Indiana, which has one of the lowest taxation rates in the region. But senators have repeatedly batted away such increases even after House lawmakers advanced them in back-to-back budget cycles. 
In a perennial effort, one suggestion sought to create a pathway for legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes, arguing that it would reduce the legal burden imposed on courts for minor possession, provide veterans and other first responders with requested medicinal relief and bring much-needed revenue to the state. 
Many Hoosiers, said Sen. Rodney Pol, already cross into Illinois, Michigan and Ohio to legally purchase cannabis. The majority of Hoosiers support legalizing marijuana to a certain extent, according to public policy polling. 
“This is a conversation that we just keep avoiding and it’s just inevitable,” said Pol, D-Chesterton.
The amendment, like the ones proposing sin tax increases, was defeated on a voice vote. 
 … and rejecting Republican ideas

Even ideas that had previously passed the chamber were voted down by Republicans when suggested by Democrats, including an effort that would have established a newborn tax credit. 
“Raising a child is incredibly costly, especially as the cost of living continues to rise and more families struggle to make ends meet,” said Pol. “Parents are stretching their budgets to afford diapers, secure reliable child care and care for their own mental health.” 
  Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, introduces an amendment to the budget on April 14, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
A bill from Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, to create just that passed out of the chamber unanimously in February but died in the House without a hearing. No Republican spoke on the amendment to say why it was defeated on Monday. 
And while the House version of the budget struck a tax on the period products, Senate budget writers nixed that proposal.
“These are very necessary products,” said Hunley. “What I’m really asking us to do is stay in alignment with what our bipartisan friends in the House did.”
The sole Republican to speak on the amendment, Sen. Liz Brown, compared purchasing period products to other expenses for children, such as sports equipment. 
“That becomes an essential item in your budget. Whether it’s a new pair of sneakers, making sure your kid has soccer cleats, making sure you can pay for a jersey — whatever it is. All those items that you purchase become essential,” said Brown, R-Fort Wayne. 
Hunley’s amendment, which also exempted the sales tax on adult diapers, and Yoder’s amendment on just period products were both rejected. 
Even Gov. Mike Braun’s ideas didn’t get the greenlight from Senate Republicans. 
Qaddoura introduced a measure that would have created a school tax holiday for student supplies. However, Mishler pointed to concerns from retailers around implementing it as well as concerns about potential future expansions.
Senate Republicans split with House GOP on education in latest budget

One Republican senator who does not caucus with the GOP also had his proposals defeated, though some colleagues broke ranks with the supermajority to support his ideas. 
Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, introduced four separate efforts that were all rejected, including the expansion of the homestead exemption for senior citizens and requiring the Senate wait 24 hours after a conference committee report on the budget before calling a concurrence vote. 
On the latter, he pointed to the 2023 budget vote, when a last-minute adjustment to school runs upended a seemingly routine process — meaning that a newly written budget was published just a few hours before the final vote.  
“That’s not fair. It’s not fair to us; it’s not fair to our constituents that we don’t have enough time to read and understand what’s in the most important bill we pass,” said Young. 
Though a general practice, the Senate doesn’t have a firm rule. Citing that tradition, Mishler asked for the amendment to be rejected. 
A full vote on the budget is expected in the Senate Tuesday but the spending plan will likely change following the forecast revenue on Wednesday.

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems, and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy, and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits, and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting, and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing, and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
 ‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about what the loss in funds will mean for their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation.
A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black, and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
 Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark lawrequiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Getty Images)As the CEO of Kem Krest, a mid-sized company with a deeply rooted employee-first culture, I’ve always believed that caring for our associates means going beyond competitive wages and traditional benefits. For years, like many American businesses, we’ve struggled with the rising costs of health care and the challenge of offering meaningful, affordable benefits.
We appreciate that this has been a top priority for state policymakers for many years. As a business, we are always looking for ways to reduce unnecessary spending, and a direct-to-employer partnership with our local hospital presented the perfect opportunity to cut out waste and reinvest into our most valuable asset – our employees.
Originally to manage costs, we implemented high-deductible health plans paired with wellness programs that offered cash incentives for participation. But over time, the data told us a different story: those incentives mostly benefited employees who were already healthy. Meanwhile, many others avoided seeking care unless it was catastrophic — discouraged by high out-of-pocket costs. We realized this approach wasn’t just ineffective; it was inconsistent with our values of putting associates, their families, and their health first.
My perspective began to shift even further during my time serving on the Board of Beacon Health System. Though I’m not a medical professional, this role opened my eyes to the critical role community hospitals play, not just in delivering care, but in shaping the overall health of the communities they serve.
How to help employees
We surveyed our team and confirmed what many employers are also discovering: health care and childcare are the two biggest challenges facing working families. While exploring solutions, we learned a surprising insight: Many of our associates weren’t seeing a primary care doctor at all. Most prioritized their children’s health care needs and would visit the ER only if absolutely necessary. That reframed the question for us. Instead of asking, “Is an on-site clinic feasible?” we asked, “What’s the right thing to do?”
And the answer was clear: bring accessible, high-quality care directly to our people — on-site and at no cost to them or their families.
Initially, we considered doing it ourselves. But we quickly realized that to do it right, we needed more than just a doctor. We needed infrastructure, equipment, IT systems, compliance protocols, and most importantly, employee trust. That’s where Beacon came in.
In partnership with Beacon, we launched our on-site clinic that features a private entrance and the look and feel of a traditional doctor’s office. Beacon provided the clinical staff, scheduling systems, electronic records, and the medical equipment.
As usage grew, we identified another opportunity: prescription costs. Employees paid the same co-pay regardless of pharmacy pricing, while the company absorbed wide variations in drug costs. So we expanded our clinic to include free prescription medications for the most common conditions. This not only reduced our overall spend but also created a powerful incentive for employees to seek care early.
Real results
The results have been extraordinary.
In 2024, our Indiana clinic saw over 500 visits, ranging from routine checkups and labs to chronic condition management and mental health services. Associates who hadn’t seen a doctor in years came in for physicals and women’s health screenings. Most meaningfully, we know of at least three lives saved through early detection of heart disease and cancer — conditions that could have been fatal if left undiagnosed.
In 2024 alone, Kem Krest has saved more than $800,000 in total health care expenses, and for the first time in years, we’ve seen flat to declining insurance premiums. The clinic has also become a standout advantage in both recruiting and retention.
Encouraged by the success of our Elkhart, Indiana site, we’ve expanded our clinics to our Wisconsin and Michigan facilities, with plans to open another in Carmel, Indiana by 2027.
What we’ve done at Kem Krest wouldn’t have been possible without the visionary partnership of Beacon Health, a community hospital system dedicated to improving lives — not just treating illness.
As state lawmakers navigate the complexities of our current health care system, I implore them to encourage innovative, market-based solutions that demonstrate real results, as they have for us at Kem Krest, instead of more government regulation. Employers have the tools they need to implement these types of partnerships, which lower costs across the board while improving health care quality, access, and value for employees.
Real commitment means making bold, values-based investments—even when they’re unconventional. We’re proud to be part of that movement.

Of the 96 microbusiness licenses issued by the state through a lottery since the program’s inception in 2023, regulators have revoked 34. 
Two were revoked for having a disqualifying felony offense on the owners’ record. The rest were for failing to show that the microbusiness licenses would be majority owned and operated by eligible individuals, according to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation. 
For more than a year, The Independent has documented the pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limited their profit and control of the business. Nearly all of the 32 licenses that have been revoked for ownership issues followed this pattern.
New rules target middlemen in Missouri cannabis industry to prevent ‘predatory’ practices

In December, the division announced new proposed rules for the marijuana microbusiness program designed to combat predatory practices during the application process. 
“These revisions are intended to ensure microbusiness licenses are issued to eligible individuals… and to address the trend of predatory arrangements in microbusiness licensing,” the division said in a December press release announcing the proposed changes. “Specifically, these draft rule revisions should mitigate the ongoing efforts of ineligible entities to acquire licenses by taking advantage of eligible individuals.”
The first nine revocations occurred last year, following the state’s first lottery for licenses in 2023.
The latest 25 revocations came on Monday, marking the end of a six-month investigation into some of the licenses that were selected out of the second lottery and awarded in July.
The revocations took effect on April 14.
Cannabis investor Michael Halow is connected to 22 awarded licenses the state has now revoked, including 16 revoked on Monday. In the sixteen notices of revocation sent in October, the division stated the licensee entered into an agreement that would result in someone besides the eligible applicant “becoming an owner of this and 15 other microbusiness licenses.”
In an email to The Independent Monday, Halow said he “respectfully disagrees” with the division’s decision and he plans to appeal. 
“We provide assistance to marijuana dispensary applicants who need it most,” Halow stated. “These are often people without generational wealth or experience as an entrepreneur. They open businesses in neighborhoods in need of jobs and economic opportunity.” 
Halow is connected to more than 700 of the 3,600 applications submitted for Missouri’s lottery since the program began.
In total, groups flooding the lottery have made up about 1,400 of the 3,600 applications submitted since the program began, meaning they’ve represented about 40% of what’s gone into the lottery and come away with nearly 40% of the licenses.
“As for the criticism regarding ‘flooding the lottery,’ it’s important to recognize that more applicants is actually a sign of greater participation in a government program,” Halow told The Independent in October, “which is a positive outcome.”
Missouri cannabis microbusiness ‘mentor’ connected to licenses under state investigation 

Four licenses connected to cannabis investors and microbusiness mentors David Brodsky and Scott Wootton were also revoked Monday. 
In the letters of pending revocation sent in October, the division stated that their agreements included “false or misleading information.”
“The licensee entered into an agreement that transfers ownership and operational control to another entity,” the letters stated.
Separately, notices of investigation were issued involving the group’s other three licenses back in July, stating regulators wanted to ensure the businesses continue “to be majority owned and operated by eligible individuals.” The division has not yet responded regarding The Independent’s questions on the status of these licenses. 
Brodsky and Wootton declined to comment on the division’s Monday announcement.
Amy Moore, the division’s director, said in a town hall meeting in February that Missouri’s microbusiness cannabis program will never get off the ground if regulators are consistently forced to revoke licenses over concerns about unlawful predatory practices.
That’s why new rules must be put in place to root out these practices and ensure the program lives up to its promise, Moore said.

The delay in medical care left her permanently disabled.,"A woman who was suffering a stroke sued New Jersey after a state trooper mistook her failure to respond to commands as inebriation and arrested her instead of seeking medical help.A judge has rejected the state’s bid for a new trial after an Essex County jury handed down an $11.5 million verdict against a New Jersey State Police trooper who mistook a motorist’s stroke for inebriation and arrested her, delaying medical treatment so long she’s now permanently disabled.
In an order issued Friday, Superior Court Judge Thomas Vena also dismissed the state’s claim that jurors got it wrong and refused to set aside or modify their January verdict. He denied, too, the state’s request to reduce the judgment, which attorneys had argued was excessive.
“It does not clearly and convincingly appear to the Court that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law,” Vena wrote. “The Court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict that the jury reached and that no reasonable mind could disagree with the outcome.”
Cheryl Rhines of Jersey City was driving to work in October 2017 when she began feeling ill and pulled over to the shoulder of a highway in Newark, according to the lawsuit her mother later filed.
The responding state trooper, Jennifer Albuja, misinterpreted Rhines’ failure to respond to commands, communicate coherently, or stand upright as intoxication — even though Albuja found no smell or sign of substance use and Rhines had facial drooping and other signs of a stroke, was dressed in business attire at 8 a.m. on a weekday, and had no prior offenses, her lawsuit says.
Albuja failed to get Rhines treatment at a hospital 5 minutes away and instead searched her car and hauled her, handcuffed, to the state police’s Somerville station, delaying treatment by two and half hours, according to the complaint. A sergeant at the station finally called EMTs, but troopers still left Rhines shackled on the floor even after they determined she was in medical distress. Albuja had been a trooper for only two years when she arrested Rhines.
Rhines, now 56, had to leave her job as an event planner and move in with her mother in Nashville because she’s unable to speak or understand what people say to her — a language disorder called global aphasia that’s caused by stroke-related brain damage, her attorney, Dennis M. Donnelly, told the New Jersey Monitor in February.
Vena rejected all of the state’s arguments for reconsideration, including that jurors wrongly assessed damages for both emotional damages and pain and suffering, that the care Rhines’ mother gave her is not compensable, and that evidence of Rhines’ shackling was irrelevant and prejudicial.
“The Court permitted such testimony regarding the Plaintiff being shackled to provide the jury an accurate representation of the events that transpired before she was finally able to receive medical attention and that led to the basis of her complaint. Thus, a new trial is not warranted on this ground,” Vena wrote.
Before trial, the case went through mediation, but the state’s attorneys refused to resolve the case for more than $1 million — and Rhines’ care expenses had exceeded that, Donnelly said in February.
Jurors initially returned a $19.1 million verdict after a nearly month-long trial to cover Rhines’ future medical care, emotional distress, pain and suffering, and loss of income. But they blamed 60% of Rhines’ disabilities on the delayed treatment and 40% on the stroke itself, which the trooper didn’t cause. So they reduced their initial award by 40%.
Vena reminded the state several times in his ruling of that reduction, writing: “This ended up being advantageous for the Defendants.”
Donnelly could not be reached for comment Monday. Attorney William J. Hamilton, who represents the state and Albuja, declined to comment.
The judgment, which now stands at $11.2 million after some tweaking to reflect Rhines’ medical expenses and insurance benefits, is unusually high for lawsuits filed against the state. In 2023, when the state paid out $121 million to settle 364 claims, only 23 resulted in payouts of over $1 million, according to a recent New Jersey Monitor analysis.

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images) The public is encouraged to save the date of the dedication of the new Idaho Women Veterans Memorial, which will now be located at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery in Boise.
The memorial, which was originally planned to be located at the Idaho Veterans Garden in Caldwell, will now have a permanent space at the veterans cemetery, the Idaho Veterans Garden, in partnership with the Idaho Division of Veterans Services, announced in a press release Monday.
The dedication of the memorial will be at 11 a.m. Sept. 5 at the cemetery at 10100 N. Horseshoe Bend Road in Ada County.
“This important decision to relocate the memorial was made with careful consideration, ensuring that it will receive the permanent care it deserves while remaining accessible and visible to all who feel the impact of this profound loss across our state,” the Idaho Division of Veterans Services said in a press release.
The memorial will honor Cpl. Carrie L. French, Idaho’s first woman killed in combat, as well as the contributions of all Idaho women who have bravely served in the military. French was killed June 5, 2005, during the Iraq War when an improvised explosive device, or IED, hit the front of her convoy vehicle and detonated in Kirkuk, Iraq, the Idaho Statesman reported.
“Carrie exemplifies the spirit of camaraderie that flourishes among all veterans — women and men alike — during their service,” the Idaho Division of Veterans Services said in the release. “The memorial will be lovingly maintained and will play a significant centerpiece in the many ceremonies and traditions held at the cemetery each year. Although Carrie rests in her hometown of Caldwell, her legacy as a distinguished service member will be eternally celebrated at the State Veterans Cemetery in Boise.”
Danny Pugmire, from the Idaho Veterans Garden and the founder of the Idaho Women Veterans Memorial, said in the release that the hope is that the memorial will serve as a place of remembrance and reflection for future generations.
“The new location will offer a place for everyone, friends and family to truly honor Carrie and while maintaining the dignity and respect that the memorial deserves,” Pugmire said. 
Jake Faulkner, the director of the veterans cemetery, said locating the memorial at the cemetery is “a privilege and a solemn responsibility that we will embrace with reverence.”
“This memorial stands as a lasting testament to the service and sacrifice of Idaho’s women veterans,” Faulkner said in the release. “It will be thoughtfully maintained and integrated into the cemetery’s traditions, providing a place of reflection, gratitude and remembrance for all who visit.”
The dedication ceremony will include addresses from the memorial’s sculptor and world-renowned artist, Benjamin Victor, Faulkner, Pugmire, and Marisa McCarter, author of the story “Marbles,” which captures McCarter’s friendship and service with French.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Oil and gas drilling is a dirty business and has a serious impact on our wildlands and communities.
It involves the use and release of numerous toxic chemicals that enter the environment via several pathways: drilling, hydraulic fracturing, waste pits, spills, and releases to air.
With oil and gas long being a lifeblood of our economy, it’s not surprising that according to a study published in Environmental Health Perspectives, roughly half of all Oklahomans live within a mile of an active well. But I suspect untold numbers likely live in proximity to orphaned wells. Those are the wells that have been abandoned by companies, without regard to best practices required to shutter them to ensure public safety.
After oil and gas wells are done producing, they must be properly closed to prevent air and water pollution, protect the health of the surrounding communities, restore the property values of the landowner, and in particular, prevent high-priority, climate-forcing methane emissions.
Methane is the second leading greenhouse gas causing global warming after carbon dioxide. And, because it’s often paired with other toxic pollutants, the release of methane into the air can cause debilitating health problems for the millions of people who live near oil and gas operations.
Oklahoma has more than 260,000 unplugged wells, 20,000 of which are “orphan” or abandoned wells.
Based on the number of previously unknown wells that have been found since the start of this century, the actual number is almost undoubtedly appreciably higher, as no records were submitted for many wells drilled in the early 20th century and locations given for documented wells from that time period were often extremely inaccurate.
Until properly plugged, oil and gas wells, besides emitting methane, pose additional environmental and health hazards, including allowing oil, gas and other toxic chemicals, such as arsenic, benzene, and hydrogen sulfide, to seep into the soil and groundwater, contaminating drinking water sources and ecosystems.
Contaminated soil, small oil spills and other surface waste along with old equipment can still be present at orphaned well sites. In some poorly plugged or unplugged wells, gas, salty water, oil, or drilling mud can spill out from the well onto the ground surface potentially harming livestock and other animals.
Estimates show it could cost approximately $7.3 billion to plug and clean up the state’s wells. In contrast, our state coffers have just $45 million worth of bonds. In theory, cleanup is supposed to be guaranteed by bonds that companies fund.
The public’s rightful expectation is that oil and gas operators should be contributing enough in bonds up front to guarantee the financial responsibilities related to well abandonment. Sufficient bonding creates an incentive for companies to plug their own wells: Once the work is completed, the company gets its bond back.
However, as made evident in a May 5, 2024, Propublica story, because of Oklahoma’s lenient bonding requirements and loopholes in existing statutes and rules, there is little to deter wells from being abandoned by those who have no intent to be a legitimate oil and gas operator. Those operators often form shell companies under false ownership names, strip existing wells and sell the salvaged material. The “operator” then goes out of business, abandoning the wells and leaving the responsibility for cleanup to the state.
This situation provided Oklahoma lawmakers with the impetus to overhaul bonding requirements for oil and gas producers with House Bill 1369. This bill, which has advanced to the Senate, would create tiers for amounts paid to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission based on the number of wells owned by an operator.
The Corporation Commission also uses money from an excise tax on oil and gas producers to plug wells with no known owner in Oklahoma. With this in mind, House Bill 1370 would increase the percentage of money flowing to the fund from fossil fuel production. That measure also cleared the state House and awaits consideration in the Senate.
The Oklahoma Energy Resources Board, a state agency funded voluntarily by Oklahoma’s oil and natural gas producers and royalty owners, also focuses on environmental restoration of abandoned well sites. Since the levy’s inception it has funded the restoration of more than 20,000 sites. But as another Propublica investigation reported, some of Oklahoma’s biggest oil companies — 76 in all over the past seven years — have opted out of the fund, forcing the state to refund millions of dollars that would have otherwise gone toward restoring an additional 1,500 orphan well sites.
A final revenue source for plugging wells was supposed to be federal funding available through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Currently, however, that funding is on hold due to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump which halted the disbursement of unspent funds.
Trump’s directive seeks to support the fossil fuel industry and discourage renewable energy policies and projects in the United States.
Should these federal dollars be permanently withheld, the already slow progress of plugging wells in Oklahoma could become collateral damage.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)On the cusp of key legislative deadlines, GOP-led regulations for a marijuana-like drug got more edits Monday — despite vocal opposition from fellow Indiana House Republicans.
Legislation cracking down on homelessness and diversity initiatives, plus promoting high-speed internet access, also passed muster. They return to the Senate for consent to the House’s changes, or to kick off negotiations.
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly.
After third committee vote, delta-8 regulations head to House floor

Senate Bill 478 has gotten further than its predecessors, but its journey hasn’t been smooth. It has been revised at every opportunity possible: during two Senate committee hearings, on the Senate’s floor, in each of a whopping three House committee hearings and, Monday, it was the subject of 17 wide-ranging amendments filed for discussion on the House floor.
The measure sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements. It authorizes the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission to regulate.
Provisions defining “craft hemp flower products” and setting out high milligram limits have sparked opposition from Indiana’s chief attorney and others, but weren’t changed Monday. Instead, lawmakers took up just two of the amendments.
One, removing a new tax that was only partially removed last week, was adopted easily. Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, reminded his colleagues that new taxes must go in House bills.

But the other, raising the cap on retail permits from 9,400 to 20,000 and allowing permits for convenience and drug stores, prompted blowback from Teshka’s own caucus. 
House Speaker Todd Huston presided over a first, then a second voice vote, but both sides were just as loud. Representatives from both caucuses counted up supporters and opponents instead: it was accepted on a vote of 63-21.
Other complaints weren’t addressed.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office wrote that the legislation “expands” a loophole for “high-potency, intoxicating THC products under the guise of hemp,” in a letter to lawmakers. The missive — signed by Legislative Director Erin Tuttle — was included in a Monday morning alert from the American Family Association’s Indiana chapter.
A 2018 federal law defined legal hemp as containing 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight or less, but the letter observes lawmakers didn’t apply that limit to other isomers. Only “very high” caps of 100 milligrams per serving and 3,000 milligrams per package would apply.
The legislation also allows THC potency to be measured by weight or volume — without limits on the product’s size or mass — instead of by dry weight, Rokita’s office continued.
That means manufacturers can increase the milligrams by “manipulating a product’s volume.”
“By allowing these products to be sold, SB 478 effectively creates a parallel cannabis market in Indiana — one that operates entirely outside the state’s marijuana laws at a time when marijuana remains illegal at both the state and federal levels,” the letter said.

It urged lawmakers to instead consider any product containing more than 0.3% total THC by dry weight as banned marijuana.
Homelessness measure divides GOP
House Democrats also spent about an hour apiece attacking proposals they maintain criminalize homelessness and undo progress born out the Civil Rights Movement.
Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, said Senate Bill 197 is “not about punishing people for being homeless.”
“We are never going to arrest or jail our way out of this problem,” said Ireland, the bill’s sponsor in the House. He said the goal is to keep public spaces “accessible and clean, while offering individuals every reasonable opportunity to access the services and the shelter they so desperately need.”
The bill stipulates that “a person may not camp, sleep, or use for long term shelter a public right-of-way or public land unless authorized for that use by the state or political subdivision, as appropriate.”
Before they can make an arrest, officers must first determine “if there are reasonable grounds for an emergency detention of the person.” If not, they must warn the person to leave within the 24- or 72-hour timeframe and offer transportation to a shelter or other form of “temporary accommodations that provide respite and offer access to services and permanent housing options,” within five miles, as long as one exists and has a spot available. If the person refuses or there’s no space, officers must call a local crisis intervention team, if there is one. 
Those who have not moved from a public right-of-way within 24 hours of a law enforcement officer’s warning — or from public land within 72 hours — could be arrested and charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail or a $500 fine. Legal proceedings would be referred to a problem-solving court.
“This is a bill grounded in principle,” Ireland told the House.

“It defends the rule of law, respects property rights, brings compassion to public safety, ensures fairness before fines, offers help before punishment, restores dignity through due process,” he added.
Democrats remained staunchly opposed.
“This is not a compassionate bill. This is a cruelty bill,” Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, said in response to Ireland’s assertion it represents a “compassionate response.”
“If you don’t abide by these rules, then you are going to be criminalized and penalized, and you might have a record simply because you don’t have a place to lay your head,” Pryor said.
Her colleagues also criticized the process.
Rep. Maureen Bauer noted there was no testimony taken when a House committee co-opted a building safety bill to revive homelessness language from a dead bill. 
“It wasn’t vetted properly before the public,” said Bauer, D-South Bend. “… And it adds a new criminal penalty without ever going to (the) Courts and Criminal Code (Committee). If this was about connecting people to services, there would be no criminal penalty.”
The House approved Senate Bill 197 in a 52-40 vote — a narrow margin featuring more than a dozen Republican defections.
Diversity bill debated
Legislation outlawing “discrimination” in state education, employment and licensing “based on a personal characteristic of the person” advanced in a 67-27 vote along party lines.
Senate Bill 289 sponsor Rep. Chris Jeter said “discriminatory” programs have “crept their way into our government institutions” and created “division.”
“This current version of this bill avoids legislating words because words can be manipulated; words can
be weaponized,” Jeter, R-Fishers, said. “This bill instead focuses on actions and behaviors.”
It would also allow Rokita, the attorney general, to impose hefty civil penalties for violations: $50,000 for a first offense and $100,000 for a second or subsequent offense.

But Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary, said pro-diversity policies came into existence for a reason. In a lengthy speech from the House floor, he recalled how his mother faced racist attacks when forced into an attempt to integrate the former Emerson High School.
She and the other Black honors students “were called all kinds of names. They were pushed, they were spit on,” he said. The white teachers refused to let them enter their classrooms, locking the doors instead, while the white students walked out.
Smith further described how he himself wasn’t allowed to eat at certain restaurants, go to certain events or enter certain parts of the city in his younger years. As a 12-year-old, he got off at the wrong bus stop and “got stoned by white children because I was not supposed to be in that neighborhood.”
“I never thought, when I was fighting (in) the Civil Rights Movement, that we would be reversing ourselves in this country,” Smith said.
Senate Bill 289 could also create a “serious problem” for the South Bend Community School Corp., per Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend. He feared the district could be on the hook for damages.
“I believe (it’s) the last school corporation in the state that’s under a (federal) desegregation consent decree,” Dvorak said. It requires each school to mirror the district’s overall Black student population.
Jeter said that federal law reigns supreme in conflicts with state statutes.

Other Democrats said the changes would harm veterans. Jeter said they wouldn’t.
The House also unanimously approved legislation offering a compromise between electricity and telecommunications providers in a bid to speed up the buildout of high-speed internet in rural and other underserved areas throughout Indiana.

[…]","Children outside with a child care teacher at The Playing Field, a Madison child care center that participates in the federal Head Start program. (Courtesy of The Playing Field)A news report that the Trump administration is considering ending the federal government’s Head Start program has alarmed providers and parents who rely on the child care and early education program.
“It would be absolutely devastating,” said Jen Bailey, executive director of Reach Dane, which operates 14 Head Start centers in Dane and Green counties. “The children and families we work with are some of the most vulnerable folks in our communities. The parents in those communities rely on the care we provide to stay employed.”
USA Today reported Friday that the Trump administration “is considering a budget proposal that would zero out funding for Head Start.” The news report quoted an anonymous administration official who said the White House funding blueprint for the 2026 fiscal year doesn’t allocate money for Head Start.
Responding to the report Monday, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) tied the proposal to President Donald Trump’s goal of extending the 2017 tax cuts enacted in his first term.
“Shutting down Head Start — taking care away from kids, firing teachers, and making child care even more expensive for parents — all so President Trump can hand out new tax breaks for the wealthy and well-connected is flat out wrong and you can be sure I will fight this proposal at every turn,” Baldwin said.
Head Start was founded in 1966, part of the War on Poverty undertaken by President Lyndon Johnson. It provides child care and preschool for families with incomes up to the federal poverty guideline. Children living in foster homes are also eligible for Head Start.
In Wisconsin more than 15,000 children are enrolled in more than 300 Head Start child care centers across the state, according to the Wisconsin Head Start Association. With more than 4,300 employees, Head Start ranks in the top 100 employers in Wisconsin, said Jennie Mauer, the association’s executive director.
“At least 70% of our families have a parent who is either working or in school full time,” Mauer said Monday. The remaining families include grandparents who are retired but full-time caregivers for their grandchildren as well as families unable to work due to disabilities or who “are working through some very, very significant challenges.”
She predicted that the impact from ending the program wouldn’t stop with the families who rely on Head Start.
“If Head Start isn’t there, if this program were to shut down, surely there’ll be tremendous cascading economic impacts in our communities,”  Mauer said. “I think for most of the families, it would create a huge labor disruption. With no safe place to have your kids while you’re at work, it’ll create a disaster.
Child care already a crisis
Fears for the survival of Head Start are escalating as the state’s overall child care sector is increasingly under strain. As many as 25% of child care centers in a survey released April 10 said they could close without continuing support in the next state budget.
April Mullins-Datko is Head Start director for ADVOCAP, a social service agency serving Fond du Lac, Winnebago and Green Lake counties. She said that the agency’s four Head Start centers would likely not survive the loss of federal support.
“We would lose services for the 202 children we serve,” Mullins-Datko said. “It would exacerbate the child care crisis we have in our communities, which then has negative impacts on our available workforce.”










I think for most of the families, it would create a huge labor disruption. With no safe place to have your kids while you're at work, it'll create a disaster.


– Jennie Mauer, Wisconsin Head Start Association executive director


ADVOCAP’s centers include three in Fond du Lac County and one in Green Lake County, with 193 families relying on the program for the care and early education of their children.
“Ninety-three percent of my families are working or going to school full time,” Mullins-Datko said.
The agency’s Head Start federal contract is supposed to be good through Dec. 31, 2028, Mullins-Datko said, but with reports of defunding she fears that won’t be honored: “There just doesn’t seem to be any kind of adherence to law and contracts.”
Western Dairyland Economic Opportunity Council provides social services in Buffalo, Jackson, Trempealeau and Eau Claire counties in West Central Wisconsin. The agency’s programs include nine Head Start centers enrolling 442 children. Of those, 382 children are in preschool and 60 are in Early Head Start, for children from birth to age 3, said Thanh Bui-Duquette, Western Dairyland’s Head Start director.
Three centers are in cities — two in Eau Claire and one in Altoona — but the rest are in rural communities.
“We meet the needs of each individual community,” Bui-Duquette said. “The needs of the urban Eau Claire area look very different from rural Trempealeau County.”
Even with jobs, 96% of the families with children in Western Dairyland’s program have incomes below the federal poverty guideline. For children from those families, she said, Head Start has been demonstrated to improve long-term outcomes — increasing the chances of graduating from high school and going on to higher education, and reducing the chances of ending up in the criminal justice system.
“It’s important to have that solid foundation early on, especially for children from disadvantaged families,” Bui-Duquette said.
Payments delayed, offices closed
The news that Head Start is in the crosshairs of budget-writers in the Trump administration follows other jolts to the program in the last two months.
In late January and early February, Head Start operators reported widespread problems in their efforts to collect standard payments from the federal government. Under Head Start contracts, programs incur an expense then submit documentation through a federal online portal to get reimbursed. Head Start programs reported that payments stalled, for nearly two weeks in some cases, without explanation.
Payments have since resumed, but Mauer said directors are reporting demands for more information holding up payments.
“They’re getting substantial delays for things that are accepted expenses, which is concerning,” she said.
On April 1, Head Start operators learned that the program’s five regional offices across the country were closed without any advance notice, including the Chicago office that serves Wisconsin and five other states in the Upper Midwest.
Those events and the report that the program could be defunded have rattled Head Start employees and the parents who have counted on the program, operators say.
“Families and staff are both really scared and concerned,” said Bailey, the Reach Dane director. “Families are reaching out, worried the program is going to close, asking, ‘Is my child still going to be able to go to school?’”
Reach Dane’s human resources staff has been interviewing applicants for teaching jobs in the coming school year, and applicants are nervous about whether the job will exist, she added.
Bailey said the program is trying to be transparent with employees and families about the uncertainty and fight for the program’s survival, all without sparking panic.
“Trying to figure out how to navigate and inform folks when there’s no communication is a hard place to be,” she said.

Fisher said that “having a brother who is now incarcerated for a situation that happened in Green Bay, that was pretty tough for me. And I know what type of trauma I experienced from that. I had a brother who was shot here on the west side of Green Bay, about 11 years ago. And so, I remember getting those calls, and having to deal with those emotions, and what that felt like.”
He said other family members have been shot. ”I also have lost a lot of friends due to gun violence,” said Fisher. “And just recently, two years ago, I lost my uncle, one of my only uncles, due to gun violence.” 
Fisher is a violence interrupter at the Office of Violence Prevention, where he builds relationships with community members and tries to prevent violence before it happens. 
The office listens to “rumblings in the community,” Fisher said. When they hear something from social media or word of mouth, it’s their job to put out the fire. 
Fisher said he’s been in the community for a long time and worked for the Green Bay Area Public School District. He said his relationships and people’s respect for him enable him “to intervene in those situations and start conversations.”
“And then if they’re open [to it], I try to either meet with them or bring them into the space,” he said. “That’s why it’s critical to have a home base.”
Green Bay’s Office of Violence Prevention was formed in 2023 after the city was awarded a grant from the Medical College of Wisconsin. On Monday, the office held the grand opening of its new location on the east side of Green Bay. 
Director Andrea Kressin described it as a safe space where relationship building and coaching can happen. This is important for the office’s prevention work to support people who are at the highest risk of engaging in violence or deter them from engaging in further violence, she said.
Police officers operated at the office’s old location, and high-risk individuals might not have a good relationship with police, Fisher said. 
“We kind of take them out of their environment, and bring them in a calm, safe space where we can then use our CBT [cognitive behavioral therapy] strategies to kind of help them rewire the way they think,” Fisher said. 
In its 2023 crime report, the Green Bay Police Department reported six homicides and a 17% decrease in assault offenses, which included gun violence.
In its 2024 crime report, the department reported four fewer homicides, but also reported a rise in crimes against persons of around 18%. Some of the offenses that led to the increase included aggravated assault, simple assault and kidnapping/abduction. 
The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform partnered with Green Bay Police and other local community corrections agencies to study shootings and homicides in Green Bay between 2019 and 2021. The analysis found that in Green Bay “most gun violence is tightly concentrated on a small number of very high risk young Black male adults that share a common set of risk factors.” 
These risk factors included involvement in street crews/groups and significant criminal justice history, according to the analysis. The analysis found that shootings were often caused by a “petty conflict over a young woman, a simple argument, or a feud on social media.” People involved in groups or gangs were also involved in a range of other criminal activities, such as selling drugs or robbery, which made them more likely to be involved in violence. 
One of the report’s recommendations was that the city of Green Bay should invest in development and expansion of community-based violence intervention services.
Kressin said the Office of Violence Prevention has played a part in contributing to a short-term reduction in the number of homicides as well as shots-fired incidents in the community. 
When a violent incident happens and has the potential to lead to retaliation in the community, a primary role of the office is to intervene, Kressin said. She also said the office has built partnerships with community organizations, participated in community events, hosted community conversations in Spanish and English and knocked on doors. 
Fisher said the Green Bay Police Department shares information with the Office of Violence Prevention. The department can give information to Kressin, and the office can make a plan to get involved. The goal is to minimize and defuse a situation so they don’t have to contact the police, but the office will contact the police to avoid someone getting hurt, Fisher said. 
The new location includes a recording studio, lending library, video production tools and interactive workshops aimed at building life skills in collaboration with community organizations, the office said in a statement. 
Kressin said participants can learn about music production and build relationships with violence interrupters. One of the interrupters is working with podcasting and videography, and the Office of Violence Prevention is getting started with the rollout, she said. 
Green Bay Police Chief Chris Davis was one of the speakers at the grand opening’s press conference. 
“Our police officers in our organization have been able to make some really great relationships, and a lot of us, myself included, have been able to see tangible results in real people’s lives as a result of that work together,” Davis said. “And so we’re looking forward to what the future holds for this program and for this community.”

Today is Tax Day – the day the political right – lazily and predictably – likes to use as a crutch for blasting government.
What all of us would do well to recall today, however, is where we would be without taxes and the essential services they provide that make civilized society possible.
And we should also remember two huge failings of the North Carolina tax system that are the handiwork of political conservatives:
First, is the regressive nature of our state tax structure – a system in which the wealthy pay vastly lower rates than people of middle and lower incomes.
And second, is the way that repeated regressive tax cuts of the past 15 years are starving core public services – so much so that total spending on things like schools and infrastructure in North Carolina has plunged by nearly 40%.
The bottom line: No one loves paying taxes, and our system is far from perfect, but when Americans buy into lazy and simplistic anti-tax narratives, average people play right into the hands of the wealthy forces who’ve been rigging the system.

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/15/nonprofits-report-calls-for-broad-based-approach-to-improving-reading-scores/,"Consistent funding for teachers' programs is just one of the recommendations in a report out Tuesday morning from Maryland READS, a nonprofit focused on improved reading instruction, but it says there are nonfinancial remedies as well.","Alex Arianna during a reading lesson at Lincoln Elementary School. (Photo courtesy Frederick County Public Schools)Alice Tickler tries to stay positive when it comes to educating young children, but the longtime teacher admits there are some things that can make it hard — and it’s not anything the students do.
Things like the legislature’s failure to fund a training program, specifically for reading and math teachers. As a teacher for 28 years, she’s seen the benefits of what educators call a “coaching program” can have.
“Seeing other teachers in action, having a mentor teacher that knows how to teach reading alongside of you or coaching you, that’s huge,” said Tickler, a first-grade teacher in Queen Anne’s County public schools. “That coaching model would really benefit teachers.”
Tickler’s comments echo recommendations in a report being released Tuesday morning by Maryland READS, a nonprofit focused on the improvement of reading instruction. Providing consistent funding for teachers is just one of the recommendations in “The State of Reading in Maryland 2025: It’s Time for a Comeback after a Decade of Decline.”
While the General Assembly approved the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act last week without funding for a training program, it did approve funding for a national teacher recruitment campaign and a $2,000 relocation grant to “incentivize an out-of-state licensed teacher to move to the state.”
The report’s not all about funding, however, and acknowledges the state’s financial difficulties. Similar to a report produced last year, Tuesday’s document outlines recommendations to improve literacy, such as businesses providing employees time to serve as local tutors, and state and local leaders organizing town halls on digital education for families.
Because of the state’s fiscal challenges, the report suggests philanthropists provide financial and other resources to help create “thriving, reading ecosystems.”
  A chart shows per pupil spending increased in comparison to test scores for fourth- and eighth-grade students in Maryland. (Chart courtesy of Maryland READS)
According to the report, per pupil spending increased by 37% since 2013 through last year. During that time, National Assessment of Educational Progress math scores have constantly declined.
“Everything the state has done to put a system of support in place … gives us hope,” Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS, said in an interview. “But I think the legislature needs to get on board a little bit more and trust her [State Superintendent Carey Wright] leadership because she has a proven track record, and I don’t think they did that this time around.”
‘Make sure children can read’
Tuesday’s document notes a report last year from the National Council on Teacher Quality. It gave Maryland and 19 other states an overall “moderate” rating on teacher training programs based on five policy actions to strengthen implementation of the “science of reading,” which Wright utilized as public schools leader in Mississippi and pushed to incorporate in Maryland.
The council gave three ratings – strong, moderate and weak – not only for the total assessment of training programs, but also separate reviews of each policy action. On the policy statement, “Reviews teacher-preparation programs to ensure they teach the Science of Reading,” Maryland received a “weak” rating.
Maryland READS recommends the state Department of Education “should immediately exercise authority, including limiting grants and contracts, and hold Maryland teacher preparation programs accountable for aligning to Science of Reading by 2028.”
According to the report, what will help teachers with literacy instruction is an agreement the department made last year to implement a four-year, $6.8 million grant from the nonprofit Ibis Group of Washington, D.C.
About $5.3 million of that grant will be used for free online training in the science of reading for at least 30,000 paraprofessionals, teachers and other staff. The remaining $1.5 million would be for Johns Hopkins University and the department to research the impact of teacher efficacy, teacher background knowledge and literacy.
But Brennan-Gac said additional and consistent support is needed.
“Having a coach in the classroom actually helps the teacher change their practice,” Brennan-Gac said. “While it’s wonderful that we’ve brought these training programs into the state, [but] if they don’t get the coaching, we’re not really leveraging that wonderful resource we have and this whole movement that we’re doing.”
Some other recommendations from the report to improve literacy include:

Starting July 1, the department should collaborate with educators and organizations to begin work on drafting an adolescent literacy policy;
The legislature should tie future funding to data related to proficiency rates at community schools, those that receive high concentration of poverty grants which provide a variety of wraparound and other services; and
State, local and community leaders should educate parents and guardians on limiting the use of electronic devices for their children.

“We should do everything that we can to make sure that our children can read,” said Tickler, who serves on a statewide teacher advisory council created by the department this year. “We don’t want our children to enter that pipeline that takes them to jail or drugs. We want our kids to be successful and we want our kids to be literate.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Teacher-with-look-sign-scaled-1-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-04-15 08:08:21.733591

(Photo: Alex Kent)A GOP bill giving law enforcement expanded arrest powers during public protests and police actions is drawing pushback from civil rights and journalist groups as a potential infringement on First Amendment rights. 
The multi-part bill (HB55/SB30) by Tennessee House Leader William Lamberth of Portland and Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon — both Republicans — would allow police to order members of the media and public to remain 25 feet away from crime scenes, traffic stops and any “ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.”
The proposed legislation would also give police added enforcement powers during public protests and demonstrations. 
The bill redefines the crime of “littering” to include the distribution of flyers with the “intent to to unlawfully intimidate,” criminalizes the hanging of banners and signs over bridges and tunnels and allows police to make misdemeanor arrests of protestors identified through social media videos. 
The bill additionally gives law enforcement the right to demand a person’s name based on “reasonable suspicion of a legal violation.”
In a letter to lawmakers Monday, more than two dozen groups representing Tennessee Muslim, Jewish, Black and immigrant groups, and civil liberties advocates, warned the legislation is “likely to have a chilling effect” on a spectrum of communities seeking to make their voices heard in response to public policy decisions. 
“We are living in a period in which constitutional rights and physical safety are at increased risk with federal workers, students, LGBTQ+ immigrant, Jewish, Muslim and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities caught in the crosshairs,” their letter noted.  The “real world impact” of the proposed legislation would infringe on the fundamental right of speech and assembly, the groups said. 










There’s a million-and-a-half reasons why reporters need to be in close proximity to law enforcement to do their own job. This gives police far too much discretion to shut that reporting down.


– Grayson Clary, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press


Media organizations have also opposed the legislation.
“As you can imagine, journalists appear within 25 feet of law enforcement officers doing their day job every day,” said Grayson Clary, staff attorney with Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides legal support to journalists. 
“Maybe it’s a crime scene, a protest, a police response to a rally when it takes a turn,” he said. “There’s a million-and-a-half reasons why reporters need to be in close proximity to law enforcement to do their own job. This gives police far too much discretion to shut that reporting down.”
Similar legislation in Indiana and Louisiana creating buffer zones between police and the public, including the media, have been preliminarily halted by federal courts, Clary noted. Both laws are currently in the federal appeals process. 
Pody told lawmakers last week that the intent of a 25-foot buffer line around police is not to keep the public from observing police actions, but to protect the work of law enforcement.
“They can still be witnessed. They can still be videotaped,” Pody said. “I think that law enforcement is not opposed to anything like that. We still want them to be held accountable…We’re just saying there’s a 25 foot radius if (police) are actively doing something where they need to be focused on the job.”
But Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat, noted that requiring the public to be 25 feet away could keep police actions out of view. She cited the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police – an event captured on bystander video.
“The flaw in this part (of Tennessee’s bill) is it doesn’t give citizens the ability to exercise their First Amendment right and catch that,” she said. “And it opens up the door to police misconduct, and it shields them from citizens having the evidence of police misconduct.”
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis cited “bridge bandits, intersection imbeciles and interstate insurrectionists” disrupting roadways in his district for his support of the bill.
In response to questions from Taylor, a Tennessee Highway Patrol attorney confirmed that, should the bill become law, protestors in Memphis who appear in social media images blocking roadways and bridges could be arrested by state troopers even if Memphis police declined to make arrests.

The bill’s origins lie with action taken by the Metro Nashville Council last year in response to several anti-semitic and racist demonstrations by white supremacist and neo-Nazis in downtown Nashville. 
The largely Democratic council voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing four ordinances aimed at hate speech and those who promote it, including buffer zones around public buildings, a ban on highway banners and a provision banning the transport of individuals in the back of a box truck —  the way some white supremacist protestors arrived in Nashville last summers. 
Tennessee Republicans, Nashville mayor back antisemitism bill

Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell and others in Metro government worked with Republicans to craft the current legislation and its backers have cited the need to stem a rise in anti-semitic demonstrations.
“While addressing anti-Semitism is a shared and important concern, these bills include sweeping provisions with dangerous and far-reaching consequences that compromise free speech, public safety, and the principles of equitable justice,” said Sabina Mohyuddin, executive director of the Nashville-based American Muslim Advisory Council, which opposes the bill along with Bend the Arc Jewish Action, Latino Memphis, Nashville Jews for Justice and the NAACP Nashville branch.
“In today’s political climate—where immigrant and pro-Palestinian voices are increasingly targeted—this legislation raises grave concerns,” she said.
The Tennessee Senate adopted the bill 30-2 Monday. In the House, the bill will be considered after debate over the state budget.

(Photo courtesy of Liz Cartwright)Of all the issues surrounding the Ukraine-Russia conflict, one really stands out for me — the thousands of children who have been abducted by Russian troops and sent to re-education camps and adoptive families all over Russia. There are currently 19,546 cases on file of abducted children. These children are being forcibly held in Russia, and they are not able to contact their families back in Ukraine.
I was in Washington, D.C., at the Ukraine Action Summit (April 6-9, 2025) as part of the Idaho Delegation, along with Lena and Scott Contor and Eric Medina. All 50 states were represented at the summit and over 600 individuals attended. Attendees were Ukrainians by birth, by ancestry and by choice; I’m one of the latter.

At its core, the purpose of the summit was informational, and the information coming out of some of the best universities in the U.S. points to a huge number of Ukrainian children who have been caught up in this conflict. 
According to the Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab,  “The February 2023 report found that more than 6,000 children between the ages of four months and 17 years had been transported to 43 Russian-operated camps and facilities since the launch of Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.”  Recent updates, using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data triangulated with social media posts and other open source information show that the abductions are continuing; a small percentage of the children have been located and returned while many others continue to disappear. 
Ukrainian children are held in several different situations after being abducted by Russian soldiers, according to Nathaniel Raymond of the Yale School of Public Health. 
They are held in re-education camps, they are taken from orphanages where many are temporarily being lodged even though they have family, they are taken directly off the battlefields by Russian soldiers, and they are split apart from their families while in detention centers. 
Under the Geneva Convention, children in this situation must be registered with the Red Cross, they need to be allowed to call home to let their families know how they are doing, and they need to be taken to a neutral country and out of harms way until they can be reunited. None of these conditions of safety are currently being met. 
According to the organization Bring Kids Back, under the direction of the President of the Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, there are currently 19,546 children who have been abducted; only 1,269 of those have been returned to their Ukrainian families. 
International humanitarian law defines these acts of abduction as kidnapping, the children must be returned without conditions. They are not pawns. 
In Idaho, our communities have been welcoming and supportive of Ukrainians coming to the U.S. from this war.  We have had fundraisers for Ukrainian refugees and for general support to those Ukrainians living in combat zone. 
In addition to the daily dangers and horrors of war, thousands of Ukrainian families are experiencing the terrible nightmare of not knowing where their children are amidst the ongoing violence. Child abduction is another facet of a conflict that needs to be resolved by securing a permanent peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia.

Tennessee lawmakers could spend $6 million to audit Memphis Shelby County Schools as a potential forerunner to a state “takeover” of the district.
Senate finance committee Chairman Bo Watson confirmed Monday another $3 million for a forensic audit was placed in the Senate’s $59.6 billion budget plan to go with $3 million in Gov. Bill Lee’s supplemental budget amendment.
Senators also placed $4.5 million in the budget plan to expand Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s special litigation unit, which previously was tasked with opposing former President Joe Biden’s policies.
When the 2025 session started, Republican lawmakers started discussing appointment of a state management board that would supersede the elected Memphis Shelby County School Board. Memphis residents testified against the bill.

The proposal hasn’t gained a foothold yet, but lawmakers appear bent on auditing the school district even though the Comptroller’s Office conducts school system audits.
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Shelby County Republican, said Monday the audit is needed to start a deeper look at the school district.
“That kind of money spent on that kind of audit, that’s the kind of audit that somebody goes to the pokey over, and this is something that’s been building for decades, and it’s time we finally take the bull by the horns,” Taylor said. He didn’t pinpoint any wrongdoing on the part of Memphis Shelby County Schools officials.
Taylor, who is sponsoring the bill to make major changes in the district, said lawmakers shied away from a takeover because of problems with the Achievement School District, which is being abolished because it failed to make major improvements over a decade in spite of a billion dollars in expenses. The bill’s wording remains in talks, though, and an advisory board could be placed in the measure, he said.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville, a member of the finance committee, called the pending expenditure “ridiculous.”
“The purpose of our school funding is to educate children, not to create ammunition for some garbage political fights,” Yarbro said.
Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis has been pushing for change this session to deal with what he calls “a decades-old issue of underperformance.”










The purpose of our school funding is to educate children, not to create ammunition for some garbage political fights.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


His bill contains a provision to put a nine-member management group appointed by the state in charge of operating the school district, giving it authority over the locally-elected school board and administrators. 
Taylor’s version isn’t quite as restrictive but puts the state in charge by allowing Tennessee’s education commissioner, with approval from the Department of Education, to remove the schools director or school board members and allow the county commission to replace them. If a school district goes through three district directors in three years, a county mayor could appoint a new director for a four-year term.
The Senate bill also would lift income caps on the Education Savings Account in effect in Shelby County, the governor’s initial private-school voucher program, and change the process for a public school to become a charter school.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)In the more than two years that Colorado has accepted cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes, the amount Coloradans have submitted using the new form of payment is essentially nonexistent.
The Colorado Department of Revenue in September 2022 started accepting cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for all state taxes, including income tax, business income tax, sales and use taxes, and severance tax. The move was spearheaded with fanfare by Gov. Jared Polis.
State acceptance of digital currency is “important symbolically to show that we are a crypto-forward state,” Polis said when he announced the new feature, according to Westword.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In the four months that remained that year after the program went live, the state received eight cryptocurrency payments for a total of $16,426, according to state data obtained by Newsline.
In 2023, the state received 22 cryptocurrency payments for a total of $23,241, and in 2024 it received 48 payments for a total of $17,544.
The state typically takes in many billions of dollars a year in tax revenues. In fiscal year 2022-23, for example, it received $11 billion in individual income tax alone. The sum of all cryptocurrency the state received through the end of 2024 represents 0.006% of that figure.
“Colorado was the first state to innovate and accept cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes under the leadership of Governor Jared Polis,” Elizabeth Kosar, director of communications of the Colorado Department of Revenue, said in an email.
Kosar noted that Colorado doesn’t actually accept cryptocurrency. When taxpayers pay the state with cryptocurrency, they submit the payment through the PayPal Cryptocurrencies Hub, which converts the digital money to U.S. dollars before it’s sent to the state.
Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tout the digital asset as being supported by a decentralized system free of government regulation or manipulation. Critics note that crypto is often used to facilitate money laundering, illicit trade and corruption. It also contributes to environmental degradation, and it’s subject to price manipulation and wild volatility. Just over a month after Polis announced Colorado’s move to accept digital currency, the crypto market crashed and Bitcoin lost 70% of its value.
State taxes, as well as federal taxes, are due Tuesday.

This story was originally published by The Institute for Public Service Reporting Memphis. 
Memphis simmered in the July heat as a police cruiser pulled over a blue Nissan Altima motoring through the downtown business district. The car’s temporary tag had expired days earlier, an oversight police often resolve by issuing a citation.
But this traffic stop took a more serious turn when a Memphis Police Department officer said he “could smell an odor consistent with marijuana coming out of the vehicle.’’
After questioning a female passenger, police found slightly more than a half-ounce of marijuana in her purse — a small but critical amount that led officers to arrest the family-focused grandmother on a felony drug-trafficking charge.
As a special task force begins reviewing U.S. Justice Department claims of abuse by MPD during traffic stops, reform advocates say the woman’s arrest is yet another example of overly aggressive policing in Memphis.
“It’s absolutely a trumped-up charge,” said Claiborne Ferguson, a longtime Memphis defense attorney who reviewed the July 2, 2024, police affidavit filed against the woman. He has no official connection to the case.
The woman, a cancer victim, said she is no drug dealer and doesn’t even smoke that much.
“It was crazy,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified. Although the charge against her was later dropped, she said she fears any association with a criminal charge. “I’m a real-life good person. I treat everyone with respect,” she said.
The incident is one of 13 traffic-stop cases identified by the Institute for Public Service Reporting in which Shelby County law enforcement officers signed felony marijuana affidavits, only to see those charges vacated in court. Attorneys who reviewed the affidavits for The Institute said they appeared deficient in supporting felony charges of intent to sell.
The charges — which often involved warrantless searches of vehicles — led arrestees to spend several hours or more in jail.
“I lost my job,” said Dominique Hodges, 26, who was arrested in December. Prosecutors dropped the charges in February, but not before she spent a terrifying night at Jail East, Shelby County’s women’s holding facility, and paid $700 in attorney fees and costs. She said the charges hanging over her caused her to lose a good-paying maintenance job.
“I cried and I cried,’’ she said of her trip to jail. There, jailers conducted an invasive search, she said. Later, Hodges watched in fear as an irate arrestee hit her fist against a wall over and over. “I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy,’’ she said.
Among the 13 arrestees, 12 were Black, including Hodges and the grandmother.
All the arrests were made after officers said they smelled marijuana and either requested consent to search or used the smell as probable cause to search vehicles without consent.
The 13 arrests included ten by MPD, two by the Sheriff’s Office and one by the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
Both MPD and the Highway Patrol declined comment. The Sheriff’s Office didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

 Broad police discretion

The Institute identified the 13 cases while reviewing eight months of arrest data, including a six-month stretch between last April and September and a follow-up two-month stretch in December and January to assess patterns following the release of the Justice Department’s critical Dec. 4 report.
Traffic stops reviewed by The Institute followed a general pattern: Motorists were pulled over for a missing headlight or taillight, tinted windows, expired or missing tags, failing to wear a seat belt and occasionally for speeding or running a red light.
Officers then searched vehicles after saying they smelled marijuana.
Simple possession of small amounts of marijuana is a misdemeanor in Tennessee, which remains among a slim minority of states that haven’t legalized medicinal or recreational marijuana. In Shelby County, where marijuana prosecutions have been deprioritized, police can issue a misdemeanor citation for simple possession without making an arrest. At times, officers take no action at all when stopping motorists with small amounts of marijuana, according to interviews conducted by The Institute.
But a felony charge brings a guaranteed trip to jail.
Police generally have broad discretion when making arrests. Probable cause to arrest requires a lower threshold of evidence than proof required at trial, and police tend to charge suspects at the highest level available, defense attorneys said.

The case for pretextual traffic stops

Attorneys who reviewed arrest affidavits for The Institute said some appeared to be borderline cases or “close calls” in establishing probable cause for a felony charge. In one case, a motorist charged with felony intent to sell was found with a small amount of marijuana and three guns, including a semi-automatic rifle. Records suggest it was a difficult matter to sort out: All the guns turned out to be legal. Tennessee doesn’t require permits to carry guns, and it allows most people other than individuals convicted of felonies to freely transport them in cars.
Such incidents require quick judgments often made under high-stress conditions, police say.
“It’s very tough because you don’t know what’s in that car,’’ said Mike Williams, a former patrolman and past president of the Memphis Police Association, a labor union. “I couldn’t imagine me personally being out there in the streets right now … because everybody has a damn gun. And a lot of these young people that are running around with these guns, they’re not afraid to use them.”

The case against pretextual traffic stops


But reform advocates say there is a delicate balance between protecting public safety and eroding community trust. Even if a charge is later dismissed, arrests often pose hardships including job loss along with stiff fees and court costs. Often, vehicles are seized.
“So now because I get caught with this … I have to hire a lawyer. I have to go pay a bond. Get probation,’’ said Keedran Franklin, a criminal justice reform advocate who contends police often target people of color. “That … may put me $30,000 in debt.’’
Overall, African-Americans represented 89 of 93 Shelby County defendants (96 percent) identified by The Institute as having been arrested between last April and September after officers said they smelled marijuana. Many of the traffic stops, which often led to charges unconnected to marijuana possession, were clustered in African-American neighborhoods in Orange Mound, Frayser, Hickory Hill and South and North Memphis.

MPD’s focus on saturation patrols in “high-crime” neighborhoods and the potential for harassment alarmed Justice Department officials, who noted in the Dec. 4 report that Memphis police stopped one Black man 30 times in three years.
Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy said police need discretion when making arrests but conceded that evidence at times can’t support felony charges.
“It is not at all uncommon for the police to bring us a charge for felony intent to sell marijuana and we reduce it to a misdemeanor. And largely that’s not necessarily because we’re saying that the police overcharged but because there is a difference between the amount of evidence you need for probable cause to arrest and the amount of evidence you need to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt at trial,” Mulroy said.
“So, I’m not going to use a heavily charged word like abuse, but I will say that given the fact that the arrest itself can be disruptive to someone’s life, and given that it seems like this particular charge seems disproportionately targeted on the African-American community … one can see how a really aggressive posture of arresting and charging felonies for what may simply be simple marijuana possession can be problematic. It may be something that maybe this task force can look at.”
The task force he refers to was formed when Mayor Paul Young tapped former federal appeals court judge Bernice Donald to review Justice Department allegations outlined in its Dec. 4 report. The 70-page report found MPD often conducts unlawful stops and searches, discriminates against Black people and uses excessive force.

Small amounts, big charges
It was three days before Christmas, and Dominque Hodges was out partying with friends. They took her battered Chrysler Sebring, though she was riding as a passenger that night. When police spotted the car — missing rear bumper, burned-out front headlight, invalid drive-out tags — they pulled it over.
“They snatched me out of the car,’’ Hodges recalled.
According to her arrest affidavit, police searched the car after smelling marijuana and found a bag containing 18 grams, roughly enough to roll 18 to 36 marijuana cigarettes. Hodges said she admitted the pot was hers, arguing that she’s a smoker not a dealer.
“I’m telling them, ‘Why am I going to jail for this little bit … Look, my mom is sick. I don’t have nobody that’s going to come and bail me out of jail.’ ’’
Under Tennessee law, a person who possesses a half-ounce (14.175 grams) or more of marijuana with the intent to manufacture, sell or deliver is guilty of a felony punishable by 11 months to 60 years in prison depending on the amount and an individual’s prior record. Selling less than a half-ounce is a misdemeanor.
But defense attorneys say many officers don’t seem to understand that simple possession — even in amounts greater than 14.175 grams — is still a misdemeanor if the defendant lacked intent to sell.
“I have regularly heard officers and prosecutors say more than ½ (ounce) is a ‘felony amount’ but that is incorrect,’’ said Ben Raybin, a Nashville-based defense and civil rights attorney. “There still has to be an intent to sell, deliver, or manufacture.’’
Courts have ruled that to prove intent, authorities need evidence of something more than mere weight. They need other supporting details such as finding marijuana packaged in multiple baggies, large amounts of cash, firearms, ledgers, digital scales or other indicators of a drug sale.
Yet repeatedly, records show, officers arrest motorists on charges of felony intent to sell marijuana with scant supporting evidence of an indication to sell — charges that are later vacated in court. The cases reviewed by The Institute were dropped by prosecutors via an action known as nolle prosequi, or the abandonment of a criminal charge.
In the July 2, 2024, arrest of the grandmother in Downtown Memphis, for example, police reported finding 16.1 grams in her purse. In an affidavit of complaint sworn out before a judicial magistrate, police listed no other evidence indicating an intent to sell. The woman was booked into Jail East, Shelby County’s detention facility for female arrestees. The charge was later dropped.
“I don’t see the slightest hint of evidence that she possessed it with the intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell it, so in my opinion this should have been charged (with) a misdemeanor rather than a felony,’’ Raybin wrote in an email. “If that was her only charge (it was), she should have been given a citation rather than placed under a custodial arrest.”
Defendants charged with misdemeanors often are cited and released without being booked into jail. In some instances of simple marijuana possession, officers don’t even do that much, some allege.
“Most of the times (when) we get stopped, the police put the weed right back in the car,” Hodges said.
Recently retired General Sessions Court Judge Bill Anderson said that he’s heard similar accounts.
“It’s gotten out to the rank-and-file police on the street that the DA is not prosecuting small amounts of marijuana,’’ Anderson said. “These officers … don’t like coming to court. They don’t like wasting their time having to write report after report. So if it’s a small amount, what I understand they’re doing is just throwing it away or telling them, open it up, throw it out on the street or something.”
Overall, officers seize relatively small amounts of marijuana when making traffic stops on Memphis streets.
Among the 93 odor-triggered arrests identified by The Institute, the median amount of marijuana confiscated was 20 grams. That’s roughly enough to roll 20 to 40 marijuana cigarettes.
Studies suggest traffic stops like these aren’t effective in reducing overall crime rates, but they can accumulate significant arrests. During one day three-day stretch in June, The Institute found, MPD arrested at least ten people after smelling marijuana, including five with violent arrest histories and another with glassy eyes and slow reactions who was charged with driving while intoxicated by marijuana.
In those 10 arrests, police confiscated two assault-style rifles and a Glock 17 handgun with a switch that converted it to a rapid-fire machinegun and three other pistols.
 Questions surround MPD’s supervision and training

Marijuana grown today is much more potent — and pungent — than in years past. Its smell wafts across Memphis, emanating from cars, seats at Tiger football games, street corners and alleyways.
Still, attorneys interviewed for this story said they believe police at times manufacture claims that they smelled marijuana as a pretext to create probable cause to search a vehicle.
The Justice Department report articulated similar concerns.
“While officers often justify vehicle and pedestrian searches based on statements that they have smelled the ‘odor of marijuana,’ courts and MPD’s own internal affairs unit has found that those justifications are not always credible,’’ the report said.
“… A prosecutor described MPD’s explanations as sometimes ‘cringey,’ and gave the example of an officer claiming to have smelled marijuana in a car that was going 60 miles per hour.”
It’s difficult to assess how widespread the problem may be.

“The problem is I don’t know (the full extent of) the abuses because nobody’s forcing them to keep up any records of when they search a vehicle saying they smelled marijuana and not finding anything,” Ferguson said.
Again, the Justice Department articulated similar concerns.
“This data does not include hundreds of thousands of traffic stops that did not result in citations, because MPD officers do not document the reason for those stops,” the report said.
But the report was unequivocal in stating that MPD engages in a pattern of illegal traffic stops, arrests and evidence collection in violation of the Fourth Amendment that protects citizens against unreasonable search and seizure.
“The pattern of Fourth Amendment violations stems from MPD’s decision to prioritize traffic enforcement as a central method to address crime in Memphis, while at the same time failing to ensure that officers understand and follow constitutional requirements when they stop and detain people,’’ said the report, which followed an 18-month investigation launched after the January 2023 police beating death of motorist Tyre Nichols.
“…Supervisors rarely review traffic stops to ensure they meet constitutional standards. But they do measure officers’ ‘productivity’ based in part on how many stops and citations they generate.’’
Ferguson said he believes MPD’s struggles stem from either poor training or coaching by supervising lieutenants.
“It’s either bad training or it’s purposeful malicious prosecution in order to seize vehicles. That’s all it can be,’’ Ferguson said. “Either they’re completely not training these officers or they train them specifically to do this to get into the car.”
The Justice Department report raised similar concerns.
“Officers will, for example, write in reports that they smelled marijuana, but there will be no mention of the odor of marijuana on body-worn camera footage,’’ the report said.
Such a scenario played out in federal court last year when prosecutors dismissed gun charges against Cedric Jackson, now 33, after inconsistencies arose between police reports and body camera footage.
Officers wrote in an October 2022 affidavit that they “observed a green residue consistent with Marijuana’’ on the console of Jackson’s Chevy Tahoe. Citing that as probable cause to search the vehicle, officers found a Smith & Wesson handgun that Jackson, a convicted felon, could not legally possess.

“I am having trouble with the search,’’ U.S. District Court Judge Thomas L. Parker said in a Jan. 4, 2024, hearing after reviewing bodycam footage. “… If they were relying on noticing the residue of marijuana on the console, I didn’t hear anybody say so at the time. I watched several videos and so I did not … see a lot of discussion about that. There were no photographs of the residue on the console area, so the Court finds that the Government did not carry its burden to show that that was the basis for a search.’’
Though Parker later dismissed a defense motion to suppress evidence seized in the search, finding the items would have been detected later in a routine inventory search of the car, the case’s credibility appeared shaken by defense challenges. Parker eventually approved a motion by prosecutors to dismiss the case.
Asked why prosecutors moved to dismiss the case, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Memphis declined comment.
Evolving marijuana laws
Odor-related searches have grown complicated in Tennessee, in part because of law changes in other states. Tennessee is one of just 11 states where recreational or medicinal marijuana use hasn’t been legalized, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Yet motorists on Memphis’ streets may be carrying medicinal marijuana bought across the river in Arkansas or across the border in Mississippi. Recreational marijuana can be purchased via a short, 90-minute drive into southern Missouri.
“Now (when they return to Memphis) they’re presumed to be a felony drug dealer,’’ said defense lawyer Michael Working. “… You’re coming back with more than 14.175 grams every time. It’s like, you know, you don’t go to Arkansas to buy legal beer and buy (just) one can of beer.”
In Shelby County, simple possession of small amounts of marijuana often is tolerated.
District Attorney Mulroy said simple possession prosecutions had been de-prioritized by his predecessor, Amy Weirich, though the practice varied among individual prosecutors, he said.
“I think it’s more uniform now (in) that it is not a priority,” Mulroy said. “We still enforce it. I mean, it’s the law, right? We enforce it. But we’ve got so many more important things to focus on, like violent crime.” Though there is “no blanket rule,” misdemeanor marijuana cases can lead to community service followed by a dismissal of the charges, he said.

Consequently, police often won’t bring misdemeanor cases, defense attorneys said. What’s emerged is a sort of felony-or-nothing situation. And as courts have trimmed back on Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, the smell of marijuana as justification to search a vehicle has become all but impossible for defendants to overcome, defense attorneys say.
But a Tennessee Supreme Court ruling last summer may change some of the ground rules for marijuana-related traffic stops.
In that case, state of Tennessee vs. Andre Jujuan Lee Green, the court ruled that the smell of marijuana alone is not enough for a search, finding that officers must consider “the totality of the circumstances” before conducting a warrantless search.
The case originates from Clarksville, Tennessee, where officers used a drug-sniffing dog to find an ounce of marijuana, a gun and baggies during a February 2020 traffic stop. Defense attorneys argued the search was improper because a police dog can’t tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. Both are varieties of the same species. Congress legalized hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill and Tennessee followed suit in 2019.
The court rejected a defense motion to dismiss the case. Although it found that “the legalization of hemp has added a degree of ambiguity to a dog’s positive alert,” it ruled the search was merited by a totality of circumstances that included “suspicious answers” that the car’s occupants gave to officers’ questions and a backpack seen in plain view inside the car. Both the car’s driver and passenger denied ownership of the backpack.
Raybin said the Green case means officers will no longer be able to conduct probable cause searches of vehicles based solely on the odor of marijuana.
“In my opinion that is directly precluded by the Green case and everything should be thrown out,’’ said Raybin, who co-authored a friend-of-the-court brief in support of dismissing charges in the case.
How much actual impact the ruling will have remains to be seen, however. Officers don’t need much in the way of additional factors to justify a search, Raybin said. It can involve something as simple as a defendant appearing nervous, “sweating profusely” or making inconsistent statements.
“…It still won’t take too much’’ to justify a search, Raybin said.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The regular session of the West Virginia Legislature ended Saturday night, but not before there was one last big fight that gave the majority a chance to show their disdain for West Virginians who don’t look like them. 
The biggest fight of the final night — if not the whole session — was Senate Bill 474, legislation to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the state.
Republicans seem to see DEI as hiring someone who is unqualified and not white over the most qualified white candidate in the world. Or maybe they just assume someone who is not white isn’t qualified, no matter the truth.
In reality, DEI gives an even playing field for women, people of color, veterans and people with disabilities in the work force. It makes places more diverse because diversity is critical in all workplaces.
Dems tried their hardest to run the time out on the bill in the House Saturday night. Dels. Sean Hornbuckle, Anitra Hamilton and Hollis Lewis — the only Black members of the West Virginia Legislature — all gave speeches about why DEI is important.
Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, asked Republican lawmakers what problem the bill was trying to solve. He was given a vague answer about there being “divisions” in schools, offices, policies and programs in the state, and the bill will eliminate those “divisions.”
“Mr. Speaker, I rise and guess I can’t really say I’m surprised, because we’ve talked about this for a while, but I’m shocked that several in the body would continue with this Boogeyman,” Hornbuckle said. “I’m a little bit confused as well, little bit angry. I don’t think there’s a problem. I know there’s not a problem. We’re scurrying around here like never before to get a bill passed, so much so that you would think it was a landmark piece of legislation to create hundreds of jobs.”
There were no landmark pieces of legislation that created hundreds of jobs passed during this session.
Hornbuckle also questioned Republicans who felt they had to vote for the bill.
“There’s a couple people in here that are friends of mine, and as a Black man — how I operate, I’m gonna be friends with you after this vote … and you’re gonna tell me, ‘I had to do it, man. I don’t believe in it, but I had to do it. I had to do it.’ You didn’t have to do nothing. For what? The seat? Is a seat that important?”
I don’t know how any of the 87 Republicans who still voted to ban DEI after the delegates explained the adversity they face daily will be able to look Hornbuckle, Hamilton and Lewis in the eye after Saturday.
Hamilton, D-Monongalia, also gave a passionate speech explaining why diversity is so important, as the only Black woman in the entire Legislature.
“We tell the state every day that you’re not welcome here. You’re welcome to work here, but your voice don’t matter. We want your work. We want your money, but your equity and your worth don’t matter. That’s the kind of message that we send.”
Last year was Hamilton’s first year in the Legislature. She was appointed to fill Danielle Walker’s seat after she resigned.
“Do y’all know that last year, when I came here for the first three months, I had to tell everybody that I’m Danielle Walker, because I had to make sure that you guys could embrace me …” Hamilton said. “ … Do you also know, last year —  have any of y’all ever been stopped at the door and not allowed to come in? Have you? I was stopped at a public meeting and asked, ‘Can I help you?’ I said, ‘No.’ ‘Do you need help?’ ‘No, I do not.’ …  I had a seat at the table and still have to explain why I deserve to be in the room. It happens all the time.”
Hamilton also explained the importance of representation.
“How would you feel if you went to class and they have erased your entire history out of the history books? How would you feel? How would you feel if you went to work and nobody on your job looked like you? Would it give you hope? No, it wouldn’t. You would have to find hope within yourself to say, ‘I still belong,’ and then try to be representation, and fight for a state that don’t fight for you.”
Lewis, D-Kanawha, spoke on what this bill will do to limit teachers by requiring they also teach alternative theories.
“What’s the alternative theory to slavery?” he asked. “What’s the alternative theory to why West Virginia succeeded from Virginia and joined the Union? What alternative are we offering? What we’re doing is we’re handcuffing our educators so they’re not going to want to teach these sort of things.”
Lewis looked back on how little he learned about the history of Black West Virginians in public school. He talked about how, even though he went to the same college as Katherine Johnson, he didn’t know about her until the movie “Hidden Figures” came out.
“I can remember sitting in the class for months after months after months, and I didn’t learn anything about myself. You would have thought that me and my family and the people I knew were the only Black people to ever be in West Virginia.”
Hamilton really gave the perfect summary of this Republican supermajority’s hypocrisy:
“Isn’t it something that we trust teachers with concealed weapons, but we can’t trust our teachers to teach history?” Hamilton said.
After nearly three hours of debate in the House, the bill passed at 10:41 p.m., and moved to the Senate.
When the bill advanced to the Senate, 13 amendments from Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, appeared to be pending on the legislation — a tactic to run out the clock to keep the bill from passing.
However, Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, made a motion to suspend legislative Joint Rule 3 — a rule that governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers. That motion was adopted and the Senate then concurred with and passed the House’s version of the bill 31-2 without any consideration of Garcia’s amendments.
In an interview afterward, Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, said he also didn’t quite understand the legislative procedures that led to the passage of SB 474. Garcia said the Republican used “dirty tricks” to get the bill passed.
As a white woman, who has not experienced the discrimination that Hamilton, Hornbuckle and Lewis deal with, I can’t explain as well as they did how damaging this bill will be. But Hamilton, Hornbuckle and Lewis’ appeal to their colleagues’ better nature and sense of justice was ignored. 
Republicans in our Legislature need to stop ignoring scientists and experts to blindly follow whatever President Donald Trump has ordered. They need to stop ignoring people who don’t look like them. They need to listen to people who live and work here.

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
 ‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.












There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.

CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
 Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Following the passage of a Kentucky law that eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in higher education, the state’s public universities say they are reviewing how they are required to implement the law. 
The Republican-controlled Kentucky General Assembly overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of House Bill 4 last month. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said during deliberation on her bill that it “would allow our universities and colleges to return to their focus away from social engineering to provide Kentucky students with excellent academic instruction in an environment that fosters critical thinking through open, constructive dialog.”
However, at least one Kentucky college student, Bradley Price, says the law will change the culture of her campus “and it’s going to be irreparable.” 
Price, a Black student who enrolled in the University of Louisville’s Pan-African Studies program because of the university’s reputation as a diverse institution, frequently went to Frankfort throughout the legislative session to protest against the bill. Price was among advocates who witnessed Beshear sign the veto for the legislation. 
“Obviously, it was the outcome that I knew was coming, but I was still utterly disappointed, for lack of a better term,” Price said of the overturned veto in a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern. 
Price, a junior, said she’s already seeing some changes at UofL, such as a sign promoting diversity in business being taken down, and has heard name changes may be coming to programs for Martin Luther King scholars to comply with HB 4. When asked about those changes, UofL spokesperson John Karman said he could not speculate “on potential impacts at this point.”
Though she is originally from Kentucky, Price feels like continuing her education in the state would be a challenge. She wants to pursue a PhD in English literature and ultimately teach in higher education herself. 
“I’m personally discouraged from continuing any more education in Kentucky,” Price said. “I don’t see any value in it. It’s exhausting having my identities constantly attacked every legislative session.”
Universities review the law
HB 4 directs the governing boards of Kentucky’s public universities to enact a policy by June 30 to meet requirements under the law such as not restricting scholarship eligibility criteria on the basis of religion, race, sex, color, or national origin and not requiring or encouraging students to complete courses “of which the primary purpose is to indoctrinate participants with a discriminatory concept.”
Next year on July 1, each institution must begin submitting annual certification to the Council on Postsecondary Education to verify the institution has not spent money to support DEI programs.
Newly installed UofL President Gerry Bradley told members of the Faculty Senate earlier this month that the university was reviewing the law with all general counsels of Kentucky public universities and the office of Attorney General Russell Coleman to “determine what exactly are the provisions of this bill and what are the carve outs and where is the crossing the line.”
He expanded on those comments in a press conference the next day and emphasized that UofL would remain a “community of care” for all students while meeting the requirements of the law. Bradley also said he plans to meet with students, faculty and staff as part of a listening tour throughout the rest of 2025. 
“And clearly our intent is we will comply with law, but we will clearly continue with our mission, which is to make every person feel like they belong here, that they are a part of our community, and that means different things for different people, and I think we have to be meeting people in those spaces, and we have to support them,” Bradley said. 
Last year, the University of Kentucky and Northern Kentucky University closed their DEI offices after a similar bill failed to pass during the 2024 legislative session. 
In response to the Lantern, UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said the university “will, of course, comply with the law” and added that “we believe UK already complies with the legislation” based on changes initiated last fall under President Eli Capilouto’s direction, such as closing UK’s DEI office. 
“We will be working with the other institutions and the Council on Postsecondary Education with respect to the required survey,” Blanton said. “Further, the legislation contains clear language protecting academic freedom and instruction, which we communicate with our campus community about regularly.” 
At NKU, President Cady Short-Thompson wrote in a March 28 campus-wide email that the university “will make the necessary changes to ensure we comply with the law” but will continue to support all students, faculty and staff. She announced that some programs on campus would have their names changed to reflect the law, such as renaming the “Center for Student Inclusiveness” to the “Center for Community and Connections.” 
“These are challenging decisions and times; yet our mission of student access and success has never been more essential,” Short-Thompson wrote. “It is my sincere hope that we can reimagine a way to build connections across our students and colleagues in new and still meaningful ways, learning from one another about our various differences and similarities. I believe in the strength, dedication, and impact of the people of Northern Kentucky University. We will navigate these challenges together.”

Other public universities and colleges in Kentucky echoed those sentiments. April Hobbs Nutter, a spokesperson for Morehead State University, said its general counsel is reviewing the law and MSU will “remain dedicated to our mission of providing a high-quality education and fostering an environment where our students can succeed.” 
Jace Lux, Western Kentucky University spokesperson, said the university “remains committed to maintaining a welcoming and supportive environment for all members of our campus community.” WKU’s general counsel and campus leadership are reviewing all passed legislation to determine how it will impact the university. Before part of HB 4 takes effect this summer, Lux said “we will share any necessary updates with the campus community.” 
Eastern Kentucky University is also reviewing the law and plans to comply with it, said spokesperson Sarah Baker in a statement. 
“Our employees work hard to provide support services that help all our students cross the finish line at graduation and obtain their degrees,” Baker said. “We will continue to work tirelessly every day to meet our students where they are, provide them with world-class academic programming and support their journey.”
Murray State University said in a statement that it is “continuing to thoughtfully navigate possible impacts enacted at the state and federal levels” like other higher education institutions within Kentucky and nationwide. 
“As we continue to assess and adjust as needed, Murray State remains committed to the success and support of all of our students throughout their collegiate experience,” the statement said. 
Kentucky State University, the state’s only public historically Black college or university, is reviewing the bill and its requirements, said spokesperson Jessica Holman. The university declined to give an official statement at this time. 
The Kentucky Community and Technical College System has been “reviewing programs, events, and resources to verify compliance with HB 4,” said spokesperson Blair Hess. KCTCS plans to comply with the law as well. 
“KCTCS has and will continue to provide support to all students to ensure they are successful in completing their credential and entering the workforce as prepared and skilled as possible,” Hess said. “We are committed to educating the workforce of Kentucky, and that does not have to change.”
When asked about her thoughts on universities planning to comply with the law while continuing to support students, Price said that’s likely not possible. 
“I just don’t think it’s feasible for the schools to be able to support all their students if legally they are not allowed to even have programs that support their marginalized students,” she said. “I don’t think it’s going to work.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3824-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

(University of Kentucky photo)In the wake of last week’s stock market turmoil, The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled, “Will the Last Investor to Leave America Please Turn Out the Lights?” The author, James Mackintosh, argues that the stock market’s wild gyrations — and, in particular, the instability in the valuation of Treasury notes and the U.S. dollar — indicate nothing less than a loss of faith in America. The previously unthinkable possibility of a default is looming on the horizon. The period of American economic exceptionalism is over.
What a sad and pathetic outcome after only three months of an administration that came to power on a promise to “Make America Great Again.” But the leader of that movement — I didn’t say its führer — does not understand soft power. The only language he appears to be able to speak is crude and violent. It involves threats, fear and the denigration of opponents both at home and abroad. Did I say “opponents”? Our president and his team take pleasure in insulting allies and friends. 
But this piece is not devoted to foreign policy or the economy, areas in which I cannot claim greater expertise than any reasonably well-informed citizen. I am writing about conditions at the University of Kentucky, where I teach and conduct my scholarly work. 
The chaotic and incompetent policies of our current national administration are producing the same effects in academe that James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal has diagnosed in the economic sphere: loss of faith in America. 
The Kentucky Lantern recently reported on the revocation of visas held by international graduate students at the University of Kentucky. We have not learned how many visas were revoked, apart from the fact that the number was said to be “small.” Neither have we learned anything about the grounds on which the visas were canceled. 
Were the affected graduate students guilty of illegal acts: theft, sexual assault, rioting? It would be easy to see why visas would be withdrawn in such circumstances. But perhaps they were just citizens of the “wrong” countries or made comments critical of Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza. Perhaps they even criticized our Great Leader!
I suspect that there is a system behind the uncertainty: the goal is to instill fear. In this goal, the administration has certainly succeeded. Many of our international graduate students are afraid that they could be arrested — in broad daylight, by masked immigration agents — and whisked away to some deportation center, where they would be on their own, isolated from colleagues and friends.
 Their transgression could be as trivial as having authored an opinion piece in a student newspaper. What a terrible, terrible betrayal of the young scholars, scientists, and artists who came to America looking forward to a great education.
 What a betrayal of the ideals of American higher education, renowned worldwide for its high standards, professionalism and academic freedom. Even the vast majority of international graduate students who will not be affected by the current purge will lose some — much, perhaps all — of their respect and admiration for our country. We are facing a loss of cultural influence, “soft power,” in the educational arena that is tragic and was altogether avoidable. 
I myself came to the United States in 1997 to take up my first tenure-track position. I never regretted my decision. In 2011, I became a proud citizen. More recently, I returned to America after a disappointing few years of teaching in Europe, whose universities I found infected, suffocated even by clichés of progressive group-thinking. 
So, yes, I am a conservative, a Republican — and totally shocked that our Republican members of Congress are letting all this happen.
 “All this” refers to the abandonment of the rule of law that is behind the current chaos and dysfunction. Just as international graduate students and undocumented immigrants are removed from the country without due process, so the tariffs that have led to last week’s market collapse have been imposed on the basis of highly questionable emergency powers. A group of Democratic senators — joined by Rand Paul, Republican from Kentucky, along with several other Republican senators — have introduced bipartisan legislation to curb the president’s falsely claimed authority to impose tariffs.
So there is yet hope — hope that there will be enough honorable Republicans who, along with their Democratic colleagues, are going to restore the rule of law in this country. If this happens soon, perhaps the damage inflicted by the Trump presidency can still be contained.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-e1744672067253.png,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

Veteran constitutional […]","Demonstrators in downtown Raleigh declare Allison Riggs rightfully won the state Supreme Court race against Jefferson Griffin.  (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)It’s hard to overstate the magnitude and importance of the injustice that four members of the North Carolina Supreme Court – Chief Justice Paul Newby and Associate Justices Curtis “Trey” Allen, Tamara Barringer, and Phil Berger, Jr. – are attempting to perpetrate against the people of North Carolina and the rule of law.
Veteran constitutional law scholar Prof. Gene Nichol rightfully put it this way in describing the foul foursome’s decision last Friday to overturn the expressed will of voters and, in effect, steal a Supreme Court election: “On Friday, April 11, 2025, a day in judicial infamy, the North Carolina Supreme Court crossed the Rubicon.” He called on all four to resign.
The object of Prof. Nichol’s thoroughly justified ire, of course, was the group’s outrageous ruling that a large number of ballots legally cast in the November 2024 state Supreme Court election between incumbent Justice Allison Riggs and challenger Jefferson Griffin can be retroactively thrown out because they – the justices – disagree with previous unanimous and bipartisan rulings on managing those ballots rendered long prior to the election by the State Board of Elections.
Think about that for a moment — it’s a stunning concept.
Thousands of voters who cast ballots according to longstanding and duly adopted rules — rules not even controversial enough to have received a single dissenting vote on an election board that’s frequently divided on partisan lines – can now be disenfranchised months after the election in such a way that it will quite possibly overturn the result.
The absurdity of the decision was even too much for conservative Republican Justice Richard Dietz. As he wrote in a passionate and on-the mark dissenting opinion:

        “By every measure, this is the most impactful election-related court decision our state has seen in decades. It cries out for our full review and for a decisive rejection of this sort of post hoc judicial tampering in election results.”    
 
Dietz went on to say that even if the federal courts ultimately set the matter right, his four colleagues have opened a dangerous Pandora’s Box:

        “Even if the federal courts ultimately reverse the Court of Appeals decision…the door is open for losing candidates to try this sort of post-election meddling in state court in the future. We should not allow that.”    
 
Dietz’s critique of changing election rules after the ballots are in goes to the heart of what’s so grievously wrong with the majority’s decision, but for those trying to better understand what’s really going on here, a look at the practicalities of overseas voting and the rules the election board adopted is also helpful.
The issue here is whether those voters should have been required to provide a copy of their photo ID with their ballots.
As NC Newsline’s Lynn Bonner reported in early February, there were big and utterly reasonable legal and practical reasons why the board opted not to impose such a requirement.
First and foremost was the likely conflict posed by a federal law called the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA. The election board was rightfully concerned that if it tried to require photo ID of military and overseas voters, it would run afoul of both that (and the common practice in other states).
And then there were the simple practicalities of how such a requirement might have even been implemented. In her report, Bonner spoke with overseas voter Aidan Hunt, who told her that he used the official electronic portal to vote and didn’t believe it even featured a way to send a copy of an ID.
“As best as I can recall, there’s no function to upload random stuff going through that portal. There wasn’t any place designated for an ID,” he said. “It’s not like an email message where you can just put whatever in there.”
All of these factors are more than sufficient to illustrate the folly of the Newby-Allen-Barringer-Berger ruling, but just to add another extra measure of mind-blowing absurdity, consider this: the ruling apparently only applies to some military and overseas ballots that the GOP candidate challenged.
As Justice Anita Earls wrote in her dissenting opinion:

        “What is worse, these targeted voters are only those who happened to have registered in Guilford County, or maybe one of three or four other counties that vote heavily Democratic, the special order is not clear, but in any case, not every such voter in the state.”    
 
You got that? North Carolina is preparing to throw out a bundle of ballots cast by lawful voters, but only in areas more likely to vote Democratic. Riggs, for example, won Guilford County by a margin of more than 25%.
As the saying goes, you really can’t make this stuff up.
Justice Riggs has, of course, appealed to the federal courts, and if there’s any justice left in this creaky old republic, the Newby-Allen-Barringer-Berger abomination will not stand. But even in the best-case scenario, the damage to the legitimacy of our judiciary and the democracy it’s supposed to safeguard will be immense and long-lasting.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250405_124319-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

Oral arguments will be heard Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Rhode Island’s seven-year legal battle against fossil fuel companies has amassed thousands of pages of documents across multiple courts.
But what lawyers will argue in a Tuesday morning hearing in Newport County Superior Court focuses on a single phrase: “and/or.”
Lawyers for Chevron Corp., one of the 21 oil and gas companies named in the 2018 state complaint, want the case tossed on the grounds that the state failed to investigate a key claim in its climate change lawsuit. The challenge filed by then-Attorney General Peter Kilmartin seeks damages from fossil fuel companies on the assertion that for each company, “a substantial portion of fossil fuel products are or have been extracted, refined, transported, traded, distributed, marketed, promoted, manufactured, sold, and/or consumed in Rhode Island.” 
“The State does not present a scintilla of evidence concerning what it knew or whether it conducted any investigation into these facts in 2018 when it filed its Complaint,” Gerald Petros, partner with Providence firm Hinckley Allen & Snyder LLP who is representing Chevron Corp. wrote in a Feb. 7 filing in Newport County Superior Court. Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP is also representing the company in court proceedings.
And, according to Petros, there is no evidence of any oil production or refinement in Rhode Island, as confirmed by the state’s own Office of Energy Resources website as well as the U.S. Department of Energy.
The state offers a different interpretation.
“The phrase “and/or” makes paragraph 21(g)’s meaning plain: The State alleges that a substantial portion of Chevron’s fossil-fuel products are involved in some combination of the in-state activities listed in the sentence — not necessarily all of those activities,” Matthew Edling, a partner with San Francisco-based Sher Edling LLP that joined with the AG’s office on the complaint, wrote in a March 21 response. “The State did not allege that each of the listed activities individually and independently accounted for a substantial portion of Chevron’s fossil fuel business in Rhode Island. That is why the State used the phrase ‘and/or,’ rather than the word ‘and’ by itself.”
The dispute over word choice marks the latest twist in a long and winding saga of the landmark climate action lawsuit. Rhode Island was the first state in the country to sue fossil fuel companies, setting off a wave of similar attempts by other states, cities and counties to use the courts to force oil and gas companies to take responsibility for their part in climate change. The initial 2019 ruling by Providence Superior Court Judge William E. Smith triggered a series of jurisdictional appeals by the fossil fuel companies that weren’t resolved until April 2023, when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the companies’ petition to have the case heard in federal court.
After the case returned to state court, Chevron took issue with the wording of the state’s initial complaint. Both sides verbally agreed in June 204 that they needed more information around the nature of fossil fuel companies’ activities and business in Rhode Island, according to Edling’s response in court. Chevron led negotiations for all the named fossil fuel companies, proposing a voluntary agreement around information sharing on Oct. 3, 2024, Edling wrote. 
The state accepted the offer and returned a signed copy to Chevron the next month, only for Chevron to request new conditions to the agreement. The state pushed back and Chevron pulled out of the agreement. 
By Dec. 13, 2024, Chevron sent the state a letter challenging the paragraph about local impacts of oil production and refinement and demanding the state produce evidence to show Chevron’s local activities. A formal motion to toss the entire lawsuit was filed in Newport County Superior Court in February.
‘Shotgun allegations’
The language spat around “and/or” lays the framework for a more significant allegation regarding the state’s own court rules. Under Chapter 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, any papers or documents submitted by attorneys in any case must have a factual basis — meaning existing evidence or the likelihood of evidence once an investigation is conducted. Chevron’s lawyers allege that the state never attempted to investigate or prove its claims regarding the existence of oil production or refinement in Rhode Island at all, rendering its claims “baseless,” “frivolous,” and in violation of court procedural rules. 
That the lawsuit relies on the exact same wording for all companies named further suggests lack of research, according to the Feb. 7 filing.
“These shotgun allegations beg credulity: did fourteen separate companies all engage in identical activities in Rhode Island?” the motion states.
The state, in turn, points to the six-year span between when its lawsuit was filed, and when the oil and gas company raised questions about procedural violations.
“Chevron has wasted months of the State’s time and resources, and now it wastes the Court’s,” Edling wrote in the March 21 response on behalf of the state.










“These shotgun allegations beg credulity: did fourteen separate companies all engage in identical activities in Rhode Island?”


– From the Feb. 7 motion filed by attorneys for Chevron Corp. in the state climate change lawsuit 


The state also listed examples of Chevron’s historic and ongoing activities in Rhode Island as proof of the factual basis for its case. From the early 20th century until the 1980s, Chevron owned and operated a fuel terminal off Veterans Memorial Parkway in East Providence. Chevron has filed annual reports for its business in Rhode Island with the Rhode Island Department of State through 2024, while selling gas from its Philadelphia refinery into Cumberland Farms gas stations, among others, according to evidence submitted by the state.
Three days later, on March 24, the state filed another motion seeking to force Chevron and the other companies named as plaintiffs to hand over evidence detailing sales at local gas stations, natural gas business activities and advertising in Rhode Island. 
The hearing Tuesday morning before Rhode Island Associate Justice William E. Carnes includes oral arguments over Chevron’s push to toss the case, and the state’s motion to compel companies to provide more evidence on business activity and sales in Rhode Island. An additional hearing is scheduled before Carnes on May 8, according to the public docket.
Judges in four other states, including New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and New York have tossed similar state, county or city-level challenges against fossil fuel companies. But dozens more remain under consideration in state-level courts across the country, including in Massachusetts. 
And in March, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the bid led by Republican state attorneys general that would have blocked these lawsuits from proceeding.
Theodore Boutrous, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher LLP representing Chevron, pointed to the dismissals of similar lawsuits in other state courts when asked for comment.
“These claims are based on interstate and international emissions and, therefore, are precluded and preempted by federal law under clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent,” Boutros said in an emailed statement Monday. “As the New Jersey Superior Court held in dismissing New Jersey’s similar state lawsuit, ‘the leading and most persuasive case supporting dismissal is the Second Circuit decision in City of New York. There, the federal appeals court rejected the availability of state tort law in the climate change context.’”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha maintained the state was on “the right side of the law.”
“It’s rich, pun intended, that Big Oil would suggest that our case isn’t well-grounded in fact, considering that the harsh realities of climate change are presenting themselves all around us while these companies turn a blind eye in order to protect their profits,” Neronha said in a statement Monday. “Look, semantics aside, oil and gas companies must be held responsible for lying and causing great damage to the people of Rhode Island, Americans generally, and the environment. We believe we are on the right side of the law here, and we will make that clear tomorrow in court.”
Legislative parallel 
Meanwhile, lawmakers in 10 states, including Rhode Island, are considering legislation that would force fossil fuel companies to pay recovery costs for climate-related disasters.
Rhode Island’s proposed “Climate Superfund” bill would allow the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management to bill companies that “engaged in the trade or business of extracting or refining fossil fuels,” based on what the state or municipalities spent on climate mitigation since 2009. Any company responsible for emitting or producing at least 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2024 would be subject to review and potential repayment to state and local entities, according to the bills cosponsored by Democratic Rep. Jennifer Boylan of Barrington, and Sen. Linda Ujifusa of Portsmouth.
Similar policies were adopted by lawmakers in Vermont and New York last year.
Boylan described the proposal as a parallel way to recoup damages from big polluters, rather than an alternative to the state’s ongoing climate action lawsuit.
“Both are important,” Boylan said in an interview on Monday.










It’s rich, pun intended, that Big Oil would suggest that our case isn’t well-grounded in fact, considering that the harsh realities of climate change are presenting themselves all around us while these companies turn a blind eye in order to protect their profits.

Rhode Island is staring down a projected $250 million budget deficit for its upcoming fiscal year, alongside potentially disastrous cuts to federal funding. That makes additional revenue sources especially important to pay for projects that protect against sea level rise, flooding and other climate change-induced disasters, Boylan said.
“Every day that we wait, the amount we’re spending on climate mitigation is getting bigger and bigger,” Boylan said. “It’s not just about having oil rigs or being near the coast. It’s really catastrophic, unprecedented weather, and you combine that with sea level rise, it’s a real problem.”

According to the State Council of Higher Education of Virginia, 32% of undergraduate students in the commonwealth borrowed money during the 2023-2024 school year, which is a decrease from 43% in the 2012-2013 school year.
During the 2023-24 school year, Virginia was awarded $1.4 billion in federal funds, with an average of $11,000 going to each of 131,045 students.
On April 3, the U.S. Department of Education announced it is seeking public feedback on changes to its student aid regulations that “streamline or eliminate unnecessary regulatory processes that are not required by law.”
The agency added that the process should focus on how Title IV regulations have impacted “institutions, states and other partners,” and if implementing certain student aid programs “may be inhibiting innovation and contributing to rising college costs.”
Acting Under Secretary James Bergeron said in an April 3 statement: “Not only will this rule making serve as an opportunity to identify and cut unnecessary red tape, but it will allow key stakeholders to offer suggestions to streamline and improve federal student aid programs.”
According to Federal Student Aid, an office in the Department of Education, the office provides more than $111 billion in federal student aid each year through grants, loans and work-study, which allows students at participating schools to earn money to pay for tuition, books and housing.
Virginians commonly apply for assistance by completing the FAFSA, which has recently been overhauled and faced criticism for its delays, or the VASA application to their preferred institution. 
State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, told the Mercury she anticipates hearing from her constituents soon about the proposed changes as students and families begin applying for federal financial aid for the fall semester. 
“So many of our students depend absolutely on Pell Grants (and) on the federal loans in order to have access to higher education,” Hashmi said, “and so with the wholesale firing of so many employees in the Department of Education, the ability of that department to be efficient and effective in processing these applications is on the line.” 
Hashmi said she’s also concerned that staff cuts at the U.S. Department of Education could negatively impact the agency’s ability to handle issues “as they come up” for those seeking assistance. Some of the applicants seeking assistance are first-generation and low-income students.
One of the most controversial programs being considered for a change is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives the student loan balances of borrowers who make 10 years of payments and hold public service jobs, such as working for the government or a nonprofit.
On March 7, President Donald Trump directed the agency to review the program through an executive order claiming former President Joe Biden’s administration “abused” the program by using taxpayer funds to pay off employee loans before they were up. The order said the previous administration also “misdirected” tax dollars into “activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”
However, critics have argued the administration has instead targeted nonprofit organizations that focus on assisting immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community.

“Threatening to punish hardworking Americans for their employers’ perceived political views is about as flagrant a violation of the First Amendment as you can imagine,” said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense, in a March statement. “If the Trump administration follows through on this threat, they can plan to see us in court.”  
Trump also wrote in the order that individuals employed by organizations whose activities have a “substantial illegal purpose” shall not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness.
The education department will also be taking feedback to improve the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, which allows students to pay back what is owed on a fixed monthly plan over 12 years, adjusted based on their income or 20% of the extra money.
With the threats to overhaul education, including cuts to research institutions, Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said the idea of changing financial aid regulations is concerning for students. 
Financial aid offices at various colleges and universities are charged with processing applications and creating aid packages. But, with the FAFSA issues, administrators have already been frustrated with the delays.
Rasoul said this is going to create a “bureaucratic mess for our students and universities as we move forward.”
Hashmi added, “This is really, really concerning, and it is going to create a tidal wave of concerns for not just the students, but for our colleges and universities and especially in those institutions that have large populations of students who come with federal financial aid.”
The agency will hold an in-person meeting on April 29 and a virtual hearing on May 1. Public comments must be submitted through the Federal eRulemaking Portal.
As of April 14, 285 comments have been submitted to the Federal Register. The deadline for comments is May 5.

In 2010, San Francisco became the first city in the nation to pass a law to control giving away free toys with unhealthy meals for children. (Photo by David Paul Morris/Getty Images)Kids’ menus may serve up smaller portions, but smaller doesn’t always mean healthier.
A piece of legislation recently heard in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly would set nutritional standards for restaurants that serve kids’ meals by capping calories, sodium, added sugars, and fats. The default drink included with a children’s meal would be water, milk or a milk substitute.
Sen. Pam Lauria, the bill’s sponsor and a Barrington Democrat, told her colleagues at an April 10 hearing of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services that the Healthy Kids Act isn’t meant to limit what businesses can do, but instead aims to improve families’ access to more nutritious meals for their kids. 
“Parents are very busy,” Lauria said. “There are sports, there are activities, and frequently they need to feed their children on the fly, and they will frequent a restaurant to help them to do that.”
The bill would give parents more “healthy options,” Lauria said, by specifying each restaurant with a kids’ menu serve at least two qualifying meals. A healthy kid’s meal per the bill’s definition has no more than 550 calories, 700 milligrams of sodium, and 15 grams of added sugars. A maximum 10% of calories would come from saturated fat, and no trans fats would be allowed. Portions would need to include at least two of five food groups, with one of them being a fruit or non-fried vegetable. 
The remaining kids’ meals would not need to follow these standards, and the default beverage choices could also be swapped out at the customer’s request. 
“What this bill does not do is stop restaurants from serving anything else that they want for children,” Lauria said to the Senate committee. “Kids can still have a hot dog if it’s on the menu, kids can still have chicken nuggets if they’re on the menu. Kids can still have a soda if they prefer, if their parents allow. This [bill] just says that we have to acknowledge that we need healthy options available, and that the healthy options should probably be default, particularly when it comes to sugary drinks.”
On the House side, the Healthy Kids Act is sponsored by Rep. Susan Donovan, a Bristol Democrat, and has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing. 
Lauria said that the bill was spurred by the “heartbreaking” prevalence of obesity among Rhode Island kids. According to the 2024 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook, Rhode Island ranks last place in New England for the number of children ages 10 to 17 that are overweight or obese, accounting for 35% of that demographic. Rhode Island ranks 39th on this same metric nationally, according to the factbook. There are also racial disparities in these numbers, the factbook noted: In 2022, 17% of Hispanic children ages 2 to 17 were overweight and 32% were obese, and 16% of non-Hispanic Black children were overweight and 28% were obese.

Doctors showed up to support the bill last week in the Senate, including Dr. Amy Nunn, CEO of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute and a professor at Brown University. 
The proposal is “just a common sense bill that promotes healthy opportunities for kids,” Nunn said. “Our obesity rates are nearly on par with states in the Deep South…Our children, our Hispanic children in Rhode Island, fare 49th in terms of lifetime health and education achievements. Those statistics are breathtaking.”
Nunn said the bill was about making accessible the kinds of meals “you would want to put in front of your children. Nobody wants their kids to be eating supersized food.” 
Dr. Philip Chan, also of the Public Health Institute and a primary care physician with Brown University Health, framed the bill as a preemptive measure to reduce chronic disease rates and health problems seen in Rhode Island’s adult population.  
“These behaviors start in childhood, right? So we have to start there in terms of addressing them,” Chan told senators. “You can have the chicken nuggets, you can have the lemonade or soda every once in a while, but have a vegetable, have a fruit. This is the thing that we try to teach our children. A lot of times you can’t find veggies or fruit on the menu. You have to order it specially made.”
Hamburger Happy Meal qualifies
The push to legislate healthier kids’ menus is not new. An April 2024 roundup by the Center for Science in the Public Interest found over 30 jurisdictions have laws governing children’s meals. The majority of these laws regulate the default beverage to push kids away from soda or other sugary drinks. Nutrition-based laws — ones closer to Rhode Island’s current proposal — are largely found in county-level governments, many of them in Maryland. Statewide initiatives in California, Hawaii, Delaware and Illinois have focused on beverages. 
Before the Senate committee, Nunn referenced these efforts, saying, “The data and studies around these bills show that they have had demonstrable impacts on improving healthy eating behaviors among kids and among people of color. So the science around all of this is really sound, and it really hasn’t had a huge detrimental impact on restaurants.”










You can have the chicken nuggets, you can have the lemonade or soda every once in a while, but have a vegetable, have a fruit.


– Dr. Philip Chan, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at Brown University


Industry giants like McDonald’s have had enough time to change and accommodate the trend. The fast food juggernaut at first took a subversive approach to regulations, like in 2011 when McDonald’s locations in San Francisco started selling Happy Meal toys for 10 cents to get around a municipal law banning toys’ inclusion with unhealthy meals. But by 2014, McDonald’s had started to retool its menu, and in 2018 announced all of its kids’ meals would max out at 600-calories by 2022.
Today, a hamburger Happy Meal would satisfy the requirements of Rhode Island’s Healthy Kids Act. The cheeseburger Happy Meal, however, would not, as it exceeds pretty much every threshold specified in the bill (as well as McDonald’s previously stated goal, as it has 690 calories).
As for the enforceability of the proposed law, the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) would be charged with ensuring compliance. The bill text prescribes the health department to issue relevant rules and regulations, supply multilingual signage and outreach materials for restaurants, and check that restaurants are training staff properly and maintaining documentation about their meals’ compliance.  
But Dr. Jerome “Jerry” Larkin, the health department’s director, wrote in a testimony that those duties are easier said than done.   
The department “applauds the intent of the proposed legislation, which is to establish and enforce environmental food changes to address rising childhood obesity and associated chronic disease emergence in Rhode Island,” Larkin wrote. “However, RIDOH would not be able to implement the provisions outlined in the bill without adequate resources.” 
The department would need another full-time position to enforce the bill, Larkin wrote — specifically, a “grade 27” full-time, nutritionist position that would cost $116,544 a year, with that salary expected to increase in future years. 
Rolling out content like signage, plus tracking and analyzing compliance, would cost about $1,850 in the first year, Larkin wrote. The proposed cost for an extra nutritionist comes at a time when the department is still reconciling the recent loss of $31 million in federal grant money, as well as the potential loss of dozens of existing full-time staff.   
The Senate committee voted to hold Lauria’s bill for further study, the typical procedure for a bill at its first hearing.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fabian Schmidt, a German-American man living in Nashua, was returning home from a visit to Luxembourg on March 7 when he was detained by immigration officials at Boston Logan International Airport in early March and taken to a detention center in Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
Schmidt’s family said that, upon his detainment, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, and violently interrogated, according to a press release from attorney David Keller. He was also reportedly being denied his medications for anxiety and depression, and being given little food and water as officials pressured him to relinquish his green card.
His mother, Astrid Senior, told NBC News that she doesn’t know why her son was being held.
“I feel helpless, absolutely helpless,” she told the news broadcaster.
Schmidt has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager and has legal permanent resident status, according to the family. Court records in California, where he previously lived, show that he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. However, his family said those issues had been resolved in the courts and are no longer ongoing.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — have not provided a justification for Schmidt’s detainment. They have, however, denied the allegations that he was violently interrogated.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
Schmidt has a court date scheduled in June in Boston.
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said her office, in collaboration with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s office, has inquired within DHS and spoken with Schmidt’s family. She declined to speak on the issue during an event Monday, and said she is “honoring the wishes of the family and their legal advisers.”
“We are in touch with Homeland Security and Mr. Schmidt’s family, but we are also respecting their privacy,” Hassan said. “There’s ongoing litigation about it, so we will respect the privacy but we continue to be in touch with them.”
She would not say whether she knows the justification for his detainment.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Part of a broader Trump administration strategy
Schmidt is not the only legal U.S. immigrant to be part of a high profile legal battle over their immigration status. President Donald Trump, who made cracking down on immigration and mass deportation central tenets of his campaign in 2024, and his administration have launched a public campaign of deportations and detainments that have been decried as illegal and unethical after being reported by the press.
In one of the highest profile immigration-related incidents, Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and an Algerian citizen with permanent legal resident status in the U.S., was arrested by ICE officials in his New York City apartment on March 8, one day after Schmidt was detained. Khalil, who was born to Palestinian parents in a refugee enclave in Syria before ultimately immigrating to the U.S. and marrying a citizen, was an organizer of protests on Columbia University’s campus against the Israeli occupation and military action in Gaza. The State Department is currently attempting to revoke his legal status in the country and deport him as punishment for his role in the protests, a move that has generated an uproar among progressives and immigration advocates who believe Khalil has a protected right to free speech. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil engaged in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which foster a hostile environment for Jewish students in the U.S.” On Friday, a judge in Louisiana ruled that the State Department can deport Khalil. A federal court in New Jersey is expected to hear further appeals in the case. 
Several other university students who protested Israel’s war in Gaza have also been targeted by the Trump administration. 
Tufts University Ph.D. student Rümeysa Öztürk, from Turkey with a student visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 in Somerville, Mass. Video of her arrest, which shows six agents in plain clothes, some of whom were obscuring their badges or wearing hoods or face coverings, went viral online and sparked furor. While federal officials have not publicly provided justification for her arrest, Öztürk was the author of a 2024 op-ed in the university’s student newspaper calling for the university to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Hamas was not mentioned in the op-ed. 
Another Columbia University student, Yunseo Chung, an undergraduate student who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7 and is a permanent legal resident, was another target of ICE after the administration attempted to deport her over her involvement in the pro-Palesintian protests. However, the administration has been so far unsuccessful in deporting the woman, who was born in South Korea, amid a legal battle. Rubio, in a press conference last month, said the Trump administration has revoked over 300 visas of students who have engaged in pro-Palestine protest activity.
The Trump administration has also moved to purge Venezuelan and other Latin American migrants from the country under the auspices that they have connections to the violent Tren de Aragua  and MS-13 gangs. In March, the Trump administration flew 238 men to El Salvador with no due process. There, they are being detained in a notorious mega prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known for brutal conditions and under the control of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has described himself as “world’s coolest dictator.” The administration reportedly used some of the men’s tattoos and clothing as the sole evidence of their gang affiliations. However, an analysis of those deportees by CBS News found no criminal records for 179, or roughly 75%, of them.
That includes Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran citizen who’s lived in Maryland for 15 years. Even after admitting in court it deported him due to “administrative error,” the Trump administration refuses to bring Ábrego García back to the U.S., saying it is up to Salvadoran officials to decide his fate. This is despite the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return to the country. In an appearance at the White House Monday, Bukele said he would not return Ábrego García, calling the idea “preposterous” and asking, “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?”
Those deported also include a makeup artist who immigrated from Venezuela to California in August named Andry Hernandez Romero. He had no criminal record, no known gang affiliation, and was undergoing the asylum process after fleeing his country over fears he would be persecuted for being gay and his political beliefs, according to his lawyers. Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in these Salvadoran deportations. The move has been criticized for refusing to give the men due process and for its brutality. Rubio said Sunday that another 10 people have been sent to El Salvador. 
On Friday, Trump authorized the military to take control of land along the southern border. His announced plan is to station military troops there to detain immigrants traveling into the country from Mexico. He has also previously declared a national emergency arguing “America’s sovereignty is under attack” and that the border is “overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/schmidtrally-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:59:35.749634

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A provision in the version of the two-year state budget passed by Ohio House Republicans would eliminate elected members from the State Board of Education. This comes after the last budget stripped the board of most of its power.
Final Ohio education budget expands vouchers, limits board of ed powers

The budget passed by the House last week would reduce the board membership from 11 elected members and eight governor-appointed members to five, all appointed by the governor.
When the terms of the current elected board members expire or the positions become vacant in another way, the seats would be eliminated. Three of the governor-appointed spots would also.
The House budget also changes the requirements for appointed board members to require “at least one member to represent each of a rural, suburban, and urban school district, a community school and a chartered nonpublic school.”
According to budget documents, the reduction would save Ohio about $50,000. Board members received an average of $3,500 in compensation in 2024, according to state data.
The budget is now in the hands of the Senate.
The House changes come along with a proposal that public education advocates say would cut public school funding and eliminate the Fair School Funding model that has been in place for the last four years. The existing model calls for $666 million, but the House budget would cut that by roughly two-thirds, to $226 million.
The board’s budget could be coming from a separate fund, rather than its own licensure fund on which it’s been relying since the last budget cycle limited their power within the state education system.
With the establishment of the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce two years ago, the board’s powers were largely stripped away and what powers remained were centered on teacher licensure and territorial disputes. It was strongly opposed by board members and members of  the public.
The last two years have been a financial struggle after the change to the teacher licensure fund as well. Superintendent of Public Instruction Paul Craft came to legislators with funding requests, telling lawmakers and the board that the uncertainty of the teacher licensure fund could harm the board’s bottom line, when staffing and expense cuts had been exhausted.

The fund’s revenue surges at certain points of the year, when teachers get or renew their licenses. The rest of the year, the board has to live on the funds provided by the state.
With the start of a new budget cycle, Craft asked for additional state support to help with the costs of annual background checks for school staff. He also asked to eliminate the video assessment portion of the Ohio Teacher Residency Program to save more than $1 million.
The House’s budget eliminates the teacher licensure fund, with the board’s operating expenses paid from the Occupational Licensing and Regulatory Fund. The fund already exists to pay into assistance funds for nursing education, certified public accountant education and veterinary student debt.
A Legislative Service Commission analysis of the budget changes noted that the moving to the occupational licensing fund “may provide greater financial stability” for the board, because that fund “serves as a shared operating fund for many occupational licensing and regulatory boards and commissions.” They are supported by license fees, fines, penalties and “other assessments” put in the fund by those boards and commissions.
The House also added $2 million from the General Revenue Fund in each fiscal year for the educator background check service, called the Retained Applicant Fingerprint Database (or Rapback).
While a spokesperson for the board of education said it was “premature” to comment on the reduction in board members at this point, he said the House changes to the funding, along with the elimination of the video teacher assessment, could mean good things for the board.
“We were actually very happy with the financial side of things,” said board spokesman Alex Goodman.
Appropriations based on the House draft would give the board $16.3 million in fiscal year 2026, and $16.8 million in fiscal year 2027.
A spokesperson for the House majority caucus did not comment on the elimination of elected officials in the budget, but said the funding changes “reflect the recent restructuring of the board’s responsibility for licensing and conduct of educators.”
“Aligning with the funding of nearly all other licensing boards, this shift addresses the long-standing status of the state board as somewhat of an outlier,” said Olivia Wile, caucus press secretary. “It promotes consistency across the system and is expected to be advantageous over time, potentially reducing the pressure for increased licensing fees in the future.”
Goodman said board leaders are already preparing to testify to the Senate the budget process moves to that chamber over the next month.

Ricky Hill, R-Cabot. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A legislative budget committee on Monday pulled down a bill that would have added $250 million to a fund dedicated to prison construction in Arkansas. 
The decision comes less than a week after state lawmakers said a separate $750 million appropriation bill to support construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County appears dead after five failed votes in the Senate. Disputes over the two bills are the latest in a monthslong battle to fund and build a new state penitentiary in the rural western Arkansas county. 
Senate Bill 633 would authorize the addition of $250 million from general revenue to a correctional facilities fund that the Legislature placed $330 million into in 2023. State lawmakers also set aside $75 million in 2022 for expanding the state’s prison capacity, and that money has already been allocated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. 
Republican lawmakers questioned the intent of SB 633 during the Joint Budget Committee’s meeting Monday. Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, asked if the bill was “a backdoor way” to fund the new penitentiary. 
Meanwhile, Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, sought assurances that state officials wouldn’t try to pull money from a separate $350 million miscellaneous appropriation to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration to support prison construction.
“I have no problem moving money into this account, but I think that we need to have a path of where we think we’re going…but what I want to make sure is that it’s not our intention that we’re going to use a large part of that miscellaneous appropriation that we give through DF&A to fund this prison,” Hickey said. 
Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote

Specifically, Hickey asked if the $75 million that’s already been allocated to the corrections department would be used to assess a more detailed cost estimate of the whole project as requested by some state lawmakers. 
Magnolia Republican and Joint Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Lane Jean said the goal is to spend the $75 million first. 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has called for expanding bed capacity at state prisons to alleviate overcrowding in county jails. A lack of space at Arkansas prisons has led to some state inmates being housed in local jails. 
Controversy arose last October when Sanders announced the state purchased 815 acres near Charleston for nearly $3 million as a site to construct a new prison. Local residents and state officials decried the lack of transparency in the decision and have pushed back against the project for months. 
The Arkansas Board of Corrections has moved forward with the project by hiring a construction management company and seeking proposals from architectural firms and contractors. 
Searcy Republican and JBC Vice Chair Sen. Jonathan Dismang recommended removing SB 633 from consideration Monday, noting that the corrections department isn’t likely to use all $75 million before next year’s fiscal session in April when lawmakers could again explore options for funding prison expansion.  
If officials do need additional funding before then, they have the ability to request lawmakers’ approval for a temporary appropriation increase, Dismang said.
“There’s no reason to have a continued debate this morning with where we are in the session,” he said. 
The Arkansas Legislature is scheduled to finish the bulk of its work by Wednesday, before recessing for a few weeks and officially adjourning the legislative session on May 5.

Bruce Skaug started to view it as inevitable that the Gem State would follow suit.
Not anymore.
Skaug, a Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.











Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug



“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
A debate headed for the ballot
In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
Pot smell and safety concerns ignite disputes over public smoking

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.
She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP-controlled statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“I think this is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
Targeting marijuana potency, revenues
In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
Drug decriminalization stumbled in Oregon. Other states are taking note.

“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles just passed the legislature last week. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”
With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the legislature.
The Colorado psychedelic mushroom experiment has arrived

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New England Head Start office closed; federal funding in flux,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/ct-head-start-office-closes/,"Although funding for the early childhood program has not been cut, uncertainty remains about its future. One parent said she is ‘terrified.’","The email popped up in David Morgan’s inbox a couple of weeks ago: an employee at the Head Start Program office in Boston, which covers the New England region, was letting him know it was their last day of work and they would no longer be his point of contact. 
The employee hoped Morgan, who heads up TEAM, Inc, a nonprofit that runs 56 Head Start classrooms, might soon have a new contact with another office, but no further details were provided.
The Boston office was one of five regional offices around the country to be shuttered earlier this month. And although funding for the child care and preschool program has not been cut, uncertainty remains about its future.
“The federal government is not coming to help Connecticut, and we’re beginning to see the signs of how challenging that’s going to be,” Morgan said. 
If the program was to be consolidated, Morgan said, he would understand that, but “this is the most chaotic, foggy way to do it.”
Head Start was created by former President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration to fight poverty by helping low-income children access early childhood education. Since its founding in 1965, the program has served around 40 million children. 
Advocates say that losing Head Start would have a detrimental impact not only on children, who benefit from education, along with meals, vision and dental screenings, but also force scores of parents to leave the workforce. It could also inflict a blow to Gov. Ned Lamont’s goal of creating universal pre-K.
There are 5,718 children currently enrolled in Head Start and Early Head Start in Connecticut, according to the Office of Early Childhood. A child is eligible for the program when their family is at or falls below federal poverty guidelines, if they are a foster child, if they are experiencing homelessness or if they are enrolled in a support service like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Depending on their income, parents pay for the program on a sliding fee scale.
While funding for the program has not yet been cut, Morgan is anxious about whether he will receive word about the program’s next grant by the deadline of May 1 without his usual points of contact. 
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye said that the Head Start regional office also oversaw Care4Kids and Child Care Development Fund grants, and that her office communicated with them once or twice a week. 
“They are some of the smartest people I know, and they stay highly informed on early childhood issues and help us know what other states are doing that works,” Bye said. “I am in utter shock at how undervalued these very skilled professionals are.”  
Now, parents whose children attend the programs are worried about what comes next. 
Meghan Johnson’s 3-year-old daughter attends a Head Start program in Ansonia. 
“She’s growing and blossoming every day,” Johnson said. “Every day she says something new to me and then she’s telling me her teachers taught her that or her friends taught her that.” 
Johnson said before she found the program she was spending half of her paycheck on child care. When she heard that the regional Head Start program’s office had closed, she was “terrified.”
“It’s very scary to wake up every morning and not know (if I’ll have child care), your life is kind of in limbo,” she said. 
Bye pointed out that all of the Head Start offices that were shuttered were located in “blue” states — New York, Washington, Massachusetts, California and Illinois. “It just doesn’t make sense, it makes you think it was not based on any thought process — it was political.”
Recently, Bye saw a USA Today headline indicating that the Trump administration’s proposed budget would eliminate Head Start altogether. But Bye believes the Head Start program will endure because it enjoys bipartisan support.
“It’s hard to fathom how a thinking person would cut Head Start when it’s such a good return on investment,” Bye said. “But even if they tried, I don’t think they can: politically these cuts affect red states more than blue states. Blue states have more of their own infrastructure.”
This year, Bye has been hard at work representing Lamont and his plan to establish universal pre-K in Connecticut. The end of Head Start would be a major setback to that effort. Bye may think that cutting the program is illogical but admits, “we can’t rule that out.”
Morgan said he, too, has hope the program will survive recent rounds of federal cuts. Recently, he got a new point of contact in the Washington, D.C., office. He’s trying not to alarm employees and families. But the uncertainty is taking a toll.
“I cry to my wife every night. There’s nothing fun about any of this,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0414_SR_HeadStart_005-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:00:35.913684

While the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship Program exists to help families afford quality care, administrative red tape has caused this vital resource to be underutilized. 
Recent reports from both the UNH Carsey School of Public Policy and the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute confirm what many families already know: our Child Care Scholarship system is hampered by “substantial paperwork and complicated application processes” that limit its reach and effectiveness. 
In a series of focus groups, participants applying for the Child Care Scholarship said they found the process “particularly complicated,” and reported experiencing “substantial stress” and investing “significant time” in applying. As one parent described the process, “You literally have to have all your ducks in a row for you to even apply.” This parent explained, “You have to have the day care that they’re going to, the hours that they’re going to be, and then you have to have that all set up with your work.” 
Even with all those pieces in place, the parent described a frustrating “runaround” in the application process. “There’s been a few times when I’m, like, OK, what do you need? Do you need blood at this point? Because it’s just like I’ve given you everything at this point.” 
And while going through this process, the parent explained, “You see those [child care] balances adding up and if you miss one thing and they deny [your application], then you have to redo it all over again hoping that [the child care provider won’t say] you need to pay this until they can reimburse us.”
Our state lawmakers have the power to remove unnecessary barriers Child Care Scholarship participants have experienced. 
Senate Bill 243, for example, would create a pilot program for “presumptive eligibility,” allowing families who meet basic screening criteria to receive up to 60 days of scholarship funding while their full application is processed. This addresses a critical gap during which families could have to delay the start of a job while waiting for scholarship approval. Parents should not have to turn down employment opportunities because they can’t afford child care while their paperwork is being processed. 
The bill would also require a study of the application process itself. In recent listening sessions across the state, New Futures learned that families applying for Child Care Scholarship funding face time-consuming requests for information and documentation, often beyond what’s needed to determine eligibility for the scholarship program. Blended or foster families, parents with disabilities that exempt them from the program’s work requirements, families with limited technology, and families with a primary language other than English can face additional hurdles in the application process. This study will ensure eligible families aren’t unreasonably discouraged from participating in the program. 
And, the bill aligns scholarship processes with the realities of modern child care businesses. Currently, providers waste valuable time reporting detailed attendance data despite the fact that payments are now based on enrollment, not attendance. The legislation would streamline these processes and also create a system of up-front payments for child care providers — just as they receive from non-scholarship families — offering greater economic stability and encouraging more providers to accept scholarship families. 
Such updates to the Child Care Scholarship program would address problems that are preventing an existing program from reaching its full potential. The benefits of these improvements would extend far beyond administrative convenience. When more families can access the scholarship program, more children receive quality care linked to positive developmental outcomes, child care businesses receive much-needed support, and parents can participate more fully in our state’s workforce. And importantly, the federal government more than matches every state dollar spent on the program. 
At a time when child care costs are crushing family budgets and limiting our workforce, we can’t afford to let administrative barriers restrict access to this important program. 
Cora Hoppe, the executive director of the Rochester Child Care Center, has noted that when families secure a scholarship: “The sense of relief is huge. I don’t see parents coming in panicked about paying their bill or afraid to see me. [Parents] can build better relationships with the teachers and administration because they’re not worried about [paying their bill].” 
The New Hampshire Legislature has an opportunity to make our Child Care Scholarship program work as intended — supporting children, families, providers, and our economy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/childcareredtape-1024x682.png,,,2025-04-15 05:00:35.913684

(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Communications Workers of America (CWA))In an Ohio visit Monday, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-CA, critiqued and offered a counterpoint the Trump administration.
At the City Club of Cleveland, he argued the president’s campaign tapped into genuine grievances in cities that saw jobs move overseas, “but they offer no hopeful vision, no real solutions for the future.”
Khanna jabbed Trump about “conquering” Greenland and building a fortress out of tariffs, but added, “you simply can’t have James Polk’s expansionism, and William McKinley’s protectionism, and expect to win in the 21st century.”
Polk’s administration annexed territory from Texas to Washington in the 1840s, at the cost of a war with Mexico, and heightened tensions between slave and free states. McKinley’s calling card in in Congress and as president was protectionism, although even he was having second thoughts when he was assassinated.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Khanna described the Trump administration’s tariff strategy as a disastrous self-inflicted wound. Instead of lashing out at other nations, U.S. leaders should be investing in companies that could be the economic engine of their communities.
Khanna termed this “economic patriotism” with lofty comparisons to the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe following World War II. But the more recent example was the CHIPS Act. Khanna argued the federal investment in companies like Intel yielded more than ten times as much in private dollars.
“We can do this for other industries,” he argued, “and we can do it in factory towns across this country.”
The benefit isn’t just improving the local tax base. He contends that economic development might begin to repair our politics. It’s difficult to despair when there are plenty of job opportunities, and a growing community breeds a sense of collective purpose.
But even as Khanna offered a collaborative vision for the future, the more competitive subtext was difficult to miss. At every turn, he emphasized Vice President J.D. Vance’s role shaping policy and rhetoric.
With President Trump constitutionally barred from a third term, Vance appears to be the party’s heir apparent. Khanna’s Midwest swing could be a campaign rehearsal — his effort to contrast his own vision against Vance’s hints at his own 2028 ambitions.
What attendees wanted to know
After speaking for about half an hour, several City Club attendees asked about several issues including immigration and economic policy.
On immigration, Khanna emphasized due process.
“I’m all for deporting people who have been convicted of violent crimes,” he said. “I just want to make sure we know whether they actually committed the violent crimes in the first place.”
Supreme Court says Trump administration must ‘facilitate’ return of wrongly deported man

Former Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera, who lives in Shaker Heights, asked about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador.
Khanna said if the Trump administration defies the Supreme Court order to facilitate Garcia’s return, that would precipitate a constitutional crisis. He pointed to Vance’s statements encouraging the president to ignore court orders.
“Even if you believe that people convicted of heinous crimes, as I do, should be deported, even if you believe that MS-13 gang members should be deported, you have to speak up for due process,” he said. “And even if you don’t agree with the due process, you have to speak up for listening to a Supreme Court in this country — the whole system depends on that.”
Other attendees asked if there’s really an appetite for rebuilding former factory towns among voters in places like Silicon Valley, which Khanna represents. And even if the political will exists, how do you avoid the red tape that has plagued industrial policy like the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure law?
Khanna acknowledged that permitting has been a problem but it’s only one challenge. Permitting reform is “not going to magically redevelop Ashtabula County,” he argued. Federal financing to train workers and support businesses will be necessary. And he said there’s a long tradition of pairing private and public investment stretching back to Alexander Hamilton.
“If we inspire the American public with a common mission,” Khanna said, “we will overcome the propaganda and the anger and the falseness of what Trump and Vance are selling.”
“People are angry. That’s why they’re looking for alternatives,” he added. “We need to inspire them with a real one.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)A former public official and an investment firm are defending themselves after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine spoke out about their conversations after our reporting exposed their close relationship.
Former retired teachers’ pension fund board member Wade Steen argued that nothing was inappropriate about his behavior, claiming the governor should be the one being looked into.
In an exclusive one-on-one interview, the governor finally addressed the alleged corruption scheme plaguing the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS).
The day after that sit-down, I spoke with Steen and Seth Metcalf, the head of QED, the investment firm at the center of the scandal.
For the past year, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), a roughly $100 billion pension fund for the more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers around former board member Wade Steen, board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum, and their relationship with investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
This piece will be formatted as a Q&A, as it features moments from the 15-minute interview. It has been lightly edited only for clarity and length, as well as to get to the crux of the comment.
How we got here
In May 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them.
They couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents said.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money — through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA, the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, had worked together, specifically when it comes to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been doing the bidding of QED.
The AG states that the pair should be removed because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and trust when “colluding” with QED.
In late August, Yost filed several subpoenas against QED and others allegedly involved in this scheme. The same month, QED spoke out to us for the first time, and so did the AG.
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of my investigations.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Texts between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel show that the pair consistently worked together. There are hundreds of text messages.
Texts show a group chat between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel. The pair constantly texted Steen during board meetings with advice, including numerous messages of “Vote!” and “Force the vote” when it came to policy and following QED.
“Thanks for the support today!” Steen said.
“Wade – you are a champion! We moved the ball down the field today and have time to recoup and refresh during the holiday!” Metcalf texted the group.

Our reporting stunned the governor, he said, so after more than a year of requesting an interview with him, he agreed to a date in April 2025.
Steen, QED, STRS responds to the governor
Morgan Trau: “There’s still a lot of support for you from the STRS board and from the pensioners. How do you feel now that there is still this support for reform?”
Wade Steen: “I’m happy that there’s support for reform. Everything I tried to do when I was on the board was restore [cost of living adjustments]. It was a benefit that was taken away… If I in any way contributed to getting that conversation started about how do we do a better job for the teachers in Ohio, I feel satisfied that I made a little bit of a difference.”
Originally appointed by former Gov. John Kasich, he was reappointed by DeWine when the governor started his administration, but the governor asked him to resign in 2023. Steen refused, so DeWine removed him. DeWine originally cited Steen’s alleged poor attendance at board meetings as reasoning.
However, a court ruled that DeWine did not have the legal authority to remove Steen based on Ohio law, and thus, Steen was put back on the board in the spring 2024.
I asked the governor during our interview why he had removed Steen, to which he reiterated that his attendance was unsatisfactory. Steen disagreed. However, I pressed DeWine on his updated statement from May 2024, months after the removal, in which his team said that there were concerns about Steen’s involvement with QED.
Trau: “Do you find that suspicious that he’s changing his mind now or do you think that this was always something that he was worried about? What do you take from that change?”
Steen: “I don’t know what I would take. When I got a call from his staff person… her comment, and it’s noted in numerous disclosures, was, ‘We want to go in a different direction.’ Didn’t say who ‘we’ was, and I asked what direction that was because I reiterated that I had met with the governor’s chief of staff just a few months prior, and the staff were very aware of what I was doing and what I was fighting for — which was for teachers. I said, ‘I don’t understand what’s this different direction?’ Never once did I get that answered. So if anything’s hung in the back of my mind, it’s ‘they wanted to go in a different direction.'”
On his removal, he notes that the governor and Yost argue that “they want the same things I was fighting for, which is shocking.”
Steen: “They want to restore cost of living, they want to improve performance, they want to make sure that the fund is doing the best job possible for teachers. I thought, ‘Wow, that’s exactly what I say,’ but they wanted to go in a different direction? Why the argument from attendance to something else, I don’t know. When my attendance was pulled, they found out that it was actually very good, and better than many, so, maybe they had to come up with a different reason… My attendance was never a problem, when I saw that I was a little surprised.”
I brought up to DeWine how Steen was removed during a critical election when the reformers took control of the board, and then he released the 14-page memo during another pivotal election when the reformers took a supermajority of the board. With this dominance, they would be able to start shifting the investment structure, something that reformers claim DeWine wants to prevent.
Throughout the past year, I’ve spoken to Steen about this — in which he argues that the governor wants to prevent true reform. Steen’s supporters say the removal was to “silence” him.
The governor insists he has no reason to stop reform, but rather, he wants to stop possibly corrupt activity. The texts paint a picture between Steen and Metcalf that was “disconcerting,” DeWine said.
Hundreds of texts show Metcalf gave Steen questions to ask during board meetings, documents to propose, and pushed him to follow QED’s plan.
“I think we can win this but I need to nuisance it,” Steen texted in 2020, as he was pitching QED’s proposal.
“I think you’ve got the votes! Make the motion! Announce that you have a solution,” Metcalf responded.
Metcalf continually texted talking points, themes and direct quotes for Steen to follow while he was in the board meetings.
Steen followed his lead.
Trau: “Do you think that they were appropriate?”
Steen: “Absolutely. I had conversations not just with Seth Metcalf, but with numerous people. Part of my job as a board member is to try to get information, know as much as I can. And as has been documented and you noted, I knew Seth from years prior — we go to the same church… So for me to try to better understand what’s going on or ask people’s opinion — whether it would be our staff, whether it be Seth Metcalf as an individual, whether it would be other people that are in the investment field that I know that never get mentioned — I didn’t find that unusual.”
He doesn’t know why his relationship with Metcalf was “the focus,” he added.
Steen: “I ask a lot of people a lot of questions. The question I would have is, if you read the letter, the anonymous letter, from 2021 on, information had been provided by STRS staff to the attorney general. So for more than three years, they’ve been getting all kinds of information. Nothing in the letter is new, and yet here we sit a year after the attorney general made allegations and brought charges, and there’s nothing — because there is nothing, there’s no merit to it. It’s almost weaponization… But clearly, if there was something, I would think in three years you would have some evidence. They clearly have none other than ‘He spoke to this person.’ OK, well, I spoke to a lot of people.'”
He was removed in 2023, so he missed some time, and then was not reappointed — so he has begun to “move on,” he added.
Steen: “I feel like I did make a small contribution toward fighting for teacher benefits for retirees and trying to improve benefits in the future for active teachers not receiving them yet. I take some satisfaction in that, but my term’s done.”
He is focused on his job as chief financial officer of the Cleveland Metroparks and spending time with his grandchildren, he added.
Steen: “I really haven’t thought much about it since then, other than when we have to file something in the court because these cases, as I understand, drag on for some period of time.”
I brought up how the governor pointed out that QED was specifically trying to get a job.
Trau: “QED was specifically trying to get money for their startup to be able to work with you and work with STRS on investing. That’s where he says it crosses a line.”
Steen: “I don’t know how to respond to that. I guess that the issue that I kept raising — I think everybody keeps missing — is that we have non-disclosure agreements with numerous groups that we make investments with, and I have been outspoken that there needs to be transparency, and yet no one, governor, AG, staff seem to be concerned about the fact that… investment staff make investments and the board does not know the details of those investments and are not provided when asked, they are denied access to that information.
He continued.
Steen: “And so, Morgan, I’d ask you as a reporter — does that concern you? That was really the crux of what started so much of this was, ‘What are our fees with the hedge funds? What is in the agreements?’ and at every turn I was denied, denied, denied. That’s all I wanted — I wanted transparency. I want to know what are we investing in, who’s benefiting from this?”
He was roadblocked on numerous occasions from trying to get information on investments from staff and information on how bonuses are given to staff members. Other information he wanted falls under different types of trade information and, thus, isn’t disclosed.
Steen: “I don’t want to say something is there because I don’t know — I don’t know what’s there because we were never provided. I was never provided that information.”
When it comes to Metcalf, he denied knowing whether they fully wanted a job.
Steen: “Whether or not QED was trying to get work, I guess people could say they were. I was intrigued by the idea.”
Going on to say that in the 14-page memo, staff acknowledged they do something similar to QED’s idea, so this wasn’t out of the realm of the norm. I could not substantiate that through my multiple readings of the memo. The closest thing I found to that is the staff noting that it “was familiar with the use of similar strategies on a much smaller scale but was not aware they could achieve anywhere near the results suggested.”
The former board member said that the investing didn’t have to be with QED; he was just wondering if the “idea has merit,” he said.
Steen: “I was pushing for more performance… I wanted our expenses done and I wanted our results better. That’s what I think every oversight body should do — how do we do better? What ideas can we take from others and implement here. But, if that’s the assertion — that I was trying to secure work for one person, that’s not accurate. I wanted to know more about this idea. Was there merit? But the bigger idea was ‘How do we restore cola for our retirees?’ How do we restore benefits that were taken away from them? How do we do better time and again?”
He was removed for questioning the staff, he said.
Steen: “If someone tries to remove me, if someone tries to attack me because I’m asking how we do better, I guess I’ll wear that because If I were on the board today, I would continue to say, ‘How do we do better for teachers.’ You’ve watched the meetings and you’ve been around, Morgan, long enough to know and see the questions I asked. I was pretty direct on my question about how do we do better? I think sometimes that made staff uncomfortable that they were being held into account, whether it be staff or consultants about how do we do better — they didn’t really have a good answer.”
I referenced how Steen said he would speak to multiple people for advice. In reference to Metcalf, he asked for edits on documents; he was given “themes” to bring up during meetings.
Trau: “How would you categorize or characterize that relationship?”
Steen: “Probably nothing more than input, like I would get through reading information, calling people that I know that do institutional investments in town for private sector pension funds and others — just personal friends. ‘Hey, what do you guys think about this? What do you think about that idea? What do you think about the way we pay our bonus structure,’ that kind of thing… So those are the kind of things that people would tell me that just raised questions for me.”
He continued.
Steen: “But to your question, how would I categorize? Just someone I bounce an idea off of like anyone else. People would send me their thoughts, talk to me, go have coffee… I spent a lot of time trying to really understand what we were doing, what we were tasked with. I was really trying to do my job as a board member. But back to my relationship — it would be one where I was just seeking input or advice. That was all.”
Trau: “Were you talking with other people during board meetings that were giving you direct quotes to say or they were giving you ideas on motions?”
Steen: “No, I wasn’t — I didn’t — no, no.”
Then we got on the topic of DeWine’s history with text messages.
Now-indicted FirstEnergy executives allegedly worked with DeWine and his team to pass legislation that was the result of the largest corruption scheme in state history, according to newly released text messages. DeWine denies knowing House Bill 6 was a bribe.
A public records request reveals that DeWine communicated frequently during his first run for governor with former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones and VP Michael Dowling.
The pair held lavish fundraisers before he was elected, with Jones giving speeches about how DeWine would be great for “his company and shareholders,” a speech I received said. Plus, Jones provided the now-governor money when he asked.
“Chuck. Can you call me?” DeWine wrote on Oct. 13, 2018 — less than a month before he faced off against Democrat Rich Cordray in the governor’s race. “OEA put in million yesterday for Cordray.”
“OK,” Jones responded. “I’ll call at 2:30.”
Three days later, Dowling texted Jones and said, “Chuck — go ahead and call Mike DeWine on the $500k. It’s going to RGA’s C(4) called state solutions. All set.”
Jones responds, “OK. I’ll call him around 5.”
I explained to Steen how DeWine said the conversations were very different because FirstEnergy was just helping DeWine in an “individual” sense, whereas QED wants a job. Click here to read more of the governor’s stance.
Steen didn’t want to fully comment without knowing the entire quotation but did critique the governor — as many reformers do regarding the H.B. 6 scandal.
Steen: “I think they’re even more different in that his relationship with Chuck Jones is much different. He was getting something from Chuck Jones. Chuck Jones gave him a campaign contribution. I got nothing. Again, three years of investigation. The assertion was ‘Wade had a relationship.’ The assertion was ‘Wade got something.’ The assertion was something was offered. Morgan, unless I’ve missed it, none of that’s true. There’s no evidence to that. The governor got a campaign contribution from First Energy, correct?”


Trau: “Got a few.”


Steen: “Yeah, so if there is a difference — he got something… They are quite different. He’s the governor. I’m a volunteer board member — just who we are in our positions is a lot different, too. I mean, the amount of authority and power one has, he’s the governor, he got campaign contributions. I’m just a volunteer board member trying to work hard for teachers. It’s interesting how, somehow, one’s volunteer service somehow becomes this negative — that they have to wear this attack upon them. I guess the better question is why the attack upon me? Because I talked to one person? If you think about it and step back and and view it through that lens — why were they after this person so much?”
Trau: “Why do you think?”
Steen: “I’m not at liberty to say because our cases are still pending, but things are still moving forward.”
What Steen didn’t acknowledge was the fact that he has received thousands of dollars to fight his legal battle against not just his original removal from the board, but also the AG’s lawsuit.
Robin Rayfield, who runs ORTA, put together a fund in 2023 to pay Steen’s fees.
“I communicated with Wade,” Rayfield said in an interview with me in May 2024. “I said, ‘Well, do you wanna fight this?’ And he goes, ‘Let me think about it because fighting the governor is a tough thing to do…’ But nonetheless, we stood with Wade and I said, ‘Well, ORTA could potentially help you fight this.”
Case Western Reserve University business law professor Eric Chaffee explained that this raises red flags.
“If you have certain benefits being paid to an individual, who’s supposed to represent a complete group of people, from a segment of that group of people, it creates concerns that there are going to be policies that favor them,” Chaffee said.
Last year, I obtained thank you cards that Steen wrote to pensioners for donating to his legal fund, adding that the “generous financial contribution” will allow him to “deliver” for teachers.
ORTA leader Robin Rayfield told me they ended up raising more than $80,000 for Steen — but they recently started fundraising for Fichtenbaum due to the AG’s lawsuit involving him as well as Steen.
In September, ORTA finally filled out the lobbying expenditures requirement. It showed that, in total, they spent about $115,000 to support the two men. About $87,000 went to Steen, and $27,000 went to Fichtenbaum.
“In 23 years of reviewing lobbying expenditures, this is a complete outlier — we’ve seen nothing comparable,” Legislative Inspector General Tony Bledsoe told me during our report exposing the money.
This means both Steen and Fichtenbaum, the chair, are using donations from a section of members to pay their legal fees.
After telling me he had to get onto another call, abruptly ending the interview, Steen added that the H.B. 6 scandal should be the story to focus on.
I was able to squeeze in one final question.
Trau: “Are you interested in going back on the board or being executive director or CIO?”
Steen: “No, I’m very happy in what I’m doing here at the Metroparks.”
Metcalf declined an interview but did provide a statement.
“I’m grateful this matter is now in a court of law, where the evidence will show that QED’s interactions with the STRS board were lawful, ethical and appropriate,” Metcalf emailed. “Whistleblowers Steen and Fichtenbaum collaborated with QED to unravel a web of misinformation and expose a system enriching STRS employees at the expense of Ohio educators.”
I also reached out to the STRS team to ask them how they viewed the conversations between Steen and QED.
Their spokesperson told me they don’t comment on pending litigation, but provided a copy of their ethics policy, which includes provisions stating that no one on the board can “Vote, authorize, recommend, or in any other way use his or her position to secure approval of a Board or System contract (including employment or personal services) in which the Board Member or employee, a family member, or anyone with whom the Board Member or employee has a business or employment relationship, has an interest; Solicit or accept any compensation, except as allowed by law, to perform his or her official duties or any act or service in his or her official capacity; Solicit or accept anything of value from anyone doing business with the Board or System.”
There is no evidence of any kickbacks, Steen and QED argue, so this wouldn’t apply.

Here’s what communities are losing.,Nada Hassanein,,,,,https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2025/04/15/trump-has-canceled-environmental-justice-grants-heres-what-communities-are-losing/,"Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Trump administration has canceled environmental justice-related grants, including one CleanAIRE NC received to install air quality monitors. (Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems, and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits, and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts, and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing, and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.
CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

Mike DeWine is deeply concerned following a recent report in which we revealed hundreds of text messages of the relationship between a public official and an investment firm seeking to get access to tens of billions of dollars from the state. In an exclusive one-on-one interview, the governor finally addressed the alleged corruption scheme plaguing the retired teachers’ pension fund.
“You’re still on this story, huh?” the governor said to me as we were getting started with our 30-minute interview. “While others have lost attention — you stayed on it.”
For the past year, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), a roughly $100 billion pension fund for the more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers around former board member Wade Steen, board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum, and their relationship with investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
This piece will be formatted as a Q&A, featuring moments from the half-hour interview. It has been lightly edited only for clarity and length, as well as to get to the crux of the comment.
Wade Steen and Seth Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them.
They couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and also because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents say.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money — through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA, the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, had worked together, specifically when it comes to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
The AG states that the pair should be removed because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and trust when “colluding” with QED.
In late August, Yost filed several subpoenas against QED and others allegedly involved in this scheme. The same month, QED spoke out to us for the first time, and so did the AG.
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of my investigations.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Texts between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel show that the pair consistently worked together. There are hundreds of text messages.
Texts show a group chat between Steen, Metcalf and Tremmel. The pair constantly texted Steen during board meetings with advice, including numerous messages of “Vote!” and “Force the vote” when it came to policy and following QED.
“Thanks for the support today!” Steen said.
“Wade – you are a champion! We moved the ball down the field today and have time to recoup and refresh during the holiday!” Metcalf texted the group.
Our reporting stunned the governor, he said, so after more than a year of requesting an interview with him, he agreed to a date in April 2025.
The governor responds
Why are we here? For the teachers to have money when they retire, DeWine said.
Morgan Trau: “What is the importance of a healthy pension fund?”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine: “It’s very important we have state systems, and this is the teachers’ retirement fund, and we certainly want that to be a sound fund. That’s always, always something that’s a concern, and retired teachers have been concerned about not getting cost of living allowances in the past. The stability of a retirement fund, I think, is very important. It’s not just the stability from an economic point, this is an area where stability and less drama is good.”
Trau: “Clearly, if we look at the past two years, drama encapsulates what has been happening at STRS. What is going on from your perspective?”
DeWine: “Well, I think things have calmed down. I’m looking at it from afar, but it seems that the board is working, and working in a productive way. I think we’ve, at least for a while now, we’ve come over from that problem that we’ve had in the past.”
The problems worsened in 2023. Initially appointed by former Gov. John Kasich, Steen has become somewhat of a martyr, many reformers told me. He was reappointed by DeWine when the governor started his administration, but the governor asked him to resign in 2023. Steen refused, so DeWine removed him. DeWine initially cited Steen’s alleged poor attendance at board meetings as reasoning.
However, a court ruled that DeWine did not have the legal authority to remove Steen based on Ohio law, and thus, Steen was put back on the board in the spring 2024.
I asked the governor during our interview why he had removed Steen, to which he reiterated that his attendance was satisfactory. Steen disagreed.
Trau: “When I talked with your team in May of 2024, they told me that there was also a concern about his close relationship with the investment firm QED and that led you to have doubt in his fiduciary duty.”
DeWine: “Well, there certainly was some information going around in regard to that, of course. Then when we got the document, it was an anonymous document, but it seemed to be well informed and I felt I wanted to, frankly, get that document over to elected officials who might have an interest in investigating or might have an obligation to investigate it.”
Trau: “When it comes to the pension fund and the allegations that are against former board members, the current board chair – what kind of outcome could happen if these allegations are all true?
DeWine: “Well, I don’t really know. I’ve not followed the attorney general’s suit that closely, but when you look at what you have been able to uncover, the things that have been filed in court… I would just call it a concerning set of facts. It’s very concerning that you have that close a relationship, going back and forth between a member of the board and the company that wants a job, basically. They want to be hired and clearly, you see [Seth] Metcalf, for example, going back and forth. It just seems to me that that’s very, very disconcerting. It’s very upsetting, and it raises a lot of questions. Now, we’ll see where the lawsuit goes and we’ll see what the final verdict is. I’m not going to prejudge that at all, but based upon what you are reporting — yeah, it doesn’t look very good.”
Pulling out some of the text messages I obtained, I passed the documents to the governor to look through.
Hundreds of texts show Metcalf gave Steen questions to ask during board meetings, documents to propose, and pushed him to follow QED’s plan.
“I think we can win this but I need to nuisance it,” Steen texted in 2020, as he was pitching QED’s proposal.
“I think you’ve got the votes! Make the motion! Announce that you have a solution,” Metcalf responded.
Metcalf continually texted talking points, themes and direct quotes for Steen to follow while he was in the board meetings.
Steen followed his lead.
Trau: “What do you think about the fact that they were giving directions during board meetings and they were giving quotes to say and those quotes were then said out loud?”
DeWine: “It would be highly, highly, highly unusual for that to happen. A member of the board has a fiduciary obligation to all the people he or she represents. They have an obligation to the retired teachers. They have an obligation to people who are currently putting their money into that — current teachers. So, for that person to have that close of relationship with a person who is basically coming to the board and saying ‘Hire us, we know what we’re doing,’ – yeah, it’s not a normal situation, let’s put it that way. Again, I can’t judge it. All I can tell you is what you have seen and what you’ve pulled from the court documents.”
Evaluating the text message threads with numerous legal and pension industry experts, each indicated suspicion, with Case Western Reserve University law professor, joined by others, adding that this could be used to argue there was a level of coordination.
Trau: “You are an attorney, and when you look at this, does this look like coordination to you?”
DeWine: “Well, I’m not gonna draw any legal conclusions, but just knowing what each role these players are supposed to be playing – they’re not playing their normal roles. That’s not what we would normally expect… The member of the board is supposed to be impartial and supposed to be making a judgment call based upon what is in the best interest of STRS, in this case, and ultimately in the retired teachers.”
I referenced how familiar Metcalf and Steen spoke to each other.
Trau: “Should we be paying attention to the language that this investment firm is using when talking to a board member?”
DeWine: “Well, it’s unusual language — let’s just put it that way.”
Trau: “Obviously, there are people who back Wade Steen extensively. There has been a legal fund with thousands of dollars given to him to fight the removal and to fight this current lawsuit against Attorney General Dave Yost. Some of these people, even with these text messages, say that this is political interference. How do you gain back the trust of these pensioners that believe that you and AG Dave Yost are wrong?
DeWine: “Well, the only concern I’ve always had is for the board to function well and to make good judgments, do the best that they could for the retired teachers. I see retired teachers all the time. They’ve worked very, very hard. Teachers are the people that educate our kids. Everybody can remember a teacher, more than one teacher, who literally changed their life. These are important people and we need to do the best we can for them.
I don’t want to be a member of the board. I’m not looking over everybody’s shoulder. We just have to have a functioning board, that makes decisions based upon what is in the best interest of these teachers. When they pick the investment advisors, you would think that they would be picking people who are experienced and people who have a good track record. You’re not always going to be successful with every investment, but what you have to look at is the totality of the investments.”
Trau: “Do you feel vindicated by the texts coming out?”
DeWine: “Well, I don’t know if vindicated. Look, we’re simply after what’s best for the retired teachers.”
I noted how DeWine removed Steen during a critical election when the reformers took control of the board and then released the 14-page memo during another pivotal election when the reformers took a supermajority of the board. With this dominance, they would be able to start shifting the investment structure, something that reformers claim DeWine wants to prevent.
Trau: “Some argue that that timing is suspicious. Could you see why they would say that?”
DeWine: “Well, it’s not true. We were trying to get the information out, for example, in regard to the memo we got. We, very quickly, got it over to six different officials, public officials, who we thought and believe they do have investigative authority, or have the ability to act, upon that memo. I really did not have the ability to act upon that memo… When you see very serious allegations like that, we have to get that document over to the people who have an obligation to take action.”
I referenced the reformers’ goal of switching the investment structure.
Trau: “Do you think that that would yield better results than right now? And should they have had the opportunity, if the majority on the board wants to do that, should they be able to do that?”
DeWine: “Well, if the majority wants to do that they certainly can do that. For the average citizen, I think investing in the stock market, following investment in funds that allow you basically to get the return or lack of return that the whole stock market is getting, that makes some sense… Pension funds take a more conservative point of view. They have to be paying out so much money every single month, they have to be paying out every single year, and they don’t want to have a great risk, so they will be much more diversified even than that… And what Metcalf was selling was something that would be very, very unusual for a pension fund.”
I noted Metcalf’s history, asking why the governor thinks someone may be entered in giving 70% of a pension fund to a startup without the technology to pull off the plan. DeWine emphasized how Metcalf was not qualified.
There are real, valid concerns from educators — DeWine acknowledged — but as we have reported, STRS is doing better than most of the other state pension funds.
“I do hear from teachers about how much the advisors were getting paid,” the governor said. “I think you have some people who are just looking at this and saying, ‘Look, these people are paid too much money,’ and look, those are legitimate discussions that people can have and they can believe they’re getting too much or you can argue they’re not getting too much. But those are, I think, some of the reasons that people were getting upset.”
The investment staff get paid by salary and performance-based incentives (PBIs). Losing these bonuses could slash up to half of their salary, former STRS chief actuary Brian Grinnell told me in July.
The average yearly “salary” for STRS investment staff members was roughly $230,300, that number including PBIs, as they have typically been approved for $10 million in bonuses per year. The board voted to eliminate the PBIs to make the reformers happy, resulting in their major compensation advisor quitting and their fiduciary counsel telling them they were violating the law. They reinstated them soon after.
But it’s been a tough few years financially, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. I noted this, the current look at the stock market, inflation, and the fiscal hits people faced from COVID. COLA could help retired teachers. The Retirement Study Council said they are on track to restore it in a decade fully.
Trau: “People are suffering with this and they are very upset. They are, many of them, blaming you for this oversight of the board. Is that fair?”
DeWine: “Well, I get one person on the board, so I only have one person on the board that I appoint. I guess you can blame the governor for anything, but my concern has been the same and my goal has been the same — and that is to have board members who are going to focus every single day on the best interest of the retired teachers.”
Referencing how DeWine had said the board had calmed down, I mentioned their attempt to hire a consultant firm without relevant experience with ties to the board members. Our investigation disqualified them due to their staff contacting the board members during a “blackout period,” when the interview process is underway and communicating isn’t allowed.
Trau: “Are we not looking at it seriously by saying that it’s calming down?”
DeWine: “Well, everything is relative. It certainly calmed down some. If I was a member of the board, I think I would remember my fiduciary obligation to the retired teachers and every decision I made doesn’t mean every decision will be right, but what I would have in my mind every single day, every time I went to the committee meeting, every time I attended the meeting, every time I thought about this, ‘What’s in the best interest of the teachers and what should these investments be and who should be advising us.’”
Trau: “Some lawmakers have suggested that due to the controversy that is happening right now with the board, some of the voting power should be taken away from the educators — making them members of the board but just not voting members or taking down how many people. The teachers say that that would be undemocratic. Where do you stand?”
DeWine: “Well, I’m not advocating any kind of change. The board members are not experts, their job is to hire experts… Their job is to pick the right people who have a track record of investment and continue to have that oversight that the board should have.”
Talking about hiring the right people, I brought up the text messages and how QED still wants a job. Metcalf has said that their plan will work to bring in money, and they can make it better. Regarding the messages, I followed up with the governor on his concerns.
Trau: “When did you think it was unusual, was there a specific text message or was it just overall?
DeWine: “Well, you’re talking about what you pulled from the filings. Frankly, you put it all together in a form that people could read it. So I didn’t read all those, I didn’t have those pulled. I read it when you had it put together and you had all those laid out… Once you read it, I think anybody reads it, would be concerned about it.”
Trau: “When I’ve talked with QED, they’ve said that there’s nothing illegal about potentially acting as consultants or advisors to Steen because they say they know more than him when it comes to the investment structure. Do you believe that you know he could just be talking to them for advice?
DeWine: “Well, I think people can come up with their own conclusions on that.”
Trau: “What’s yours?”
DeWine: “Well, l again, I don’t know what’s in someone’s heart. I don’t know what’s in their mind. I just know that is a very unusual relationship, a very close unusual relationship.”
The governor wouldn’t comment on whether Metcalf, who worked in state government for years, should have known better than to communicate with a board member in the way he did.
Trau: “Some critics argue that with your text messages with FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, [where] they ended up putting $500,000 in a dark money PAC for you, some argue that there’s no difference between that and QED contacting. Is that fair?”
DeWine: “No, I don’t think so. What we did is perfect, perfectly legal. You report contributions.”
A public records request reveals that DeWine communicated frequently during his first run for governor with Jones and VP Michael Dowling. The pair held lavish fundraisers before he was elected, with Jones giving speeches about how DeWine would be great for “his company and shareholders,” a speech I received said. Plus, Jones provided the now-governor money when he asked.
Referencing QED, I followed up. We had, earlier, talked about his thoughts on if there was a campaign waged behind the scenes to get certain people elected. He said he didn’t know.
Trau: “Are you saying that there might be some financial involvement?”
DeWine: “I’m not alleging anything about what they were doing… People have a right to wage a campaign as long as they stay within the law. They have a right to raise money and they have a right to push somebody to be on STRS’ board. To my knowledge that, per se, is nothing illegal about that. This is a free country. People have the right to speak out and they have the right to give money to a candidate and they have the right to advocate for that candidate.”
Trau: “But the same people argue that the closeness in your relationship with FirstEnergy executives could be comparable to QED and Wade Steen, Rudy Fichtenbaum.”
DeWine: “Well, it’s a different situation. I mean the situation in regard to the board is that these two members of the board have a fiduciary relationship and a fiduciary obligation. And you have someone who is pitching them, not in their individual capacity. They weren’t going to hire them to do their individual work. They were going to hire them as a member of the board and that is what is questionable I think.”
Through a short back-and-forth, I clarified with DeWine about why he thought the communication was different.
“I think it is really comparing apples and pears or something, I think it’s really different,” DeWine continued. “This is a board which has a fiduciary obligation… They have a legal obligation to give their best judgment, so you read that and draw your own conclusions from that.”
I brought up the future for Steen since he had told me during his last meeting for the board that he wasn’t sure if he was entirely done with STRS yet. His supporters have suggested him for the executive director role, CFO, or CIO.
“Whether it’s a wise move or not it’s a different question,” the governor answered. “I think it’d be a mistake to put Steen back on there. I’m not going to reappoint him.”
Trau: “Moving forward, it seems the board has realized they can’t do everything that they want to do with totally changing how the investment structure works. Do you think that this is going to have to be an ongoing process where eyes are on it at all times because people could still try to hire their friends?”
DeWine: “Well, I think the public’s eyes, thanks to you… are on them, and that’s always a good thing, They have to make these decisions out in public so I think that’s that’s a good thing.”
We also touched on Signal, an encrypted app that deletes conversations within a set period of time. QED used Signal frequently to speak to Steen and Fichetnbaum, even recently as last year. They used it to talk to me, too, until I reported the existence of Fichtenbaum’s deleted messages to them.
Trau: “Should public officials be allowed to be using apps where they delete and they’re encrypted?
DeWine: “Well, we’ve got pretty good strong laws today, as you know. No matter what your means of conveyance, that really doesn’t matter. That doesn’t give you any legal protection. What makes you, makes the news media or anybody in the public, able to get information is if you were acting in your official capacity.”
Trau: “Sure, we have them when they exist, but when it’s Signal and they delete automatically within reading of them — should there be a prohibition on the fact that they can delete without being under FOIA (Freedom of Information Act that allows the public to records request and get access to documents)?
DeWine: “Look, as technology changes and it advances or regresses depending on how you want to look at it, we constantly should be looking at, see what needs to be changed. But I don’t know in this case whether that should be changed or not.”
Trau: “What do you think could be the best outcome in this situation to prevent against corruption under STRS?”
DeWine: “Well, the best outcome could be if there continues to be light on the subject, as they say, and these decisions are made out in the public. I mean, people are paying attention. You’re paying attention… That’s a good thing.”
He noted the unpredictability of being tied to the stock market, especially now. It is good to have a diversified portfolio, he added.
Trau: “How do you get people to believe you when they think that you’re trying to interfere against reform?”
DeWine: “Well, I have no reason to interfere against reform. I have every reason to try to make sure the retired teachers get a good deal, and that they’re taken care of… What I don’t want is to see chaos on that board, and what I don’t want is bad investments and people be hired who do not have the experience to make those investments.”
Trau: “What would your goal be? What is your one thing that you would want to say in this interview to pensioners and people who are struggling with the fact that they don’t know what’s going on?”
DeWine: “Well, I think the opportunity to know what’s going on is better than it was. I think people are paying attention to this board, they’re looking at it and that’s a good thing. It’s a very, very good thing.”

Wes Moore to veto the bill, but the governor's office said he will sign it in the coming weeks. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A group of lawyers is urging Gov. Wes Moore (D) to veto legislation that reduces the financial awards to victims of institutional abuse — but also rushing other claims to court before a May 31 deadline in case he signs it.
The call for a veto came as those same attorneys announced nearly two dozen new lawsuits Monday against one Catholic high school in Baltimore County. Robert K. Jenner, managing partner at Baltimore-based Jenner Law, called on Moore to reject the bill that was rushed through the final days of the 2025 Maryland General Assembly session.
“It breaks the faith with the thousands of survivors who have come forward believing that the state of Maryland was on their side and ready to hold perpetrators accountable,” said Jenner, one of roughly a half-dozen attorneys who spoke during a news conference at his firm’s Baltimore office.
But a Moore spokesperson said Monday that while the governor “acknowledges the trauma survivors of child sexual assault have endured and the difficult and unprecedented circumstances surrounding this legislation,” a veto is off the table.
“The General Assembly has carefully crafted legislation that will continue to allow the survivors to seek justice while preserving the long-term fiscal stability of the state,” the spokesperson said in an emai. “The governor will sign this legislation.”
House Bill 1378 passed both the House and Senate by veto-proof majorities.
While the attorneys decried the passage of House Bill 1378 , they said they are not waiting for Moore to veto the bill. The attorneys — part of a coalition calling themselves the Calvert Hall Lawyers Working Group — announced roughly two dozen new lawsuits against Towson-based Calvert Hall College High School.

Emily C. Malarkey, a partner at Baltimore-based Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin, said the new lawsuits represent what could potentially be a rush to file before the new law — with its lower caps on damages — takes effect.
“We’re working 24/7, for the next six weeks to get all our clients’ cases filed,” Malarkey said in an interview. “If we wait until June 1, their cap is going to drop in half, and we’re not going to do that to them. We’re going to work our butts off to get it done.”
Jenner praised the 2023 law, sponsored by Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) as well as a Supreme Court of Maryland ruling this year that held the law was constitutional. Wilson also sponsored HB1378, out of concern that potential settlements under the 2023 law could bust the state budget. It’s legislation that Jenner and other attorneys opposed.
“Finally, we thought we had a path to justice but here we are. A landmark victory for survivors that we thought ended the question has now been gutted. But this isn’t about budget math. This is about moral clarity. This is about a promise that the state of Maryland made and is now poised to break,” Jenner said.
The 2025 bill as passed “slashes the amount survivors can recover by jury, verdict or by settlement, and it limits them to a single payment when they have been abused several times, multiple times by the same perpetrator,” he said.
Malarkey’s firm on Monday filed a lawsuit on behalf of 14 clients against Towson-based Calvert Hall College High School. The lawsuit also names as defendants the Brothers of the Christian Schools, District of Eastern North America, and the Christian Brothers of Frederick. Both entities were responsible for managing and operating Calvert Hall.
The 45-page filing includes allegations of abuse against four members of the clergy — Brother Geoffrey Xavier Langan and the Revs. Laurence Brett, Jerome Toohey and Francis LeFevre. All four were named in a 463-page report on child sexual abuse in the Archdiocese of Baltimore released in 2023 by the Office of the Attorney General.
Stephen E. Arnold, a lay science instructor at Calvert Hall is also named as an abuser in the lawsuit filed Monday.
The claims filed Monday would come in under the current law, which said victims of abuse in private institutions could file a lawsuit at any time, and capped damages at $1.5 million per “occurrence” — a term over which plaintiff’s attorneys and some lawmakers disagree. For state and local government entities, the cap was set at $890,000 per occurrence.
Assuming Moore makes good on his promise to sign HB1378 into law, claims filed after June 1 would be capped at $700,000 for private institutions and $400,000 for public institutions The changes came after legislative analysts warned of the potential “enormous liability” stemming from claims against state institutions.

Those analysts said in January that there could be as many as 3,500 claims. And while they did not provide a potential price tag, conservative estimates initially set the amount at about $3.1 billion — an amount roughly equal to the structural budget deficit.
The actual amount of potential liability is not fully known.
The Child Victim’s Act, passed in 2023, was the result of a decade of effort to allow victims — who were children at the time they were assaulted — to file lawsuits that were otherwise time-barred. At the time, most of the focus was on survivors of abuse who made allegations against the Catholic Church.
The bill was praised at the time by Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D).
But the potential for liabilities grew as attorneys for those with claims argued that “per occurrence” meant each individual instance of sexual assault. Others argued for a more conservative definition that would combine assaults based on other factors. The result would be a reduction of the total amount a jury could potentially award.
The Archdiocese of Baltimore quickly sought bankruptcy protection before the law could take effect in October 2023.
At the same time, cases against the state were also making their way to the courthouse. One group of attorneys earlier this year told Maryland Matters they were representing roughly 4,500 claimants. If each one had just one claim of abuse and received the maximum award, the potential liability to the state is an estimated $4 billion.
“I could have never comprehended 4,500 claimants, and it’s an open door with another 1,500 in the hopper,” Wilson said in an interview earlier this year. He wondered aloud about “how much are taxpayers going to be on the hook for this?”
Those attorneys said many clients have more than one allegation of abuse. They also said that they have been in settlement discussions with the attorney general’s office. Those attorneys declined to provide details on the amount they were seeking, but said it was less than even what legislative analysts hinted at in January.
The Maryland attorneys are not the first to move cases to the courthouse. Levy Konigsberg, a New York-based law firm, filed lawsuits on behalf of 221 men and women the day after Maryland lawmakers adjourned the 2025 legislative session. All of the cases focus on allegations of sexual abuse at 15 state juvenile detention facilities.
The lawsuits bring the number of claims to roughly 2,000, according to the firm. Levy Konigsberg represents about 1,000 people who allege they were sexually abused while in state custody.

Ford Carr, D-Wichita, enters a hearing room on April 9, 2025. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Rep. Ford Carr and supporters in the gallery for his disciplinary hearing must have felt as though Kehlani and Dreamville penned the lyrics of their haunting 2023 R&B hit “Shadows,” about them. The hearing unfolded with painful familiarity and hypocrisy. 
Tropes, hundreds of years old. Ancient double standards. Selective outrage. 
Those there supporting Carr had decades of the Black experience in the workplace under their belts and, like him, have had to walk around with their defensive dukes up. Jobs are minefields, where your ability to clothe and feed loved ones often is arbitrarily threatened. 
The song opens: 
I can tell 
That there’s something lurking in the dark 
I can tell 
That you’re tryna catch me off guard
Carr, a Wichita Democrat, isn’t the most sympathetic symbol. Video taken at a Topeka pub in January captured a stream of bile and aggression rarely heard or seen away from a street corner.  
I’ve come to know Carr fairly well since he started at the Statehouse, and we’ve worked together on various projects. He’s complex. He’s an engineer and a martial artist. He revealed during the hearing how his father was killed.
He was accused of a broad pattern of menacing behavior, but he’s not the one denying people health care. He’s not the one denying children summer school meals. He’s not the one hellbent on destroying public education. 
Claims that he created a negative environment feel galling coming from his accusers. 
Supporters love Carr’s pugilistic style but worry about his defaults to coarse language and physical confrontation. They also know he’s on the right side of issues and that he won’t show up to a knife fight with pom pons. 
Supporters also recognize the games his opponents are playing with his House seat, with his character and with his constituents. Like him, they’ve likely said: 
And I’m trying my best, my best to keep from going under
And it’s hard to forget 
All the rain when we keep hearing the thunder 
It just feels like shadows keep following me 



Carr’s supporters had a larger concern: how Black people with strong, culturally authentic voices, from Malcolm X in the 1960s to Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett today, get policed.  
There’s always a color tax. Whatever problem you have in this society, if you add Black, your situation worsens. Our mistakes cost us more. Our achievements mean less. 
Carr touched on this during the hearing. He said of the more than 6,000 people who have served as legislators, only 128 were Black, or 2.13%. That percentage represents more than 90 percent of legislators hauled into hearings like his. 
The hearing began with an explicit show of force from Capitol police positioned in the corners of the room. 
The police presence brought back a scene from the book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, where police intimidated a client’s supporters before a hearing with police dogs. Many remembered police unleashing dogs on peaceful civil rights protesters. 
Then, a condescending warning from Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Lewis. 
“This is not a political rally,” Lewis said.
Lewis controlled everything from meeting times (changed multiple times without concern for Wichita constituents), meeting rooms (changed multiple times) and what evidence he would allow. 
That exclusion also felt familiar. African Americans represent America’s “exceptionalism” because the rights much of the country sings about while wrapping themselves in the flag, apply to everyone — except us. 
It’s why “patriots” reflexively oppose civil rights. Whenever they exalt this nation, there sit Black people bearing the scars of America’s worst impulses. That’s why so many eagerly want to bury evidence of those misdeeds. It is not just that they don’t understand. They don’t want to understand so they can luxuriate in blissful ignorance of what others must confront daily. We occupy separate realities. 
Consider the presence of Republican Rep. Leah Howell, Carr’s accuser. 
Howell is a small white woman. She appeared in the same hearing room as the towering Carr, a Black man. Her complaint reminded me of historical dog whistles, some made famous by the racist film Birth of a Nation.
Rep. Henry Helgerson, the Democrat whom Carr pushed down during that bar fracas, didn’t file a complaint. Howell did so instead. The same bar video showed Howell patting Carr’s shoulder as tempers raged. 
It would seem difficult to claim fear after doing that, but Howell did so, saying tearfully that “her conscience” compelled her to speak out, adding that she would have done the same thing had a Republican acted in similar fashion. 
Only, she didn’t. 
In February, Republican Rep. Nick Hoheisel aggressively approached Carr, uttering profanity on the House floor. She filed no complaint. 
Howell also invoked racism, which felt appropriate given that many Black Wichitans know her district for its overt racism. 
During the past few decades, a cross was burned in a family’s yard; residents protested the disciplining of a white child who had drawn a Confederate Battle Flag; parents hounded an educator for showing a diversity film; Black athletes have complained of crowds racially jeering at them. A mother there said bullying led her daughter to attempt suicide. 
Suddenly Howell’s conscience is calling? Sounds more like selective outrage. 
Kansas Reflector reported in February for example, how Republican Rep. Patrick Penn joked — from the House floor — about shooting former Democratic Rep. Jason Probst in a conversation with freshman legislator Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson. 
I guess conscience comes and goes. 
Probst shared a story on his Substack blog about a racist joke told among a gaggle of Republican representatives. According to Probst, the members enjoyed the following: “What’s the most confusing holiday in Ferguson, Missouri?” 
Answer: “Father’s Day.” 
For the record, a 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found Black fathers were more involved in their children’s lives than white or Hispanic fathers. 
Probst added in the blog: “They (conservative leadership) actively legislate to silence any dissenting voice. They use the levers of the system they control to enforce compliance. They punish those who refuse to be controlled by the rules.” 
 This is why they wanted to break Carr’s will. 
I felt it in my spirit. I know they try to kill it …
That two-faced sh– finished. Don’t push me to my limit. 
 And that’s the game so many people have faced at work. 
And I’m trying my best, my best to keep from going under
And it’s hard to forget
All the rain when we keep hearing the thunder 
I can remember a nugget of weather wisdom I received from a security guard at my first job. As we locked up and stepped out into a cloudy March night, we could hear thunder grumbling in the distance. 
“That means spring is near,” he said, pointing into the sky. 
Maybe. 
Spring symbolizes renewal and rebirth. Even resurrection for some. A new reality. 
But for many of us, we only get rain. 
The thunder hovers like shadows, and our springtime never arrives.

(Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)What a con. The billionaire owners of the Browns pulled a doozy on Ohio lawmakers to get the state to pony up a ton of public money for a domed stadium and glitzy development that nobody but Jimmy and Dee Haslam want. 
A slick presentation and some up-front cash — if rosy revenue projections flatline — did the trick. All the Haslams had to do to win a $600 million handout in the budget bill, passed last week by Ohio House Republicans, was convince the supermajority to trust them about making good on taxpayer stadium subsidies.   
Funny how Donald Trump’s henchmen used the same “trust me” pitch to urge shellshocked Americans to just accept that the president knows what he’s doing when he tanks the economy, wipes out trillions in retirement funds, and launches an incoherent trade war with the world. But I digress. 
The Haslams have their own angle to exploit with pliable state legislators, if not the public. They laid the groundwork for over half a billion in state subsidies for their private enterprise with generous campaign checks to Statehouse Republicans and healthy donations to party priorities — like $100,000 to defeat the anti-gerrymandering initiative last fall.
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

So, when the Browns lobbied the political beneficiaries of Haslam largesse in Columbus, the die was cast for a publicly subsidized covered stadium complex that could easily be paid for with private dollars. 
If the Ohio Senate concurs on the Haslam money ask — a terrible use of finite government resources — the state is poised to pay out $600 million in state-issued bonds for a second Browns stadium in Cuyahoga County based on little more than a promise of tangible economic benefits in return.
That’s nuts. The news is replete with examples of government-subsidized boondoggles never generating the benefits taxpayers were promised. (Still waiting on the Intel miracle to materialize.)
 But the list of sports teams promising the moon in new tax revenue, jobs and businesses in sketchy cost-benefit projections and falling short — is long. Before Ohio commits to financing the Haslam’s stadium and real estate venture with 30 years of bond payments that will, with interest, cost about a billion in forgone public services, taxpayers deserve some due diligence on the Browns money-making claims.
That was not done to any degree warranted in the Ohio House before a swift party-line vote forced taxpayers to foot the bill for a massive stadium project purely to appease wealthy team owners who greased GOP chiefs for government windfalls.
 It’s all about money and power. Forget tangible return on taxpayer investment. There’s a mountain of empirical studies on why publicly funded stadiums are a bad idea. It’s political malpractice by elected representatives. But House Republicans are stubbornly blind to raw facts when it comes to rationalizing corporate welfare at taxpayer expense. 
Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart was practically giddy about giving hundreds of millions in state subsidies (on top of other public contributions for infrastructure improvements to tax abatements) to help the owners of the Browns build their latest plaything. 
  State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville.(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)
“We’re going to have multiple Super Bowls played in the stadium,” he gushed about the brand-new home of a record-losing team — the Browns went 3-14 last season. “This is going to be a destination center!” 
Because the Haslams say so, Stewart?
Never mind the economic devastation on downtown Cleveland when the Haslams leave the lakefront for suburban Brook Park, a move that will create its own costly infrastructure nightmare for heavy airport traffic. 
Never mind that Cuyahoga County and Cleveland leaders remain adamant that the Browns’ “scheme” to relocate out of the city is a “betrayal to Ohio taxpayers” who paid for the stadium and bought the promises of their home team. 
Never mind that there is ongoing litigation to keep the Browns in Cleveland and firm opposition by Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne to any local funding for the Browns’ Brook Park stadium proposal. He called the Haslams $3.4 billion plan in the southwest suburb a “risky bet with public dollars” the county should not take and advocated, instead, for renovating the existing Browns stadium on the lakefront. 
“Having the stadium down there seems to be in everybody’s best interest,” said Jimmy Haslam in 2023, “so we’re committed to redoing the stadium.” 
Now he’s hitting up state and local governments for big bucks to underwrite what’s in his best interest; an extravagant and expensive gamble on a tract of land in Brook Park near the congested intersection of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. But it’s taxpayers who will eat the loss of public funds if Haslam’s crapshoot is a bust. 
Yet rather than slow down deliberations on the Browns’ wager and take a closer look at a huge public expenditure beset with more questions than answers, Ohio House Republicans rushed to indulge a prominent campaign donor with deep pockets. 
They stuffed their sweetheart bond deal for the Haslams into a budget bill that slashed public school funding, clawed back money from fiscally responsible districts, cut library funds, Medicaid expansion, even programs that target Ohio’s still high infant mortality rate and fund pediatric cancer research. How not to make Ohio great again.
But $600 million in taxpayer subsidies to play fantasy football with billionaires in exchange for government debt with little to no positive economic impact? “A once-in-a-lifetime” project, cooed Stewart. What a con.

Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
 ‘A gut punch’

Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
 Continuing efforts

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

Nelson.","Protestors outside the U.S. District Court of Maryland in Greenbelt rally in support of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father who was deported to El Salvador in an ""administrative error,” calling for him to be returned to the U.S. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The 14th Amendment of the Constitution bestowed a new covenant of law and order to the several states, citizens and residents of the United States. While born or naturalized citizens are entitled to certain rights and privileges that noncitizens are not, namely franchise and eligibility for public office, Section 1 of the amendment makes abundantly clear that any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is entitled to equal protection of, and due process under, her laws.
Neither the federal government nor the states may hold any person subject to their jurisdiction to a lower standard of legal protection or override the legal process — this condition does not move with the tide of political ideology in Washington, and its application ought not to change with popular sentiment toward immigration.
These constitutional realities, nonetheless, clash with the prerogative of the Trump White House. Within 1o0 days, enabled through Congress via the Laken Riley Act, the due process and equal protection clauses have been overridden. The consequences have been gravely concerning, with one Maryland family being ripped apart in a gross display of administrative incompetence.
Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was recently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and subsequently deported to the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador. He is a resident of Prince George’s County and has a wife and three young children who are all U.S. citizens. He fled El Salvador due to gang activity targeting his business, and a U.S. judge granted Temporary Protected Status on the basis that he would likely be targeted and harmed by gang violence were he to return to his home country.

The administration has conceded that he was incorrectly detained based on an “administrative error,” with Robert Cerna, the acting field office director for enforcement and removal operations for ICE saying so in a sworn statement. Despite this, the administration argues that Abrego Garcia cannot be retrieved because he is now under Salvadorean jurisdiction.
The U.S. District Court for Maryland ordered Abrego Garcia returned no later than 11:59 p.m. on April 7, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that order. The Supreme Court paused the district court order briefly, but on April 10 it sent the case back to the lower court, directing the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return and “ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”
Instead, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security doubled down on their assertion that Abrego Garcia is affiliated with the gang MS-13. Tricia McLaughin, DHS spokesperson, stated without evidence in a Fox News interview that he is involved in human trafficking, and in a later interview with National Public Radio cited an unnamed immigration judge who allegedly determined his affiliation with MS-13. When pressed to provide evidence for her claims, McLaughin said the information was “law enforcement sensitive” and its release would undermine national security.
In a clear-cut example of Orwellian doublespeak, McLaughlin told NPR on April 7 that due process is being applied to each case of deportation, but that it looks different for “terrorists”:  “In every single case, there is due process. When you’re looking at members of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua and other terrorist organizations that were designated as terrorist organizations under President Trump and the Trump administration, due process does look different because you’re under terrorist authority. So it’s going to be more law enforcement sensitive, but I can guarantee, and our DOJ guarantees, due process to these individuals.”
She asserts that due process is adhered to, then proceeds to rationalize a lack of due process on the basis of a national security threat that has not been demonstrated or proven. If this statement was not in direct contradiction to DHS’s own admission of error, perhaps it would be more convincing.
The complete lack of evidence presented, along with her antagonistic response to the fact that Abrego Garcia is a Maryland father, demonstrates the truth of the matter: the Trump administration is mandating Homeland Security to override the constitutional rule of law, and is prepared to defend the illegal detention and deportation of an innocent man to a foreign prison rife with human rights abuses.
During Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s visit to the White House on Monday, both hez and Trump resolved that they do not intend to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States, defying the 9-0 Supreme Court verdict and teeing up a constitutional crisis.
If this can happen to one Maryland family, the fabric of communities across the state is now jeopardized. This disruption to law and order ought to spark a sense of urgency in Maryland lawmakers to defend their oath to the laws of the United States, advocate for Marylanders and protect their communities even, and especially, when the federal government cannot be relied upon to do so.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/marylandprotesters-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-15 05:00:35.913684

Travis Holdman, R-Markle, presents his tax bill before the Senate on Jan. 28, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Shortly after midnight Tuesday, Indiana Senate Republicans agreed to significant changes in an immense local property and income tax plan — avoiding risky negotiations in favor of sending it to Gov. Mike Braun.
Despite earlier reservations — and a pressure campaign to veto — the governor appeared resolute immediately following the Senate vote.
“This is historic property tax relief. Senate Bill 1 cuts property taxes for most Hoosier homeowners, farmers, and businesses, limits future tax hikes, and makes the tax system fairer, more transparent, and easier to understand,” Braun said in a statement. “Real property tax relief was a core promise of my Freedom and Opportunity Agenda and with the collaborative leadership of our legislators, we are delivering real savings and protections for taxpayers. I look forward to signing the bill as soon as I receive it.”
The 27-22 tally came well ahead of an end-of-month deadline and followed a marathon day in the Senate chamber. Twelve Republicans joined Democrats in opposition: Sens. Ron Alting, Eric Bassler, Vaneta Becker, Mike Bohacek, Jim Buck, Cyndi Carrasco, Spencer Deery, Dan Dernulc, Aaron Freeman, Jim Tomes, Mike Young and Andy Zay
None of those senators spoke on the bill.
Senate Bill 1 would save homeowners a collective $1.2 billion in property taxes over three calendar years, from 2026 through 2028, according to a Thursday fiscal analysis. It does so largely by creating a credit for 10% off every homestead’s bill, up to $300 each.
  Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith addresses the property tax rally on March 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
That’s after House lawmakers on Wednesday made sweeping edits featuring the governor’s blessing and Senate input. It’s a far cry from Braun’s original plan.
Democrats discussed lost revenue for schools and communities that will force either local income tax hikes or severe service cuts.
Local units of government would lose a projected $1.5 billion over the three years, per the fiscal analysis. Public school corporations alone represent about half the anticipated loss, at $744 million — although Democrats contend other tax changes push that figure to almost $800 million.
“We’ve heard relief, relief, relief,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, Indianapolis. “But the efforts that we have in Senate Bill 1 are complex, and I don’t feel like they go far enough, and I do think that they create winners and losers.”
But Republicans noted revenue still goes up for most units — just not as much as under current law.
For instance, the city of Fort Wayne would see its property tax revenue rise from $167 million in 2025 to $201 million in 2028 if no changes are made. Under Senate Bill 1, the city will see revenue rise from $167 million to $187 million in 2028.
” I want to make sure we know it’s not loss, it’s unrealized potential gain,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville.
Still, Democrats weren’t the only ones unhappy with the deal.
“NOBODY understands this thing … including me!” Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, Braun’s second-in-command, posted Saturday. “On that basis alone we can’t let this become law. The Gov needs to VETO this thing, call a special session and demand the legislature pass something that the average Hoosier can understand without hiring army of lawyers and accountants!!”
Debate focuses on local income taxes 
Senators started debate on the bill at 10:35 p.m. A vote followed nearly two hours later at 12:18 a.m. Tuesday.
During the discourse, bill author Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, emphasized that Indiana’s property taxes “are very complicated” — and that “it’s taken the legislature 50 years to make it as complicated as we possibly could” — but under this bill, two-thirds of homeowners will receive a lower bill in 2026 compared to 2025.
The legislation caps total local income tax rates for all counties to 2.9%, down from 3.75%. Municipalities would be authorized to impose rates up to 1.2% within that county total — a tool they have not had before. Under current law, they have to get county officials on board to nab a local income tax.
Indianapolis Democrat Sen. Greg Taylor said Hoosier taxpayers were promised relief on property tax bills, “but I guess we didn’t add the comma and say, ‘But you really end up paying more on your income tax.'” He worried that locals will be forced to cut essential services if they resist income tax hikes.
Indiana House Republicans OK massive local property, income tax plan that Democrats dub a ‘scam’

“When your city council comes to you and says, ‘What do you want us to do? Cut services or increase (local income taxes)?’… we’re going to say, ‘Well, we gave you an option,'” Taylor said.
“We know what the option is going to be. We’re going to cut services. You mark my words. You’re going to cut services,” he continued. “You think we’ve got road problems? You think we’ve got access to government service problems? Just wait.”
Holdman held that while higher local income taxes “may be the case in some situations,” raising those taxes remains optional.
Instead, he preferred for local governments to become “more efficient” before raising taxes.
“I think there are expenses that cities and towns and county governments have that they could trim their budgets,” Holdman added. “I think there needs to be a review of all expenditures at a local level to make sure that they’re spending their dollars wisely.”
Also under the bill, fixed-income seniors would get an additional $150 discount off their property tax bills stacked atop the $300 maximum available to the general population. Disabled veterans could also qualify for stackable credits of $150 and $250.
In exchange, lawmakers nixed assessed-value-based deductions for those populations.
Renters ‘left out’
Over three years, the bill would cut property taxes by about $25 million for apartments, almost $69 million for other residential properties, $116 million on farmland and $145 million on personal property. But bills for agricultural business and other real properties would rise by $63 million and $720 million, respectively.
That adds up to about $802 million in savings across other property types.
The overhauled legislation additionally phases in a major increase in the acquisition cost threshold for the business personal property tax exemption — from $80,000 to $2 million — and narrows application of the 30% depreciation floor. It previously would’ve phased the tax itself out by 2030 on anything purchased this year or later.
Still, Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, questioned why the bill does not directly address — or provide relief for — the 560,000 tenants across the state.
Holdman held that his measure deals with property taxes, which “tenants do not pay.”

Qaddoura disagreed.
“Tenants do pay property tax,” he said. “When you live in an apartment building or in a house, the landlord will pass all of these costs, including property taxes.”
Hunley further took issue with the inclusion of Senate Bill 518, a measure to require traditional schools to share property taxes with charters. Another provision dissolve the Union School Corporation.
“I think that we do need to talk about process and procedure, and the fact that this is the way that we’re going to do business from now on — that we can just simply amend into a piece of legislation the closure of an entire school district,” she said. “And that we can do that without regard for public hearing or process, and that we can just redraw new maps and new boundary lines for an entire school corporation, for families, for a whole community from up here on high in Marion County, and determine what’s best without true regard for collaboration with the community.”
Before the vote, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, reiterated that the legislation “is too big,” and that lawmakers “have forced too much into one bill.”
“As you shuffle the burden of taxes, there may be some that gets pushed to businesses. … but ultimately, we’re doing so at the expense of already struggling schools, struggling communities, renters and others that need us most,” he said. “There are multiple poison pills throughout this thing. And ultimately, school districts and local communities will have to make the toughest decisions that they’ve ever had to, at a time where things are just uncertain.”

This decision may seem like a minor regulatory choice, but its consequences will ripple across the state, affecting consumers, medical patients, businesses, and even Connecticut’s tax revenue.
Here’s what’s at stake:
• Limited consumer choice – The cap ensures that adult-use cannabis remains restricted to lower-potency products, leaving many consumers without the options they seek.
• A shrinking market – High-potency products are in demand, but many producers won’t bother navigating Connecticut’s strict regulations, opting out instead.
• Medical patients abandoned – Those who rely on higher-potency cannabis for pain management, PTSD, or other medical conditions will continue to struggle, despite statutory protections.
• A blow to local businesses – Consumers who can’t find what they need in licensed dispensaries will turn to unregulated markets, hurting Connecticut’s legal cannabis industry.
• Lost tax revenue – When people buy outside the system, the state and municipalities miss out on millions in tax dollars that could support infrastructure, public health, and community reinvestment.
The reality is simple: High-potency cannabis will exist whether lawmakers acknowledge it or not. The real question is whether these products will be sold safely in a regulated market or drive consumers into unregulated, potentially dangerous alternatives. Connecticut has an opportunity to strengthen its legal cannabis industry while protecting public health. By refusing to reconsider the THC cap, lawmakers are choosing prohibition-era thinking over practical policy—and everyone stands to lose because of it.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Disgusted with the CT Secretary of the State,Lisa Amatruda,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/registrar-disgusted-with-ct-sec-of-state/,A Woodbury Republican Registrar of Voters says she was appalled at Stephanie Thomas's partisan and insulting rhetoric.,"This past week, the Registrar of Voters Association of Connecticut (ROVAC) held its semi-annual conference. While Registrars of Voters (ROVs) are nominated and elected based on political party affiliation —each town and city in Connecticut must have one Republican and one Democrat Registrar— the core mission of our job transcends politics. 
When we walk into our offices to oversee the integrity of elections and maintain accurate voter rolls, we leave our political affiliations at the door. This nonpartisan approach is essential to ensuring that every voter, regardless of their background or beliefs, is treated professionally, fairly, and equally. Every citizen needs to feel confident that no matter who assists them in a registrar’s office, they will be treated with respect and impartiality.
ROVAC hosts two major training events each year: a three-day Spring conference and a two-day Fall session. These events provide critical education on election laws, policies, and best practices for maintaining accurate voter registration records. Each event also includes guest speakers, who share insights and expertise on various election-related topics. On Wednesday, April 10, Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas was invited as the guest speaker.
However, what followed was a stark departure from the spirit of professionalism that is expected at ROVAC events. Secretary Thomas began her speech by claiming that she is not a political or partisan person. Yet, her speech quickly devolved into one of the most divisive, political, and vitriolic tirades I have ever witnessed. 
Half the room consisted of Republican Registrars of Voters, and the tone and content of her address felt completely out of place. Secretary Thomas repeatedly criticized President Trump and his administration, spewing misinformation about his Executive Order on “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” She espoused partisan talking points, claiming that under this administration, women and people of color would be disenfranchised. I found it deeply insulting and classless that she suggested women and people of color somehow don’t know how to obtain a driver’s license or an official ID.
The situation escalated when Secretary Thomas referred to President Trump —and by extension, half the room— using the term “SS,” implying that we were akin to Nazis. This was the moment I got up and left the room. The venomous language and partisan rhetoric made it impossible to continue listening.
What is Secretary Thomas so afraid of? In Connecticut, we’ve seen instances like the Bridgeport ballot stuffing scandal, caught on camera, which demonstrate that our elections are far from flawless. 
Registrars of Voters in Connecticut are prohibited from asking for proof of citizenship when registering voters. Why, then, does Secretary Thomas oppose efforts to ensure that our elections are free from fraud and error, and unmarred by suspicion? These are fundamental concerns that transcend partisan politics and go to the heart of maintaining the integrity of our electoral system.
As the Executive Order on election integrity states, “The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election.” This is not a partisan issue. It is a fundamental concern for all Americans that only U.S. citizens vote in our elections.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut families need earned wage access,Kerri M. Raissian,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/connecticut-families-need-earned-wage-access/,The General Assembly should pass SB 1396 allowing Earned Wage Access to meet Connecticut workers’ real-world needs.,"In January 2024, Connecticut made legislative changes that effectively shut down the ability of many workers to obtain instant transfers of their own earned wages between pay periods. However, my new study with colleagues finds that the Connecticut General Assembly should reverse this and pass SB 1396 this session. Doing so would give Connecticut workers faster access to their earned wages and help them make ends meet.
Prior to 2024, Connecticut residents were able to instantly access their earned wages through an electronic transfer via Earned Wage Access (EWA).  EWA is a service that allows workers to access the income they have already earned but not yet received. To be clear, this is not a loan or a salary advance but providing someone the portion of a paycheck they have already earned, prior to payday. 


In order to get instant access, workers had to pay a $3.49 instant transfer fee (much like Venmo).  On January 1, 2024, Connecticut eliminated the instant transfer fee option, which, by removing the mechanism that allowed EWA service providers to cover their costs, effectively eliminated EWA in Connecticut.
As a researcher and Associate Professor of Public Policy at the University of Connecticut, much of my work —centered around using economic data to understand society’s problems— is ultimately about understanding how policy changes impact families. Colleagues and I wanted to know how this seemingly small, innocuous even, policy might affect people’s lives (the study was commissioned by DailyPay, an EWA provider, but conducted independently of them). To determine the effect of the instant transfer elimination, we surveyed 508 Connecticut-based EWA users and asked them a series of questions about their lives and finances, and if, and to what extent, they noticed any impact of the January 2024 EWA changes.

Kerri Raissian PhD
Of our 508 respondents, 65% were female, the majority were non-white, and 77% reported living with children in their homes. Although most of our sample indicated that they had been employed during the last seven days before our survey, 61% also reported an annual household income of less than $75,000. Most of our survey respondents reported not having access to savings, a budgeting plan, or the ability to cover unexpected expenses. In other words, these EWA users are Connecticut workers who live paycheck to paycheck.
Importantly, when EWA users access their earned wages, it was for urgent, time sensitive needs: the main reasons were food and groceries (91%), transportation including gas (66%), rent or mortgage (55%), and utility bills (60%) (see Figure 1 below, modified from the report). 


It seems appropriate that a user would need their wages immediately rather than in a few days’ time.  Given this, the instant transfer is an integral part to allowing EWA to provide financial relief to their family. 
In addition to asking users how they relied on EWA, we asked them about their financial circumstances in the past 12 months. Many of them had fallen behind on bills (65%), overdrew their bank accounts (28%), paid bills late (25%), paid credit cards late (25%), among other negative financial outcomes (see Figure 2 below, replicated from the report).


I see several financial hardships pressing on Connecticut’s families: higher cost of living, higher cost of credit, economic uncertainty, to name a few.  Those in our survey reported accessing their wages to purchase food and groceries, cover transportation costs, and pay for rent, mortgages, or utilities. Soon, the school year will end, making it harder for families to access social services and school meals to keep their children properly cared for and nourished. Without the services provided throughout the school year, reinstating the EWA instant transfer option could be especially welcome to Connecticut’s families this summer.
To be sure, the legislature’s 2024 decision to cut EWA in Connecticut was almost certainly designed to protect workers from predatory practices and tools that could take advantage of their financial limitations and needs. Even if it was well-meaning, however, it has had unintended consequences for employees and their families. Since the EWA change, too many Connecticut users say they have fallen behind on bills, overdrafted accounts, paid bills late, taken out a money order, or taken out a payday loan. Others have even had to go without meeting basic needs.
There are no perfect options for Connecticut’s residents whose salaries are too low and who face a cost of living that is too high. But by removing EWA, the state has seemingly moved them closer to things we’d all like to avoid: going into debt, relying upon the kindness of friends and family, or going without something they need for themselves and their children. Moreover, the $3.49 transfer fee is roughly equivalent to an ATM fee; it is likely less expensive and more transparent than cumulative credit card debt, overdraft fees, or loan interest; and it provides dignity to Connecticut’s families.
Finally, the users in our study said they thought the EWA tool was useful and fair. Our study shows that eliminating it is no solution for working families.
That is why the Connecticut legislature’s Banking Committee is seeking to revive EWA this year. I commend them for unanimously voting it out of the Banking Committee. I urge the Connecticut General Assembly to pass SB 1396 and allow Earned Wage Access to meet Connecticut workers’ real-world needs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Musk’s reverse-Robin Hood playbook is not new. Electric Boat has used it for years,Colleen Shaddox,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/15/musks-reverse-robin-hood-playbook-is-not-new-electric-boat-has-used-it-for-years/,Do Connecticut taxpayers get our money’s worth for the millions we hand to Electric Boat? I found no evidence that we do – and I looked hard.,"U.S. Americans worry that public funds for essential services are being diverted to the obscenely rich. They fear that it’s happening in the dark, where we cannot witness, let alone fight, this thievery.
I’m scared too but not surprised, because I spent about a year of my life tracking the millions that General Dynamics Electric Boat gets from Connecticut taxpayers and how state law explicitly prohibits us from getting information about what public benefits (if any) result.  I faced down a table full of lawyers defending the privacy of this highly profitable corporation  (General Dynamics netted 3.8 billion last year) as I was denied answers about where my (and your) money went.
Elon Musk has nothing on Electric Boat.
Let me begin at the beginning: In 2018 Connecticut pledged $83 million in aid to Electric Boat, ostensibly so that EB would expand Groton operations, create jobs and purchase more from in-state vendors. As this five-year program was wrapping up,  the War Resisters League asked me to investigate whether EB created the economic benefits the state was promised.
The first step was obvious: EB had to report annually to the state Department of Economic and Community Development on payroll, in-state purchases and other information that would indicate whether it was acting as a stimulus to the  economy. I requested copies of those reports under the Freedom of Information Act. I received documents that were largely redacted (Picture a blacked-out letter from a Soviet gulag). I appealed to the state’s Freedom of Information Commission, where my request was opposed not only by the state but by Electric Boat. The commissioners seemed sympathetic – after all I was asking about the return on the investment of my tax dollars – but agreed with EB’s counsel that state law explicitly includes FOIA exemptions for businesses getting assistance from DECD.
To state the obvious: corporate welfare should not get its own special exemption from FOIA disclosure.
I did get some satisfaction from FOIA requests. I learned how many EB employees qualify for SNAP and Medicaid. Not a lot (316), but the common wisdom is that EB jobs are good jobs, period. People with good jobs don’t need food stamps. Now that Musk and company are dismantling the federal safety net, I doubt these workers will get raises to keep the cupboards full. I learned that EB contests property tax assessments, so its valuations to the towns where it resides, Groton, New London, and Norwich, are reduced by millions. That’s money made up by the average homeowner, or by landlords who pass expenses on to their tenants.
I started asking myself, “If EB is such a treasure, why isn’t New London more like Greenwich?” Don’t get me wrong: I’d rather hang out in New London, with its far superior music scene. But the poverty rate is 20 percent in New London, with racial disparities that make it much higher in some communities. Furthermore, EB’s presence may be raising housing costs. One bedroom apartment rents rose 37% in New London from pre-pandemic 2020 to 2023 – the biggest jump in the state.
Imagine the state spent the $83 million it handed to EB on the region’s schools, microloans for small businesses, green conversions, and so on? Seems like a better strategy to fight poverty.
Is EB really the best investment Connecticut can make? I’ve been unable to get the data necessary to answer that question. I suspect that had the answer been “yes,”  the governor and EB’s CEO would have held a joint press conference to trumpet the numbers that I was denied.
About now, some readers are probably saying, “She was working for the War Resisters League. She’s some peacenik.” Guilty as charged.
But I set out to answer a financial question, not a moral one: “Do Connecticut taxpayers get our money’s worth for the millions we hand to Electric Boat?” I found no evidence that we do – and I looked hard.
People have different visions of what they want from government. That’s why we have elections. But no one that I know thinks government exists to take money away from the poor and middle class and jam it into the pockets of the rich. I don’t know why we tolerate it on the state or the federal level.
Joanne Sheehan of the War Resisters League and I will lead a discussion about the EB report at All Souls Unitarian Universal Community Room, 19 Jay St., New London, at 5:30 p.m., Thursday, April 17.
Please consider joining us. We still have some semblance of democracy. We should use it.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to Nampa with a message about fighting back against policies that benefit the wealthiest at the expense of working class Americans, but the comments about health care from every speaker seemed to resonate the most with those in attendance.
Sanders, an Independent U.S. senator from Vermont and former presidential candidate, has been touring various cities nationwide under the title “Fighting Oligarchy,” often with Ocasio-Cortez as a guest speaker. The night before, the pair spoke to a crowd of 20,000 to the south in Salt Lake City and the crowd in Nampa on Monday night reached the Ford Idaho Center’s full capacity of 12,500, according to Andrew Luther, the general manager of the arena.
Sanders said they chose to come to Idaho even though it is deeply conservative — President Donald Trump won the state by 36 points in November — because “we don’t accept this blue state, red state nonsense. We are one people.”
He railed against Elon Musk, the leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, who is the wealthiest man in the world and gave Trump’s presidential campaign $270 million. Ocasio-Cortez also spoke against members of Congress trading stocks, accusing several of insider trading, and both spoke about the need for universal health care.
“We’re here to flip this state,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We might all come from different places, but we share so many of the same experiences.”

 Idaho doctor talks physician shortage, state’s near-total abortion ban

Before the politicians took the stage, local family physician Dr. Penny Beach spoke about health care in Idaho, where the number of physicians per capita is the lowest in the country and a near-total abortion ban has further exacerbated that shortage, leading some OB-GYNs and half of the state’s maternal-fetal medicine specialists to leave the state and practice elsewhere. 
Idaho’s abortion law also came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024, when state officials argued that emergency room physicians should not be permitted to perform an abortion in emergency situations as mandated by federal law.
“We have created laws that criminalize health care providers and have led to almost 25% fewer OB-GYNs practicing in this state,” Beach said in her remarks. “We’ve seen labor and delivery units shut down. We’ve seen several attempts to repeal Medicaid expansion despite overwhelming public support. … It’s wrong, and we’re here to say, ‘Enough.’”
Beach told States Newsroom the shortage of OB-GYNs has led at least one large reproductive health clinic in the Boise area to stop accepting Medicaid patients altogether because the staffing difficulties have created financial strain. Nationwide, about 40% of births are covered by Medicaid. Beach said that’s why she supports Sanders’ message about providing health care for all Americans.
“We need to treat health care as a human right, not a luxury,” she said.
 Idahoans share different reasons for attending Nampa rally

Marissa Locati, one of the attendees, said she went to the rally because she wants a better future for her 11-month-old son, particularly with his future education in mind. 
The new mom and lifelong Idahoan said she’s also worried about reproductive rights. 
“I want to make sure that I am protected,” she said. “I want to be able to have the family I want and the size that I want. If any health concern pops up, I want to make sure that I can take care of it. That my health care is just as important as my husband’s or my son’s.”
Another attendee, Dylan Neubauer, said he doesn’t quite fit with either political party. The College of Western Idaho student moved to Nampa from a more Democratic state because he was attracted to the state’s socially conservative policies, such as promoting gun rights and anti-LGBTQ+ policies. 
But Neubauer said he also believes in union rights, fighting against corporations, and said he thinks Trump has gone too far with his immigration policy and women should be the ones making abortion policy decisions.
“We’re losing our rights every moment of the day, and nobody’s doing anything about it,” said Karing Nial, a Boise resident who attended the event. “I am so disappointed in our elected officials. I’m so disappointed in Congress. I want them to stand up and do the right thing, and no one is doing it, so the people have to.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The federal government has revoked the visas of four international students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, without explanation or prior notice to students or the university, university officials said on Monday. 
“This week, we learned that the federal government has revoked visas for four individuals affiliated with UAA — one current student and three recent graduates in post-graduation training — without prior notice,” said UA President Pat Pitney in a university wide email on Monday.  
No students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks or University of Alaska Southeast have been affected to date, Pitney said. She said university staff are monitoring immigration records daily, and working to support students. She urged affected students to contact international student services offices of their campus for support.
“These immigration issues do not impact a student’s academic standing at UA,” Pitney added. “Our international students and scholars are vital members of our community, and we remain fully committed to supporting their success.” 
The federal government did not provide the student or university a specific reason for the visa cancelations, according to Jonathon Taylor, university director of public affairs. 
When asked if any of the students were detained by the Alaska Department of Corrections, a spokesperson said they were not able to immediately respond by Monday afternoon. 
Students can generally stay in the U.S. but can no longer leave and re-enter without applying for another visa. 
If there are changes to a student’s immigration status, then the government is required to provide a reason, said Nicholas Olano, an Anchorage-based immigration attorney with Nations Law Group. 
“The question is, are the regulations being followed here? And that is what needs to be looked at carefully. Are these people giving proper notice?” he said.
Olano said usually an individual must be convicted of a crime for immigration status to be affected, but under the Trump administration it can be for simply an arrest, or allegations of misconduct. “What is happening now is by all means extreme,” he said. 
Over 1,000 international students have had visas revoked at over 180 colleges and universities, according to a national tracking project by Inside Higher Ed, a news site. Several students have filed lawsuits arguing the government has failed to justify canceling visas or terminating immigration status, and denied them due process.
Many cases are related to protests or statements in connection with the Israel-Hamas war.
An executive order Trump issued early in his term cited “an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism and violence,” and called on the government to use “all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.” Last week, the Trump administration announced it would screen immigrants’ social media for what it termed “antisemitism.”
However, students and advocates nationally have said many students are targeted for their involvement in peaceful protests to support Palestinians affected by the ongoing war, and the Trump administration’s actions target First Amendment protected rights to freedom of speech. 
Olano said it’s a “huge difference” between participating in a protest and a criminal infraction leading to a notice to appear before an immigration judge and be placed in deportation proceedings, but he advised students to take extra caution.
“It’s horrible; I’m having to say this because I think that the First Amendment, the Constitution, covers every single individual that is in the United States presently,” he said. “But at this moment, you should not exercise your right to free speech because you can have consequences. That’s the most un-American thing ever. But I’m saying it.”
Olano advised students to contact an immigration attorney, adding that legal resources and information are available by contacting the ACLU of Alaska. 
In addition to the effect on international students, Olano expressed concern for the state’s economy and future.
“This is going to hurt Alaska in the long run,” he said. “In the short term, too. We’re going to see less students that bring money from their countries to spend here at the universities. Because international students pay significantly higher tuition fees than the local students, and those monies are going to stop coming in. We are going to lose prospective employees for companies. And with all that is going on, Alaska is going to be hurting even more for people.”

If the governor vetoes the bill, lawmakers must meet “immediately” in joint session to vote and either confirm the governor’s veto or override it.
Overriding a veto on HB 69 would require 40 of the Legislature’s 60 members. Lawmakers for and against HB 69 have said they doubt there are enough votes to override a Dunleavy veto on the issue. 
And even if the bill became law, actually funding the formula would require action in a separate budget appropriation bill. Overriding a budget veto would require 45 of 60 legislators.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard) Washington House lawmakers, for nearly five hours on Monday, battled through the latest round of debate in the state Legislature over parental rights. 
Democrats say the bill they approved is needed to clarify parts of a citizen initiative that the Legislature passed last year and to align it with other state and federal laws. Republicans frame the effort as a strategy to gut the earlier measure, which lays out certain rights for the parents of public school students.
The bill passed on a party-line vote, 56-39. Democrats at one point invoked a rule to halt debate on amendments, which sped up proceedings but also blocked Republicans from voicing concerns.  
“Not every child in this state or in this country has the benefit of parents who are loving, who are supportive, who are there for them,” said Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, D-Seattle, who chairs the House Education Committee. 
Republicans slammed the bill, at times characterizing it as one of the worst Democrats have put forward this year. 
“This bill is creating a wedge, putting a wedge between parents and their children,” said Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco. “I feel like the schools should not operate under the premise that the parents are bad or dangerous, that type of premise, again, creates that wedge.” 
House approval moves the legislation closer to becoming state law, but because the bill was amended, it must go back to the Senate before it can potentially head to the governor’s desk.
Initiative 2081 was a citizen initiative that more than 400,000 residents signed onto and that was approved in last year’s legislative session. It declared 15 specific rights for the parents and guardians of public school children under the age of 18. 
Two bills linked to the initiative are currently in play —  Senate Bill 5181, which the House approved on Monday and House Bill 1296, which was overhauled last month to deal largely with the rights of students. The Senate approved House Bill 1296 on Friday.
Some of the biggest changes Senate Bill 5181 would make to the law passed last year are around parents’ access to their children’s medical records, including for mental health counseling.
It would remove the rights of parents to receive prior notification when medical services are being offered to their child, except where emergency medical treatment is required. The same goes for notifications about when a school has arranged directly or indirectly for medical treatment that results in follow-up care outside normal school hours.
Democrats say some of those rights are still included in other state and federal laws but students do have privacy rights when it comes to their health care. For example, a 1985 law gives children 13 years or older the right to mental health treatment without parental consent. 
The bill also removes language from the existing parental rights law that would make medical and mental health records available to a child’s parents. But here again, Democratic lawmakers have suggested that parents should still have access to these types of records under other state laws.
“The medical records that are being referenced are not created in school environments,” said Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver. “Educational records are educational records and are governed by public school policy. Health care records are health care records. Those are not created by school personnel.” 
Similar to the law approved last year, the bill calls for “immediate notification” of parents if there’s an allegation of a crime committed against their child, or if their child is interrogated by police. It also adds other notifications, including when a child has been detained for involvement in criminal activity or if a school shooting occurs.
The bill specifies that schools don’t have to release records to parents who are under investigation for, or charged with, child abuse or neglect.  
During Monday’s floor action, Republicans introduced 15 amendments, of which two were adopted. 
These included ones calling for parents to receive a copy of a child’s public school records within 10 business days, instead of 45 days, and to publish a notice that identifies medical services made available to students without prior consent of a parent or legal guardian.  
Republicans blasted Democrats for cutting off debate. Earlier in the session, Democrats changed the House rules so they could do this with the support of a simple majority rather than two-thirds of members.
“We knew this day might come, but to see it unfold during the Parental Rights initiative — backed by nearly half a million voters — is a disgrace, ” Republican Deputy Minority Leader Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, said in a statement.
Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, said the bill “led to the censorship of representatives of the people of Washington state who strongly supported the initiative.” 
Rejected amendments included ones calling for parents to get prior notification when medical services are being offered to their child, to receive medical records, including for mental health counseling, for children under 12, and to remove the emergency clause that would allow the bill to take effect immediately and prevent it from facing a potential voter referendum. 
Republicans also proposed an amendment to block transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. 
“This amendment relies on two erroneous premises, the first that trans girls are not girls, not true, and the second, that boys are inherently better athletes than girls, not true,” said Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, before Democrats rejected the amendment. 
GOP lawmakers also sought to prohibit pornographic images from instructional materials, but Democrats said certain images may be needed to teach science and health curriculum and voted this down, too.
When the Legislature passed the initiative last year, Democrats said that they would revisit the law if it created confusion.
“That’s exactly what we’re doing, is coming back to provide the clarity that we said needed to be done in order to make sure that the bill that we pass aligns with our current state law,” said Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Auburn, the sponsor of the Senate bill on students’ rights.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1255-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-15 00:01:30.121465

(John Cole/Capital-Star)Brent Copenhaver and his wife Stacey own Talview Dairy Farm, a dairy operation in Lebanon County, and sell most of their milk regionally in Pennsylvania.
To Brent, he thinks there is currently one big issue farmers across Pennsylvania are thinking about.
“I think tariffs definitely are on people’s mind,” Brent Copenhaver said to the Capital-Star. “How that will impact us locally is still, I think, yet to be determined.”
The Copenhavers hosted several high ranking government officials on Monday morning, including U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. She was joined by U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R), U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson – Chair of the House Agriculture Committee –and U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District).
They made the case the tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration will prove beneficial to farmers.

Since Trump made his tariff announcement on April 2, the stock market has experienced volatility, leading to concerns from economists about a potential recession.
Rollins said the effort was to create better trade deals with countries, who she claimed have been taking advantage of America for decades.
“That realignment is disruptive. It’s transformative, but is disruptive,” Rollins said. “And so we’re watching the market adjust to that right now. We believe it will be a short term adjustment.”
McCormick, who supports Trump’s tariff policy, said there has been “uncertainty” with the markets as of late, but he believes that the economy will benefit as new trade deals are ironed out.
During Trump’s first term, some $25 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was used to give direct payments to farmers impacted by trade disputes with China. Rollins said the administration is prepared to provide relief to farmers “if there is damaging consequences to these (trade) negotiations.”
“The hope and the goal is that it won’t be necessary,” Rollins said, but added the administration was prepared to help out farmers, if needed.
Thompson echoed Rollins, saying he was “fully supportive of Trump” on the issue of trade and that he doesn’t expect it will be needed for farmers, but is prepared to support those payments, if needed.
Thompson referenced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and China Phase One deal, during Trump’s administration as proof he trusts the president on resolving the ongoing tariff situation. 
Rollins says “money is there for food banks” 
In March, the USDA notified Pennsylvania and other states across the country that they were cancelling programs to provide $1 billion of federal funding to schools and food banks to allow them to purchase food from farms, according to Politico.
Following the move, Gov. Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Agriculture Sec. Russell Redding held a press conference on March 25 announcing they were pushing back on the USDA action to cancel $13 million over the next three years in funding for Pennsylvania farmers. Redding said he sent a letter to the federal agency to appeal the decision and Shapiro said if it fails, he would consider further legal action.
Rollins said she respects Shapiro, but added he or other leaders in Pennsylvania, “don’t have their facts right, or they’re playing games.”
“They’re trying to make this a political issue,” Rollins said to reporters at Martin’s Family Farm in Myerstown, Lebanon County. “The money is there.”
Rollins argued since becoming the head of the USDA, they’ve “released almost one billion dollars to food banks” and said there is money sitting in state accounts from the USDA to support food banks.

Thompson says no cuts will be made to SNAP
A budget plan from House Republicans would cut $230 billion from the Department of Agriculture, according to Reuters, and Democrats are concerned the cuts would come from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. It “provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget.
Thompson called it a “mistruth” and said that he is “not going to stand for any cuts” to the program.
“These are our neighbors that are living in difficult financial times,” Thompson said. He added that changes can be made to make the program more effective.
During a Q&A with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star in March, Thompson said there would be no reductions to SNAP in the next Farm Bill and would like to expand access to “two vulnerable populations who have never been eligible” for SNAP before: Those previously incarcerated for felony drug charges when they return from prison and “adult children of families that are living in financially challenging circumstances,” who “tend to be children with disabilities.”
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has cited potential cuts to SNAP as reasons he’s opposed recent GOP budget plans.

“Labor is a massive concern” Rollins says
As the Trump administration follows through on its promise of deportations, the president suggested at a cabinet meeting on Thursday that farmers could petition to keep workers without legal status, Reuters reported. Rollins recognized the concern the administration has over the agriculture workforce on Monday.
“Labor continues to be a massive concern for our agriculture community,” Rollins said.
The secretary said she and U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer have been tasked with working with legislative partners to come up with solutions to the issue.
Thompson said in the previous session of Congress, he put together a bipartisan work group to address the challenges facing the agriculture workforce and “in the not too distant future” they will put together a “discussion draft” to get input on potential remedies.
“We need to do this in a tri-partisan way,” Thompson said, making the case that Democrats, Republicans, and the agriculture industry can work together on the matter.
In the past,Thompson said the H2-A visa program, which helps American farmers fill temporary employment gaps by hiring workers from other countries, needs to be reformed, including making it “year round.”

How’s the Farm Bill?
Thompson said that the Farm Bill, which is passed roughly every 5 years, is “coming along nicely.”
In 2024, Congress approved a one-year extension of the bill, as the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are on the clock to pass the next version of the legislation.
Will it pass this year?
“You bet,” Thompson said. “It absolutely should. The sooner in the year is the better, obviously.”
Thompson previously told the Capital-Star his goal was to “get this done in the first six months and as early as possible.”
With elected leaders and Secretary Rollins on hand, Brent Copenhaver said he was “honored” to host them and “promote the dairy industry.” He described updating the Farm Bill as important to local farmers as well and specifically wanting to see updated language for dairy margin coverage (DMC).
“Those numbers are based off your production history, and those numbers are outdated,” he said. “We have improved on how we have handled our cows. We have improved our milk production, and I think they need to go back and revisit and look at that production history and allow us to increase that production history to be on a more average of what we are doing today.”
“We just need to update some of the things. It’s already in the bill. We just need it updated,” Copenhaver added. “And it’s a great program that the USDA does offer.”

Brad Little leaves his office to give the State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, at the Idaho Statehouse. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Monday issued a line-item veto on a bill to retain the governor’s emergency fund.
House Bill 482, passed nearly unanimously by the Idaho Legislature, would have eliminated the balance of the governor’s emergency fund. 
In recent years, Little has used the emergency fund to support the investigation into the killings of four University of Idaho students, and for efforts to fight fentanyl and help secure the U.S.’s southern border with Mexico, the governor’s office said in a news release. 
Slightly more than $652,000 remains in the governor’s emergency fund, according to the bill’s fiscal note. 
“As leaders, we need the tools to be agile in responding to crises that affect our citizens. I line-item vetoed this budget bill because eliminating the Governor’s emergency fund only hinders our ability to respond quickly in a fast-moving situation,” Little wrote in a prepared statement. “I share the Legislature’s vigor for ensuring government is efficient, but citizens expect government to be responsive in times of crisis.”
The bill would have zeroed out the governor’s emergency fund by directing the State Controller’s Office to transfer all remaining balance in the fund to the state’s general fund “as soon as practicable” for Idaho’s current fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
Little’s line-item veto rejected that transfer, but approved the bill’s other fund transfers into law. 
The governor’s emergency fund transfer would have, according to the bill’s fiscal note, centralized “the state’s emergency funds in the Office of Emergency Management in the Military Division.”
In his veto letter, Little called it critical for the governor’s emergency fund to maintain the funds. The fund, he wrote, “has been used to address serious and unexpected situations that fall outside of a formally declared state of emergency.”
 Unclear if Idaho Legislature will reconvene to respond to line-item veto

It’s not immediately clear how the Idaho Legislature will respond to the governor’s line-item veto.
The Legislature adjourned for the year, officially called sine die, more than a week ago on April 4. During the legislative session, the Legislature can override gubernatorial vetoes with two-thirds support in the House and Senate.

With support from 60% of members, the Legislature can call itself back in for a special session. House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, doubted that would happen but said legislative leaders could see if there’s a desire for a special session, he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Monday.
But Moyle called the veto unusual, saying the governor could still access $31 million in emergency funds if he declared an emergency. The fund the bill would’ve zeroed out was created as a response to COVID-19, Moyle said. 
“He could declare an emergency and still send the officers to the border. He could declare an emergency and still help out up there …” Moyle said. “This wasn’t to reduce funding. Usually, a veto is to reduce funding. This is to increase funding in his own budget. This is not normal.”
Shanon Gray, an attorney for the family of homicide victim Kaylee Goncalves, provided a statement from the family in support of the governor’s line-item veto.
“We are in support of keeping the governor’s emergency fund,” the family wrote. “In a case like ours, where a terrible tragedy occurred in a small jurisdiction in Idaho the promise of a Governor who prioritizes justice over dollars was pivotal in our case. Using the emergency fund to allocate resources to Moscow in order for a proper investigation to be done was one of the most critical pieces in bringing the defendant to justice.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Mainers told U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree Monday night that she and other Democrats are not doing enough.  
A litany of questions at a town hall at Westbrook Performing Arts Center delivered a post-mortem of the 2024 election: Democrats have a messaging problem. Democrats lost young voters. Democrats don’t say things plainly. Constituents also delivered sharp criticism of what they view as insufficient action from Democrats to stop President Donald Trump from dismantling the separation of powers and disregarding the rule of law.   
Pingree agreed. “I take it all as valid criticism,” she said. 
The 1st District representative also told the crowd of more than 700 that she’s working on it. “I am in the fight every single day,” she vowed. 
Her constituents commended her for hosting the forum, noting the rest of Maine’s congressional delegation has not afforded such opportunities. Pingree also hosted a town hall in Camden on Sunday but before that, the last in-person town hall she did was in 2017, when Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Trump’s first term. Pingree also hosted a virtual town hall with state Attorney General Aaron Frey last month about the importance of state-level challenges to counter Trump.
But attendees ultimately told Pingree she needs to take more of a stand. 
“Why are Democrats not doing more to resist the Trump administration and putting on a united front?” asked Alex Wu, senior at Scarborough High School and founding member of the youth advocacy team of Democracy Maine, which focuses on making government more accessible. 
“I’ve seen you wear pink,” Wu said, referring to disjointed messaging with some Democratic congresswomen sporting the color during a speech last month to call attention to Trump’s actions negatively impacting women. “I want to see disruption.”

Wu and others also shared their desire for Pingree and other Democrats to deploy the strategies Republicans have used for decades, such as interrupting normal procedure. 
“What is the vision? What’s the mission? Where’s our Project 2027 or 2029?” another attendee asked, referring to Project 2025, the blueprint written by the conservative Heritage Foundation for reshaping the federal government, some of which has now been executed by the Trump administration.   
Mainers requested Pingree take a page out of Trump’s playbook, so-to-speak. Stop acting like politicians, they reiterated. 
Pingree did not go so far as to call Trump a Nazi who was sending people to concentration camps, as one attendee continuously requested before being escorted out by police for interrupting. However, Pingree did reiterate a statement she made earlier Monday on social media demanding the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant who was in the U.S. legally that the Trump administration sent to, as Pingree put it, a “Salvadoran gulag.” 
The Democratic caucus spends a lot of time trying to get messaging right, Pingree said, and in turn ends up making things complicated, though she vowed to try to make things as clear as possible. 
At the request of another attendee, she also said she’d pitch to her colleagues having short, to the point “COVID-19-pandemic era style” press conferences to outline the implications of Trump’s policies for all Americans. 
Ultimately, however, Pingree said she’s never going to “win” as just one member of Congress, nor can the 215 Democrats in the House. 
“We’ve talked a lot about Democrats today and I’ll take it all on my shoulders,” Pingree said. “I will try to do everything better and I will do everything I can to get my colleagues to do it better. But in the long run, [Republicans] control the House. They control the Senate. We only need three of them to change their minds.” 
Not all attendees wanted Pingree to provide a better backstop against the Trump administration. One attendee from Portland questioned whether she’ll always act reflexively against whatever Trump does. 
Pingree countered that she wouldn’t always but so far she hasn’t supported the president’s actions.
“If Donald Trump does things that I’m in favor of — if there are tariffs that I think makes sense — I would be wholeheartedly behind them,” Pingree said. “If there are things that [Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] does to remove toxins from our food or get rid of dyes and colors or support regenerative agriculture, I will wholeheartedly be in favor of it.”
While much of the night focused on federal policies, some attendees asked Pingree to weigh in on related state-level issues and had some local Democratic members of the state Legislature in attendance to listen in: Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson, Sen. Tim Nangle and Reps. Drew Gattine, Suzanne Salisbury and Morgan Rielly. 
One constituent raised concern about the dismantling of the federal Department of Education having implications for the state, which is separately facing a budget deficit. 
Anna Kellar, executive director of the League of Women Voters, asked Pingree if she would oppose the referendum to require identification at the polls.
Pingree did not provide a direct answer, but Kellar raised this question in relation to the representative’s recent vote against the SAVE Act that would require voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, which Pingree criticized as a sort of “poll tax,” given the cost of passports and argued would disenfranchise married women, given that many change their name. 
Kellar told Maine Morning Star after the town hall that they weren’t surprised Pingree did not weigh in on the state issue, adding that the League hasn’t made a formal request to her office for a stance yet. 
However, Kellar appreciated Pingree’s focus on some of the lesser known consequences of the SAVE Act, such as the implications for married women, and said the League is hoping to similarly highlight impacts of the state referendum that Kellar and others argue would make voting harder. 
“I think [Pingree] can help us connect those dots,” Kellar said. “I do think that there is a really important role that she could play here.”

Brad Little signed into law a bill to let ivermectin be sold as an over-the-counter medicine — without a prescription or consultation with a health care professional.
Typically used to treat parasites in humans, ivermectin has drawn interest since the COVID pandemic — after largely conservative activists, doctors and politicians inaccurately touted it as an alternative medicine.
Usually, the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration, or FDA, handles whether drugs should be made available over-the-counter, a process that uses data on safety and effectiveness.
The FDA hasn’t approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, saying the federal agency finds existing clinical trial data don’t show “ivermectin is effective against COVID-19 in humans.” The federal regulator’s website also warns large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous,” overdose can risk death, and human-appropriate doses can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners.
Little on Monday signed Senate Bill 1211, the ivermectin deregulation bill, according to the governor office’s legislation tracker. The new law takes effect immediately — through an emergency clause.
Passed during the last week of this year’s legislative session, Idaho lawmakers didn’t hear public feedback on the bill from doctors, pharmacists or health care professionals.
The bill was cosponsored by the top Republicans in the Idaho House and Senate — Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star — along with two other lawmakers: Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene.
Pam Eaton, CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association which represents Idaho pharmacies, testified in Senate committee that without an over-the-counter label that includes information like drug interactions, Idaho pharmacies largely can’t sell ivermectin over-the-counter.
Two states allow ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter, according to local news reports: Arkansas passed a law this year, and Tennessee passed a law three years ago. North Carolina is considering a similar bill.

Nancy Mace told Republicans at a county convention Monday that she was among the targets of a Pennsylvania man charged last week with threatening to kill President Donald Trump and other officials.
The 1st District congresswoman said U.S. Capitol Police called her while she was on her way to Greenville to inform her that Shawn Monper threatened to kill her too in an online post in January.

“He wanted to put a bullet in my head. No way!” she told about 1,000 people gathered for the Greenville County GOP convention.
Monper, 32, of Butler, Pennsylvania, was arrested last Wednesday and accused of threatening to kill Trump, Elon Musk, immigration agents, and others, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday.
According to the release, threats from a self-identified “Mr. Satan” were posted on YouTube between Jan. 15 and April 5. They included a Feb. 17 threat to kill Trump, Musk, all of Trump’s appointed directors and “anyone who stands in the way.”
Mace told the crowd she was the only known member of Congress named in the threats.
Fox News was first to report Mace being a target. Mace told reporters from the Gazette and other outlets at the convention before taking the stage to address the convention as a guest speaker.
“I will not back down to the threats,” Mace told reporters. “I will not back down to the intimidation. I will not back down to anyone who is threatening to put a bullet in my head.”
U.S. Capitol Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night about Mace’s claims. And a Mace spokeswoman did not respond when asked if authorities were pursuing additional charges related to threats against her.
According to the Department of Justice, the FBI was alerted to the threats on April 8, and the internet activity of “Mr. Satan” came from Monper’s home. The statements included claims of stocking up on guns and ammunition to “do a mass shooting.”
Trump survived a pair of assassination attempts, the first at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, when the gunman’s bullets killed one attendee, seriously injured two others, and injured Trump’s ear before Secret Service agents killed him.
Mace, who is considering a 2026 bid for governor, told reporters she’s close to a decision. She said she’s spoken to Trump about running to replace term-limited Gov. Henry McMaster and knows the president’s endorsement isn’t guaranteed.
“I don’t manage what he does or how he does it or who he endorses,” she said. “But if I do run, I’ll be working very hard to get his support.”
Mace, first elected to represent the coastal 1st District in 2020, cast herself to the GOP faithful in South Carolina’s largest county as someone who will bring Trump’s “America first” agenda to South Carolina “from the state all the way down to the local level.”
She repeatedly said she will not back down despite the threats.
“I will stand up for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance every day of the week. I don’t care,” she told the crowd.
“I will never stop fighting for Donald J. Trump,” she said to conclude her speech, calling to voters’ mind the moment of defiance when Trump mouthed “fight” and pumped his fist after getting shot in Pennsylvania.
She left the stage to a standing ovation.
Next to take the stage as guest speaker was state Treasurer Curtis Loftis. The headliner was longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, who spent four months in federal prison last for defying a congressional subpoena.
Attendees told the Gazette they believe Mace definitely has a chance of becoming the next governor, citing her loyalty to Trump and name recognition.
A Winthrop Poll in February found that South Carolinians were more familiar with Mace than any other potential Republican candidate for governor they were asked about.
Mace has been criticized recently for not holding an in-person town hall to answer her constituents’ questions. She has repeatedly cited safety concerns as the reason why.
She held a surprise virtual town hall last week, though she didn’t promote it or give advance notice.
“We will do in-person town halls as soon as it’s safe to do so,” she told reporters at the convention. “But I’ve had multiple bomb threats. I’ve had people threaten to blow up my office multiple times.”
If she runs, Mace is expected to be part of a crowded field that will potentially include Lt. Gov Pam Evette, Attorney General Alan Wilson, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, and state Sens. Sean Bennett of Summerville and Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration on Monday launched an investigation into the Washington office tasked with overseeing public schools, citing allegations that the state directed a school district to implement a gender inclusion policy that conflicts with federal law.
The investigation puts the 1,800-student La Center School District at the middle of the escalating battle between the U.S. Department of Education and the state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction over approaches to inclusivity in schools.
The Department of Education alleges OSPI is violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment and Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools and education programs that receive federal funding. 
An OSPI spokesperson called the Department of Education’s intervention a “potential overreach of the federal government’s authority.” 
The probe is the latest development in a yearslong battle between the Clark County district and the state. The saga has consumed La Center to the point that a timeline of the conflict is posted on the district website’s landing page.
The clash is centered on a debate over preferred pronouns.
In 2022, district Superintendent Peter Rosenkranz ordered staff not to ask students about their pronouns. Rosenkranz told teachers they should still use students’ preferred pronouns if requested. 
A teacher, who was also the adviser for the La Center High School Gay Straight Alliance, argued the policy “creates a systemic barrier towards full inclusivity of LGBTQ students.”
In late February of this year, the state found La Center violated state law related to discrimination based on gender identity. Its gender-inclusive policy also didn’t comply with statute, the state investigation determined. 
Washington’s model policy, adopted in 2020, says school staff must “privately ask known transgender or gender-expansive students how they would like to be addressed in class, in correspondence to the home, and at conferences with the student’s parent/guardian.”
The district also differed with the state policy on communicating with parents of gender-expansive students, according to the OSPI investigation. The district’s policy tells staff to “be transparent with parents/guardians of children who question their gender identity so that the parents/guardians may provide appropriate support for their children.”
It also states that “curriculum, instruction, and gender affirming activities may cause gender confusion for children.”
In a school board meeting, a former La Center student shared how this policy affected them. They said district staff “forcibly outed” them to their family, leading to “physical abuse by a family member, significant disruption to their education, and a negative impact on their mental health,” according to the OSPI investigation.
The state’s report said La Center’s policy “does not address the unique challenges and needs faced by transgender students in public schools in a nondiscriminatory manner.”
Rising tensions
The state ordered La Center to rescind the pronoun directive and send a new proposed policy that complies with state law within 45 days. Within 35 days of approval, the district had to implement the policy. 
OSPI also required training for staff on bias based on gender identity.
The district appealed the findings last month.
In an interview Monday, the La Center superintendent, Rosenkranz, said he was “very happy” to hear of the federal inquiry. He wants the district to be able to focus on academics, but said “OSPI is trying to bully the La Center School District into submission,” with threats to withhold federal funding if school officials don’t follow state law.
“We continue to move forward to support families as they raise their children,” Rosenkranz said. “The state is choosing to deny parents of that right.”
After reading a news story about the district’s battle with the state, Department of Education officials reached out to Rosenkranz to learn more, he said, leading to Monday’s investigation announcement.
OSPI spokesperson Katy Payne said in an email that the agency “will continue to steadfastly follow the laws of the state of Washington, which provide clear civil rights protections for our transgender and gender-expansive youth that fit squarely inside the protections provided under federal law.”
The U.S. Department of Education didn’t provide comment late Monday.
The inquiry significantly intensifies tensions between the state and federal government. Most of this conflict in the education sphere since President Donald Trump took office in January has focused on transgender athletes.
For example, the Kennewick School District in eastern Washington late last month filed a complaint with the feds over the state allowing trans athletes to participate in girls’ and women’s sports. 
Also last month, the Department of Education launched an investigation into the Tumwater School District, near Olympia, for letting a transgender athlete from another school compete in a girls’ high school basketball game. 
Washington is now also the latest state to face the education department’s ire. Federal officials have also launched investigations in California and Maine over alleged Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act violations. 
In a letter last month, Education Secretary Linda McMahon told schools they must abide by the law “if they expect federal funding to continue.”
“Attempts by school officials to separate children from their parents, convince children to feel unsafe at home, or burden children with the weight of keeping secrets from their loved ones is a direct affront to the family unit,” McMahon wrote. “When such conduct violates the law the Department will take swift action.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P27-Inauguration-250115-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 22:02:23.861769

Josh Shapiro's official residence early Sunday morning. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Harrisburg man charged with setting fire to Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence Sunday had a turbulent life marked by other legal troubles, public records show. 
Cody Balmer, 38, was originally scheduled to appear in court this week to answer simple assault charges stemming from a 2023 domestic assault. It involved an altercation with his former wife and stepson after Balmer had attempted suicide by taking a bottle of pills, he told police according to court records.
Although the latest accusations against Balmer bear the hallmarks of a religiously motivated crime, an expert on extremism said the man’s online footprint shows no immediate indication of ties to extremist groups or ideology. 
“One definitely has to consider that he firebombed a Jewish governor’s residence on Passover. I don’t think that can be ignored,” said Luke Baumgartner, research fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism. “Until more robust reporting or more detailed court documents come forward, nothing is really off the table right now.”

Balmer is charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses. He was arraigned in district court Monday afternoon where he pleaded not guilty and District Judge Dale Klein denied Balmer’s attorney’s request for reasonable bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released. 
Authorities said Balmer scaled the fence at the governor’s residence in downtown Harrisburg shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday and evaded state troopers on Shapiro’s security detail after he was detected on the grounds. State police allege Balmer broke a window and threw a Molotov cocktail into the ground floor of the residence before breaking a second window and entering the ceremonial dining room, where he used a second incendiary to set it ablaze.
Balmer escaped after starting the fire, but turned himself in at state police headquarters later Sunday. He told investigators he harbored hatred toward Shapiro and that if Balmer had encountered Shapiro inside the home he would have attacked the governor  with a hammer he carried.
In a news conference Sunday afternoon, Shapiro noted he had celebrated the first night of Passover with his family and guests in that room hours before they were awakened by a trooper and directed to evacuate. A steely voiced Shapiro vowed the act of violence would not deter him from doing his job to represent Pennsylvanians or to proudly observe his Jewish faith.
Balmer’s Facebook profile shows he’s a father who worked as an auto mechanic, although a former employer distanced itself from Balmer in a social media post saying he had not worked there in more than two years. 
His mother Christie Balmer told CBS news that her son struggled with mental illness and had not been taking his psychiatric medication. Balmer said in court Monday that he had been living with his parents for the past year. 
“This would have never happened if I could have gotten some help the middle of last week because I tried to get him picked up [by police] … and I went through four police departments and I couldn’t get anybody to help,” she said.

“So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened,” she said. Balmer said in court that he had been off his medication because it “led me to different types of behavior,” but he did not elaborate.
Attempts by the Capital-Star to reach Christie Balmer and other relatives at numbers listed in public records were unsuccessful.
Although Balmer denied being mentally ill during his court appearance, Dauphin County court records suggest Balmer had experienced mental health issues several years prior.
In a criminal complaint from January 2023, police said they were called to Balmer’s home in Penbrook, outside Harrisburg, by a child who reported his stepfather was beating his mother. When police arrived, Balmer’s wife Adrian Jones was outside the home crying and yelling about Balmer having assaulted her. 
He told police he had taken a bottle full of pills in an attempt to kill himself and an argument between himself and his wife escalated to the point that his stepson attempted to intervene. Balmer admitted shoving his son and a physical altercation between all three followed. 
Jones said Balmer struck her in the face, bit her hand and struck their 13- and 10-year-old sons. He was charged with three misdemeanor counts of simple assault and was scheduled to appear Wednesday at a plea hearing in Harrisburg, court records say.
Balmer was also charged in 2015 after attempting to cash a forged paycheck for $3,560 at two separate M&T Bank branches on the same day. He pleaded guilty to forgery and was sentenced to 18 months of probation. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Court records show Balmer’s former home in Penbrook was subject to foreclosure proceedings and a sheriff’s sale in 2023. He and Jones also reached an agreement in 2023 for the custody of their daughters in which Balmer received primary physical custody.
Balmer’s Facebook posts delve into politics, but provide no clear evidence of his allegiances. Dauphin County voter registration records show he chose not to be affiliated with any party.
Baumgartner, the extremism researcher at George Washington University, said social media is often used to assess ideological leanings of a suspect in a high profile crime, but cautioned that the initial readings don’t give a full picture. 
He noted that Thomas Matthew Crooks, whom the FBI identified as the gunman who fired at now-President Donald Trump during a July campaign rally, killing a supporter and injuring two others, initially appeared to have no extreme ideological leanings. The FBI later said a social media account believed to belong to Crooks espoused political violence and anti-immigrant and anti-semitic sentiments.
Many of Balmer’s more recent posts are marked private or have been deleted and no posts more recent than the summer of 2023 were visible Sunday. Those that are available include videos from conservative former Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, now director of National Intelligence in the Trump administration, and former Libertarian U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.
His posts express opposition to former President Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, the GOP and the Democratic Party. He also posted memes critical of the COVID-19 pandemic response, suggesting that the media and government overreacted and taking pride in disobeying lockdown orders.
Other posts suggest an inclination toward political violence or crime. One post from 2022 shows a needlepoint hoop with a flaming Molotov cocktail and the words “Be the light you want to see in the world.”

Another theme among his posts are memes with misogynistic and degrading messages about women and male erasure. “Toxic women destroy good men too, but we barely talk about that,” one post says.
There was also at least one post praising a man who was arrested after allegedly hitting dozens of women and another depicting former comedian Bill Cosby suggesting that women he was convicted (and later cleared) of assaulting were promiscuous before he allegedly drugged them. 
Baumgartner said misogyny is often an underlying motivation in far-right extremism, but Balmer doesn’t appear to fit neatly into any ideological category and seems to draw from several. He also expressed opposition to racism and endorsed many traditionally liberal values.
“I didn’t see anything that is indicative of any extremist ideology,” Baumgartner said. “For the most part, it was just sort of run-of-the-mill, ‘I don’t like either party’ content.’”

Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, speaks on the House floor on April 14, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s House majority leader urged a state lawmaker Monday to forgo her legislative pay for a week of the session she missed while taking a family vacation.
Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, returned Monday after missing five days at the Capitol to go with her family on an annual vacation. 
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he met with VanWinkle to ask where she had been.
“She indicated to me that she was on vacation, and I said, ‘That’s inappropriate for a legislator to take vacation during a legislative session.’”
VanWinkle defended her absence and said she’s being unfairly criticized for spending time with her family.
“I don’t know why I’m being singled out in my absence and why everybody else isn’t,” she said. “So it’s a little bizarre to me.” 
North Dakota lawmakers meet for up to 80 days every two years. Lefor said he does not recall any lawmaker taking a family vacation during a legislative session. He said he recently missed his first day over the past 10 years to attend the funeral of his mother-in-law.
Lawmakers are paid $213 per day during the legislative session on top of a $592 monthly salary, said John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council.

Lefor said he does not have the authority to withhold VanWinkle’s pay during her vacation, but suggested she voluntarily give her daily pay back during the time she was absent.
At the end of each floor session, lawmakers routinely vote to excuse absent members. Last Thursday, while VanWinkle was absent, House members voted 55-41 to excuse absent members, with unusually high opposition to the absences.
That vote is largely ceremonial, however, according to Bjornson. State law says lawmakers are “entitled” to be paid.
The only time the Legislative Council has withheld pay from a lawmaker are instances when the lawmaker volunteers to give back the pay for being absent.
“If they ask not to be (paid), we won’t,” Bjornson said.
VanWinkle suggested the House do an audit of lawmaker absences during the session to determine if criticism of her missing days is warranted. She said she hasn’t taken any sick days and she said other lawmakers have taken additional days off around the crossover break.
“Give me the answer, are we allowed absent days, or not?” she said.
VanWinkle said the focus on her absences is an attempt to silence her for her opinions. Earlier this session, VanWinkle drew public backlash for some controversial comments about in-vitro fertilization.
“This just falls right in line with all of their efforts to basically intimidate me and make me feel like I can’t say the things that I’m saying,” she said.
Lefor said telling someone to come to work is not an attempt to silence them.
“The constituents that elect us are ultimately the final say on whether we are sitting here or not,” Lefor said. “If her constituents look at this and want her back, that’s what it is.”
The Legislative Management Committee may discuss the absence policy during the interim, Lefor said.
“It’s things that you don’t think you need to address because I didn’t ever expect to see this,” Lefor said.
Rep. Bob Martinson, R-Bismarck, said he doesn’t think the absence policy should be changed.
“Most of us don’t take vacations during the session,” Martinson said.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said it is pretty hard to tell people whether they can or cannot leave during the legislative session. If the policy were to change to authorized absences, he said he worries the leadership in each chamber would be responsible for qualifying every acceptable absence.
“I don’t think anybody in leadership wants to go down that road,” Weisz said. “The voters put them here and expect them to be here as much as possible.”

Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, mingles ahead of Gov. Mike Kehoe's inauguration ceremony. Brattin's bill on ballot measures passed the House Monday evening (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A bill that would give the Missouri Attorney General the authority to appeal judges’ decisions to temporarily block state law and change how ballot measures are written and certified was sent to the governor Monday. 
The House gave final approval to the bill in a 109-46 vote, with Democrats calling the legislation a “power grab” that targets a Jackson County judge’s temporary hold on the state’s strictest abortion regulations and opening the door for Missouri clinics to resume surgical abortions.
“There is pending litigation going on right now,” said state Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Columbia Democrat. “The Attorney General doesn’t like how it’s going because there’s a preliminary injunction issued, so (Republicans) are trying to jam legislation through so they can change the outcome of the litigation.”
The bill passed Monday would allow Attorney General Andrew Bailey to challenge the preliminary injunction before the judge issues a final ruling on the case.
Democrats argued that since the legislation allows for appeals on “any preliminary injunction that existed prior to August 28, 2025,” it is retroactive and unconstitutional.
State Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Springfield, called the accusation “ridiculous.”
“There’s only one ongoing case that this power grants that it could possibly be used for,” he said.
The House passed an emergency clause on the provision, making it effective as soon as the governor signs it into law. The emergency clause says that “immediate action is necessary to ensure judicial efficiency.”
Missouri law limits emergency clauses to when they are “necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.”
The bill’s House handler, state Rep. Ben Keathley, a Chesterfield Republican, justified the clause because action could “save the lives of women in (facilities that perform abortions) and the children that are the unnecessary victims of these acts.”
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, said this provision was not part of the bill.
“We’re not voting on what the court may do one day,” she said.
The emergency clause passed along party lines with the bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, smiling at the House dais.
Provisions on ballot measures from the General Assembly also drew criticism from Democrats who disagreed with shifting power from the courts to the Missouri Secretary of State.
The bill would give the Secretary of State three chances to rewrite ballot language proposed by state lawmakers after the initial summary is challenged. The courts are charged with giving the Secretary of State advice and approving the final language.
State Rep. Eric Woods, a Kansas City Democrat, said the legislation is an “entire upheaval” of the current process.
“The court exists as a check on us in case we turn out some language that… has ballot candy on it which is completely unrelated to the topic at hand or something that is entirely intended to trick people into voting for it,” Woods said.
He referenced a joint resolution the House is prepared to discuss Tuesday with language he says is deceitful to voters.
Keathley said the courts should be “the last step in the process.”
“We have a constitutional duty and job to send that ballot language through. The courts are only there to call the balls and strikes,” he said.
Since the court has the final say, he said, there is still separation of powers.

Alyssa Brown speaks in favor of bill that would prohibit DEI in local government on April 14, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Legislation banning diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices at the local level passed the Arkansas House of Representatives Monday, sending the bill to the governor’s desk.
Senate Bill 520 is one of several bills targeting culture war issues that have been taken up during the 2025 legislative session. The bill, if it becomes law, would prohibit DEI “offices, officers, policies, or practices in local government.”
Under the proposed law, local governments would be prohibited from implementing hiring and employment policies that take into account diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI offices, or programs, policies, practices or applicant statements that promote DEI.
Local officials or contractors would also be prohibited from compelling another official or contractor to “personally affirm, adopt, or adhere” to certain beliefs or ideals specified in the bill. 
Private citizens would have a right to sue local governments if they do not cease violations of the prohibition within 30 days of being notified under the bill.
Senate Bill 520 is sponsored by Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, in the House and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, in the Senate. Sullivan also sponsored Act 116 of 2025, which repealed state affirmative action programs and prohibited “discrimination or preferential treatment by state entities.”
Sullivan told the Senate last week that the state needed to align itself with the current presidential administration’s positions on DEI. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January that shut down DEI programs within the federal government, and the government has targeted federal grants for cancellation for not complying with the administration’s positions on DEI. 
Rep. Jessie McGruder, D-Marion, criticized the bill on the House floor Monday, asking why SB 520 was targeting local governments when state GOP lawmakers placed so much emphasis on maintaining and returning “local control” to cities and counties. 
“I’m trying to get an understanding of why we’re doing this, because we always say ‘local control,’” McGruder said. “So each city should be able to control what’s happening within their community. We don’t understand the differences in the dynamics that occur in each and every community.”
Brown appeared to take issue with McGruder’s comments when closing for her bill.
“We don’t get to gaslight members with this idea of local control that takes away what is deemed constitutional. We wouldn’t let a local government take away the Second Amendment rights of their citizens,” Brown said. “This bill is about making sure we’re consistent with what we’ve passed on a state level.”
Brown added that “discrimination is illegal under federal and state civil rights law, but this bill ensures that in the process of preventing discrimination, we do not allow our local government to discriminate in its policies.”

Time is fast running out. And there are no visible signs of progress.
But University of Idaho and University of Phoenix officials insist they haven’t given up on the idea of a partnership.
“We continue to be excited about the proposed affiliation with the University of Idaho and the opportunity to support important educational and workforce needs in the state of Idaho,” University of Phoenix spokeswoman Andrea Smiley said in an email to Idaho Education News last week. “The two universities will continue to collaborate to find solutions.”
“We continue to see incredible value in University of Phoenix,” U of I spokeswoman Jodi Walker told EdNews in an email. “However, next steps are in the hands of Phoenix and its ownership team.”
But the State Board of Education has the U of I on a deadline to close a deal with Phoenix, a for-profit online university serving some 85,000 students. That deadline, June 10, is quickly approaching.
And what’s more, the State Board agreed to an extension in order to give the two universities time to win over skeptical legislators. And that hasn’t happened — at least not publicly.
The 2025 legislative session came and went without a Phoenix bill, a committee hearing, or any kind of vote. That silence stood in a stark contrast to the 2024 session. The Legislature stymied the $685 million Phoenix deal — with the Idaho Senate killing a bill that would have restructured the purchase — after lawmakers complained that they had been left in the dark by the parties’ closed-door negotiations.
In short, U of I and Phoenix officials now have less than two months to settle on a deal to meet the State Board’s deadline. And with the Legislature adjourned until January, it isn’t clear how lawmakers would have a chance to weigh in on a revamped deal — unless they returned to Boise for a special session.
In the meantime, as the U of I suggests, the next move belongs to Phoenix.
The State Board’s extension also gave Phoenix the latitude to talk to other would-be buyers. Phoenix is continuing to explore “other transaction opportunities,” Smiley said.
One option could involve going public.
As Bloomberg reported in March, Phoenix’s ownership groups are considering an initial public offering, perhaps as early as the third quarter of 2025.
And what about the State Board — which has the U of I on the clock?
The State Board did not respond to a request for comment.
The board meets Wednesday and Thursday at the U of I. And while U of I President C. Scott Green is expected to address the board and deliver the university’s annual report, the board has no Phoenix-related item on its agenda.

Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, speaks on the House floor on April 14, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill requiring school and public libraries to relocate content deemed “sexually explicit” passed the House on a 49-45 vote Monday after nearly 90 minutes of debate.
Senate Bill 2307, sponsored by Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, would allow people who challenge library content to seek a state’s attorney’s opinion if they don’t agree with a local content review process. 
If the content is deemed obscene by the state’s attorney and not removed, state funding to the library or school could be withheld. The bill also allows a state’s attorney to prosecute violations, though it’s not clear who would be prosecuted.
Implementing the bill is estimated to cost $1.1 million for 2025-27, or $2 million over the next four years, to add an age verification system for the state’s online library database. 
Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, who voted against the bill, said the bill’s fiscal note doesn’t address the costs that will be added to county state’s attorney’s offices.
Committee recommends ‘do not pass’ on controversial North Dakota library content bill

“The cost of this was not determined and, of course, was a concern for the (Appropriations) Committee,” Murphy said.
Other critics of the bill have said there will be additional costs for local libraries to implement it.
The House Appropriations Committee issued a do-not-pass recommendation for the bill on a 22-1 vote Friday.
Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, who voted in favor of the bill, said the $1.1 million in costs for the age verification was a small price to pay to ensure that obscene content is kept from children.
He said he found it odd the House Judiciary Committee voted 12-1 to recommend passage of the bill while the House Appropriations Committee came to the opposite result.
Many comments from lawmakers referred to some library content as pornography.
“By passing this bill, we affirm that taxpayer dollars should never be used to purchase pornography,” said Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake.
One book lawmakers objected to was the “Heartstopper” LGBTQ graphic novel series that had been challenged at the Forman school library. The bill sponsor also distributed a list of the American Library Association’s top challenged books, along with a list of which North Dakota libraries carried them. Many of the books have LGBTQ themes or discuss sexual assault. 
In a statement, the ACLU of North Dakota said the bill amounts to censorship and questioned who will decide what is considered obscene or sexually explicit.
“Government officials cannot impose their personal moral values on others,” Cody Schuler, ACLU of North Dakota advocacy manager, said in a statement. “If you don’t like a book, don’t read it – or don’t let your kids read it. It’s as simple as that.”
Barring a reconsideration of Monday’s House vote, the bill will be sent to Gov. Kelly Armstrong for his consideration.

(Photo by F. Jimenez/National Park Service)Opponents of a controversial predator control program in Western Alaska are seeking a court order to halt this year’s work before state officials kill any more bears.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance last week filed an application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the state Department of Fish and Game from starting its planned bear- and wolf-killing program in late spring and early summer. If the predator control takes place, it would be the third year of a state program that has so far killed 180 bears and 19 wolves.
The program is aimed at boosting the population of the faltering Mulchatna Caribou Herd. The herd, which in the 1990s numbered about 200,000, is down to only about 15,000, according to the Department of Fish and Game. Hunting of those caribou has been closed since 2021.
Even though a state judge ruled on March 14 that the program violates the Alaska constitution, the Department of Fish and Game is preparing to embark on its third year of bear and wolf removals. The Alaska Board of Game on March 27 approved the department’s emergency petition to resume the program.
Department officials, in arguing in favor of the emergency determination, told board members that they needed to be able to get into the field in time for the caribou calving season to make sure that bears are not preying on newborn calves.
The department contends that predation, mostly by bears, is keeping the Mulchatna Caribou Herd population low.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance and other opponents of the predator control program contend that the state’s plan is based on faulty science and that other factors, including habitat changes, are responsible for the drop in caribou numbers. They argue that the state’s program could harm bear populations, including the internationally famous population that roams Katmai National Park and Preserve.
The March 14 ruling came in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi found that the predator control program violated constitutional mandates for due process and sustained yield.
A separate but similar lawsuit filed by Anchorage attorney Michelle Bittner is still pending.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance, in its April 10 memorandum in favor of a restraining order, said the state’s efforts to continue killing bears “suggests the Department and Board are contemptuous” of the judiciary’s role in interpreting the state constitution.
The emergency regulation was not justified or legal, the memorandum argued. “The effort to circumvent the court’s ruling (in) this case through an emergency regulation is misguided and unlawful. Blatant efforts to sidestep court rulings must be recognized by the judiciary as such, and rejected,” the document said.
The Alaska Department of Law will take action to support the predator-control plan, a spokesperson said.
“The State’s position is that the Board acted within the available law to address an emergency regulation petition. The State intends to oppose the motion,” Patty Sullivan of the Department of Law said by email.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate voted Monday to set residency requirements for classes enrolling in University of Iowa medical and dental programs, despite concerns from some lawmakers that it would create an unfair, affirmative action program in highly sought-after fields.
House File 516, which would require that 80% of students accepted to the UI doctor of medicine or dentistry programs be residents of Iowa or fulfill other qualifications, passed the Iowa Senate with a vote of 34-11.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, filed an amendment that would have barred the UI from lowering its admission standards and the Iowa Board of Regents from penalizing the university if it doesn’t reach the 80% mark. Trone Garriott said these changes would ensure that lower-quality candidates are not chosen over their peers because the university needs to meet a quota.
“The most qualified applicants should be our priority for Iowa’s medical school, but the majority party is going to mandate quotas give special status to one group of students over others based on identity rather than merit,” Trone Garriott said.

She was joined by Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, and other Senate Democrats in calling the proposed requirements an affirmative action program, as it gives preference to a certain group of people based on an aspect of their identity. The debate comes as Republican lawmakers and the governor-appointed regents have been purging programs and policies from state universities related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
To make exceptions for certain applicants because they’re from Iowa would put a stain on all others enrolled in the programs, Bisignano said, and a codified requirement to maintain standards would help push against the possibility of giving Iowans special treatment.
“We’re not talking in those terms, but it’s an affirmative action program. We’re going to weight it towards Iowa applicants,” Bisignano said. “But that doesn’t work in medicine, because not only do you want the best and the brightest, but that’s what draws your investment money in your research, is the quality and the level of your doctors and your research scientists.”
The amendment failed to pass.
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, also filed an amendment that would have applicants state whether they are an Iowa resident, have graduated from an Iowa high school, have family in Iowa or who graduated from an Iowa high school or college, or have lived in a rural community with similar characteristics to Iowa communities.
If none of these qualifications apply to the applicant, Klimesh said they can express interest in completing their medical residency or practicing in the state after graduation. The amendment passed.
“The additional questions we’re asking an amendment 3069 now put Iowa in the same league as other states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, who ask very specific questions of their incoming applicants to ensure they’re getting the mix they need to provide health care in those specific states,” Klimesh said.
The bill returns to the House for consideration of the Senate changes.

Photo by Erick Diaz VelizOn Friday morning, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees meeting at the Hannah Administration Building was disrupted several times by members of the public who advocated for issues including climate change and sexual assault awareness.
Terry Link, 65, founding director of the MSU Office of Campus Sustainability from 2000 to 2009, raised his hand several times without being seen while the board discussed the approval of the Spartan Gateway District.
The project is a major redevelopment effort aimed at transforming about 14 acres located at the southwest side of campus. It will include a hotel, market-rate housing, retail shops, restaurants, office space, parking, a roughly 6,000-seat arena for Olympic sports, and potential future facilities for academic or healthcare purposes.

Before the project was approved by the board, Link stood up and walked toward the podium. He emphasized what he said would be the project’s deceptive ecological impact and called for a reconsideration of its approval. His voice was drowned out by the audience’s applause and the insistent request by board secretary Stefan Fletcher for him to sit quietly.
Regardless, Link expressed his desire to bring up the environmental impact issue, claiming it was something that he needed to do before the approval could be made.
“The university continues to grow. With that growth, we construct new buildings, but instead of building, we’ll be destroying a large number of trees. As we continue to expand, we leave behind an immense footprint,” said Link. “Development we can no longer sustain. We have to reduce. We are exceeding our planet’s capacity. If we don’t change this, younger generations will have no place to live.”
The project was approved 5-1, with the lone no vote from Trustee Myke Balow. 
As Trustee Rema Vassar was finishing her final comment of the meeting, Valery Von Frank, director Parents of Sister Survivors Engage, or POSSE, an organization made up of survivors and parents from ex-MSU doctor Larry Nassar’s abuse, disrupted the meeting from the back of the room.
“None of you have talked about sexual assault awareness,” said Von Frank in her disruption. “You don’t remember. We don’t recall. It should be on the agenda, and yet you spend all your time reading other things.”
Earlier this year, this organization called for an investigation into three MSU trustees: Brianna Scott, Kelly Tebay, and Renee Knake Jefferson, arguing that they had violated the board policy that defines trustees’ fiduciary responsibilities.
“MSU has too soon forgotten what happened on this campus when 547 survivors came forward to MSU about the sexual assault that were committed by their employee,” Von Frank declared after the meeting ended.

The board did not provide any comment on the allegations Link and Von Frank made during the meeting, which followed the arrest of 19 people the night before during a pro-Palestinian sit-in protest held inside the building’s lobby.
The only comment that addressed the arrests during the meeting was from Balow, who stated that the university cares for students regardless of nationality or belief and that they will always be open to dialogue.
“As long as we are talking and discussing issues under the flag that guarantees our free speech, which many people have died for, we will move in the right direction. So, let’s deal with each other on a human level, lower the temperature, and seek to understand one another.” said Balow.
Beyond that, no member of the board directly addressed the arrests.
David Hogan, 20, a social relations and policy student and member of the Hurriya Coalition, who was part of the group of students who engaged in a dialogue table with university officials, said he wasn’t surprised nothing was said about the arrests. 
“They refuse to acknowledge the arrests because acknowledging the arrests would mean they would be forced to admit that they chose to have students arrested rather than actually working in any constructive way to come to some sort of agreement, or even a commitment to work towards some sort of agreement,” Hogan said.
A request for comment on the arrests, as well as the statements made by Link and Frank, was sent by the Advance to a university spokesperson, but was not returned.

The debate over spending is taking place alongside a discussion about how the state can keep paying for its needs — and whether legislators can keep adequate oversight and control over state dollars.
Friday, Senate Finance and Claims voted 13-9 to approve HB 2 after passing several amendments that added to its bottom line, and it will likely be on the floor Thursday.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, said HB 2 was costing a lot more for the 2027 biennium than the 2025 biennium, and he would be opposing it.
“My constituents did not send me here to spend 18% more than we did two years ago,” Fuller said.
But Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy, D-Box Elder, said he expected to see other proposals that would add more money to HB 2, and it was time to move the $16.6 billion legislation out of committee.
“I think that we need to use this as a cutoff, at least for now, slow it down a little bit,” Windy Boy said.
Some legislators want to slow down House Bill 924, too. Sponsored by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, the controversial piece of legislation would create a new trust fund for Montana.
Jones said the bill collects a lot of small funds that already existed — and people figured out how to raid — into one trust.
He said that fund will earn money for Montanans for generations to come in housing, childcare, disaster resiliency and more.
“This is kind of a Montana-made legacy and investment in the future,” Jones said.
Detractors, though, fear it was rushed into existence and loosens the grip legislators have on their ability to appropriate funds.
On the House floor last week, Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell, said he’d never seen a larger fiscal note than the one for HB 924.
The bill initially directs $679 million from the general fund into the trust.
Monday marks day 74 of the 2025 session, the Montana Legislature has 90 days to complete its work, and both bills are progressing.
At this point in the session, the state budget sometimes looks like it won’t pencil out, with numerous proposals to reduce income and property taxes still in play, and plenty of spending bills alive.
On top of that, prior to the session, a report from the Legislative Fiscal Division warned of the risks of recession and potential federal cuts.
It said continued income tax reductions and spending pressures raise a question about whether the governor’s proposed budget will mean income can match expenses by the 2029 fiscal year.
“Decisions of this magnitude will be made by the 2025 Legislature and will set up Montana’s state finances for success or failure for decades to come,” the report said.

The most recent calculation of bills in play by the Legislative Fiscal Division shows ongoing expenses outpacing ongoing revenues by 2026, and a gap of $500 million by the 2029 fiscal year.
However, the Legislature won’t pass all the bills that reduce income, and it will kill some of the spending ideas, although in a debate last week on the House floor, Falk said he’s worried by the trend.
“Even just the last few days, the line between structural deficit and breaking even has gotten quite a bit worse,” Falk said.
In a press availability Friday, Sen. Christopher Pope, D-Bozeman, said HB 2 is large in part because legislators want some ideas to stay in the mix, but only for the time being.
“There will be a reckoning, and there has to be a reckoning,” Pope said.
Too complex, or an investment for generations?
Jones described HB 924, the Growth and Opportunity Trust, as an opportunity for the legislature to have a significant and positive impact on Montanans for decades.
The bill, which received bipartisan support and opposition with a 53-44 final vote in the House, is a combination of several proposals the Montana Legislature had already heard, Jones said.
He said the trust “is a kind of a conservative, forward looking trust” that takes a portion of volatile revenues and “turns them into long-term assets.”
Montana has a coal trust, but Jones said it’s worth only about $1.2 billion, while other states have tens of billions of dollars in similar trusts, such as Alaska, with $80.3 billion, and Wyoming, with $11.6 billion.
The Montana trust fund would take in about 50% of volatile revenue, such as income from capital gains. He said half of the trust would reinvest funds, and the other half would distribute funds.
A fiscal analysis of the bill said allocations would go to local disaster resiliency, state property tax assistance, water development, bridges and early childhood programming.
Jones said the principle is protected, and withdrawal would require a two-thirds vote by the legislature. He said the bill allows Montana to store money, but it includes recession triggers for hard financial times.
“This is the acorn,” Jones said of the bill. “I’m hoping it will grow into an oak tree.”
Although the bill passed to the Senate, it elicited criticism from both Republicans and Democrats on the House floor.
Falk said the bill came much too late in the process given its heft and complexity, and he would have liked such legislation to be thoroughly vetted by the Legislative Finance Committee.
“If we’re taking tax revenue that creates a surplus, and it’s too high, I think we need to give it back to people,” Falk said. “We don’t even give them interest on their money.”
Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said the bill allocates money for specific purposes in advance, and she wasn’t sure legislators should box themselves out of future decisions that way.
“What this bill does is it takes away from your ability to spend future funds and ties the hands of future legislatures,” Gillette said.
Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said she liked the idea of being able to save money and prepare for the future.
However, Sullivan said she had concerns both about the authority the governor’s office has to reduce the size of transfers and how the bill reserves a portion of future income tax revenue.
She said the structure gives away some legislative power and oversight in the appropriations process.
“The legislature is in charge of appropriations, and we should keep doing our job in that space,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan also said property tax rebates proposed in the bill amount to just $40 for residents, and “we need to amp that up so it’s meaningful for taxpayers.”
Jones agreed that property taxpayers need more help, but he said the only way the executive can touch the funds is during emergencies as outlined with specific language and set triggers in the bill.
In support of the bill, Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, said it might not be the way he would write it, but it would make a difference for Montanans.
Karlen said legislators don’t always have the chance to take up bills that affect their constituents for generations to come.
“What’s in this bill is an ongoing, fiscally responsible way to support pensions, housing, critical infrastructure, water, our early childhood system,” Karlen said.
The bill will have a hearing Tuesday in Senate Finance and Claims.
HB 2 is expected to be on the Senate floor later this week, and the most recent report said the legislative proposal is 0.7% more than the governor’s budget.
In the meantime, a plan still needs to gel for a property tax decrease for residential payers, and an income tax reduction is expected too.
Falk said he’s only in his second session, but he thinks every session, projections show a negative structural balance “in the out years.”
“I think this is worse — way worse — than normal,” he said.
He said legislators will make reconciliations, erasing here and there, and the governor may veto some spending, but he sees the need for work ahead.
Pope sees work ahead as well.
He said he is proud of the work Democrats have done on their priorities, at times with help from nine Republicans in the Senate, whether it be increasing provider rates or help for housing.
At the tail end of the session, he said, the legislature is entering the firefight.
“We have to not only keep pursuing the things that remain undone, and there’s a fair amount of that, yet we also have to circle back every half hour to protect something that’s already been decided, and it can be harrowing,” Pope said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-520632182-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-04-14 20:06:24.441040

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Jumping into the discourse over Nebraska’s budget shortfall, State Auditor Mike Foley sent a letter to state senators Monday alerting them of the financial weight of previously-passed business tax incentive laws.
In a 20-page letter, he wrote that over the next four fiscal years, Nebraska companies stand poised to call in more than $1.5 billion in corporate tax incentives, an expense he said would significantly impact the availability of state general funds.
  The Nebraska State Auditor’s Office is located in the State Capitol. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
The auditor’s letter focuses on the Nebraska Advantage Act, adopted in 2005, and a newer version called the ImagiNe Nebraska Act of 2020.
He also highlighted the state’s “steadily increasing delinquent tax balances,” which Foley noted were generally unrelated to business tax incentives but still could constitute “hundreds of millions of tax dollars owed but not collected” by the Nebraska Revenue Department.
“When you combine over $1.5 billion in business tax incentives to be used over the next four fiscal years plus potentially hundreds of millions of dollars more in uncollected tax proceeds, the result is a staggering loss of revenue to the state  — all of which must be counterbalanced in some way,” Foley said in a media statement.
He added: “The Legislature must be made aware of these facts in order to pursue sound fiscal policies.”
33,000 jobs in two decades
Before he was auditor, Foley served as lieutenant governor under then-Gov. Pete Ricketts and before that was a state senator. He acknowledged that he supported economic development tax incentives.
But with lawmaker turnover and the “crush” of so many other policy matters and responsibilities, Foley said he suspects that “many senators may not be fully informed of how yesterday’s legislative decisions will most assuredly influence tomorrow’s policy choices.”











Regardless of how the credits are used to receive a tax benefit, the result is a reduction of the state’s tax revenues. 


– State Auditor Mike Foley



The auditor said he and his team recognize the benefit of business-focused economic incentive programs in that they can spur construction, investment and jobs to expand the tax base that helps pay for public services.
Foley acknowledged data from the Nebraska Department of Revenue indicating that corporate tax incentives reportedly have led to more than $25 billion in qualifying capital investments since 2006 and helped create more than 33,000 new full-time Nebraska jobs.
“Whether the claimed benefits are accurate or not, the significant tax breaks now being paid to corporate taxpayers are real and measurable,” Foley said. 
The auditor‘s team concluded that the Nebraska Advantage and ImagiNE Acts appear to contain some “operational inadequacies” that could result in the legislation becoming a “drain” as opposed to a “boon” to the state economy.

Gov. Jim Pillen said he appreciated Foley’s report. He said that when the “current iteration” of tax incentives passed, Nebraska was a high tax state. He described Nebraska now as competitive from an income tax perspective.
“I am of the firm belief that we need to refocus our tax incentive strategy and make them more people-focused and less company-focused,” Pillen said in a statement. “All Nebraska’s tax credit and relief programs should be focused on working class Nebraskans, not Fortune 500 companies.”
 Probe goes back decades

Foley said he does not mean to “opine” on the merits of the tax incentives, but hoped that the information he compiled for lawmakers would “prove worthy” of review in the Legislature’s search for additional revenue sources.
Lawmakers are starting to debate more fully on the floor different components of the two-year budget that by law must be balanced. The session ends June 9, and the latest projected shortfall is $289 million.
Last week the Legislature advanced to a second round of debate a package that would help close the budget gap by about $71 million, partly by clawing back several business-focused incentives and other initiatives that had been previously approved by Pillen and the Legislature.

The auditor’s Monday letter is based on several sources, including financial data found in the state’s accounting system and tax incentive reports, some dating back more than 25 years.
Foley explained incentives under the two key laws, Advantage and ImagiNE: A qualifying company earns annual credits for meeting specific employment and investment benchmarks, and those credits may be used at a later date for any of the following benefits: credit refunds of sales and use taxes paid; credit refunds or offsets of income taxes paid, and credit refunds of real property taxes paid. Additional benefits include direct refunds of sales and use taxes and personal property tax exemptions.
“Regardless of how the credits are used to receive a tax benefit, the result is a reduction of the state’s tax revenues,” said the letter. 
Under the Advantage Act, Foley said, participating companies have already qualified for $2.6 billion in tax credits, and about $1.4 billion remains unused. As of November, the letter said, requests by 57 businesses were pending to claim more credits.
 ‘Serious deficiencies’ 

Foley said that over the next four years, the Revenue Department projects the state will cover more than $1.1 billion in tax credits and direct sales and use tax refunds. That amount, in addition to the $421 million for the ImagiNE program, accounts for the $1.5 billion expense that the auditor foresees over the next four fiscal years.
He said the tax credits also impact other smaller political subdivisions. Said Foley: “When qualifying businesses use credits earned to obtain a refund of prior tax payments, including local-option sales and use taxes levied by municipalities, those local communities are denied an important source of revenue.”
He said that since 2005, nearly $163 million in local sales and use taxes have been refunded to qualifying companies, “resulting in a direct reduction of tax revenues originally intended” for the municipalities.
Foley pointed out “serious deficiencies” in state processes that check on businesses using tax incentives. He said the Department of Revenue is supposed to perform an initial qualification audit and, after that, periodic audits to verify the information. He said those are the department’s only mechanisms for ensuring that participating companies qualify for the benefits received.

The audit team reported that 14 of 20 companies reviewed lacked a timely qualification audit and 17 of those 20 never had a maintenance audit.
“Without the proper and consistent performance of qualification and maintenance audits, the department is incapable of confirming the occurrence of reports for either qualified capital investments or increases in new jobs — both of which were expected when the (Advantage Act) was being promoted to the Legislature,” he said.
The audit noted that the Advantage Act contained no limits on the amount of investment and compensation credits that companies may earn or use. The ImagiNE law did cap the total new annual tax incentives that can be granted.
 Business chamber perspectives 

Bryan Slone, outgoing CEO of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the 2005 Nebraska Advantage Act served the state’s economy through challenging economic times, and needed modernization. He described its successor, the ImagiNE Act, as a streamlined incentive program with “more targeted incentive benefits and reasonable structural caps on the potential state budget effect.”
In designing ImagiNE, Slone said, “the Legislature helped avoid the same tax administrative delays and uncertainties that have plagued the Nebraska Advantage Act.”  He said ImagiNE is “relevant to today’s economy, while fiscally constrained.”

Slone said Nebraska should still review business tax incentives periodically, in part to measure competitiveness with other states.
“With all of the economic uncertainties these days and a slowing of the economy, we need now more than ever to continue to remain focused on jobs, people attraction and retention, business expansion in our communities and economic growth.”
Heath Mello, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and former state senator, said his network remains steadfast in support of business tax incentives as “critical tools” in attracting and retaining quality jobs and investment.
Mello said a recent analysis from a site selection group ranked Nebraska 45th nationally in economic incentives. He called that a “disappointing” indicator of Nebraska losing opportunities to other states, “depriving” Nebraska of growth and tax revenue.
“The Chamber urges policymakers to stand firm in defense of Nebraska’s economic competitiveness and ensure we are positioned to win in an increasingly competitive national marketplace,” Mellow said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate sent legislation to the governor Monday making changes to Iowa’s election recount process.
House File 928, passed 31-14, would change who can request a recount for an election in Iowa. In races for local offices and the Iowa Legislature, the election would need to have a difference of 1% or 50 votes — whichever is less — for a candidate to request a recount. For statewide and federal races, that threshold is lowered to a 0.15% difference.
Election recount boards would change from their current make-up of a person designated by each candidate, alongside one other individual agreed upon by both candidates. The new system would have county auditors lead the board with their staff and hired election workers, with a requirement that boards must have equal numbers of workers from each political party. Candidates could also be able to choose up to five people to observe the recount in each county.
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, said these changes put Iowa’s recount process in line with other states, and addresses existing problems with potential conflicts of interest that exist in allowing campaigns to oversee the recount process.
“There’s no uniformity, no reliability or enforcement,” Rozenboom said. “That creates distrust the system.”
However, Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said the proposed changes to the recount system — allowing auditors to oversee election recounts — could create conflicts of interest if they are the incumbent party involved in an election recount. Rozenboom countered that county auditors would still be bound by the law to fairly administer recounts.
“I understand the nature of your question, but in the unlikely event that that happens, there’s still their responsibility to do that,” Rozenboom said. “And please note that there will be observers to watch that process.”
But Winckler said the current recount process serves Iowa well, without bringing up potential conflicts of interest posed by the county auditor — who is a partisan elected official — and their staff overseeing the process.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said in the recount elections she has been involved in, “balance” in the process was not an issue as both candidates got to appoint a member of the recount board, and saying that candidates “come out with much greater respect for the process” for ensuring fair election results.
“What we will have if we shift through this new model is candidates feeling very suspicious, very uncertain and not knowing if they can trust what they’re hearing as part of this process — and not feeling represented in it,” Trone Garriott said. “Just because someone is a member of the same political party does not ensure that that person has that candidate’s best interest at heart, or is qualified to be the representative, or is qualified to be part of this process.”
Rozenboom argued that these criticisms do not acknowledge that partisan county auditors are already overseeing elections.
“If we trust them to conduct the election in the first place, it seems reasonable to me that we would trust them to conduct a recount,” Rozenboom said.
The bill would also implement an earlier deadline for requesting a recount, requiring requests be submitted by the end of the day of the second Wednesday after an election. The current deadline is the second Friday after an election. Recounts would be requested through the Secretary of State’s office for legislative, statewide and federal races, a change from the current system where campaigns make requests to each county auditor.
Another portion of the bill requires recounts to be conducted using vote tabulators, whereas current law allows hand-counting in some areas.
Rozenboom said the measure will bring “consistency, reliability, fairness, uniformity and enforcement” to the state’s election recounts.
“Election law is maybe the most important legislation that we can pass in this state, because election law, fair elections, are the absolute bedrock of our system of government,” Rozenboom said. “This legislation will correct flaws in our current system.”

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor/Baraka photo by Fran Baltzer)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka joined members of major progressive organizations in New Brunswick Monday to celebrate their decision last week to endorse his gubernatorial bid.
Baraka, on his third term as mayor of New Jersey’s largest city, has made a push to claim the progressive lane in the crowded race to become New Jersey’s next governor as he vies with five other Democrats to win their party’s nomination on June 10.
He has rallied with protestors outside a planned immigrant jail in Newark, said the state should discuss reparations for slavery, and pushed for a universal basic income. And on Monday he called for “economic prosperity for all working families” alongside members of his new progressive backers, including the New Jersey Working Families Party, New Jersey Citizen Action, and Make the Road Action.
“This is not only our chance to push back against the failed and bankrupt and racist policies of Donald Trump, but it’s also an opportunity for us to build the democracy we want to see in New Jersey, to build economic prosperity for all working families so they’re not crushed by medical bills, they’re not crushed by housing costs, not crushed by inequality and lack of opportunity,” Baraka told an excited crowd outside a union building off the Rutgers University campus.
There are few public polls that have gauged Baraka’s support compared to his Democratic rivals. But a March 5 Fairleigh Dickinson University poll measuring the candidates’ favorability put Baraka on top with self-described progressives, with Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop tied for second. The other three Democrats in the race — Rep. Josh Gottheimer, teachers union chief Sean Spiller, and ex-state Sen. Steve Sweeney — were further behind.
Dan Cassino, director of the poll, said Baraka has taken a simple path to win the support of progressives: going far to the left of the median progressive. But Cassino said it’s unclear what will matter more to progressive voters — progressive policies or opposition to the establishment.  If progressive voters are mad about Trump’s policies, that may play out in Baraka’s favor, while Fulop may gain if more of them are upset about Democrats not standing up to Trump, Cassino said. Fulop has campaigned as an alternative to Democratic machine politics.
“If the race is framed around policy arguments, Baraka is likely to do very well, as his policy stances are rather to the left of his competitors,” Cassino said. “But we’ve seen that Fulop is doing his best to frame the race around opposition to the institutional party: if that’s what people are using to make their decisions, he’s likely to do better.”
Fulop, the three-term mayor of the state’s second-largest city, has touted his “smart, progressive leadership,” but on Monday said he doesn’t define his campaign as a progressive one, adding that he wants to win over moderate Democrats.
“We’ve been tremendously responsible on the financial front, how we think about housing, how we think about driving costs — so I think our campaign is a little different,” he said. “It is the broadest breadth of a coalition of anybody, and I think you’d be hard-pressed to peg us in one corner.”
Fulop brushed off the endorsements Baraka cinched from progressive groups, calling it “fine.” Tens of millions of dollars will be spent in the primary, Fulop said, and no single organization will influence the outcome.
Fulop said he wants to be the candidate with the most detailed policies. Appearing near his childhood home in Edison Monday, he discussed his new plan to make New Jersey more affordable, with ideas ranging from consolidating municipal resources to overhauling the nascent Stay NJ tax cut program for seniors.
Fulop did not mention Trump during his event, while Baraka made Trump’s economic policies and billionaire allies a focal point of his own rally. Baraka said voters are looking for leadership and conversations instead of wonky politician-speak that makes them feel left out.
“If policy was how you win elections, Elizabeth Warren would be on her second term,” he said. “The reality is, people need leadership. They need your voice. They need your action. They need you to inspire them. They need hope.”
Cassino believes the fight over the progressive voting bloc is “less about policy than it is about framing.”
“The question of who most appeals to progressive voters is a question of what concerns are on top of mind among voters at that moment,“ he said.

Rebecca Reimer, R-Chamberlain, speaks on the South Dakota House floor on March 6, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Getting an initiated constitutional amendment on the ballot in South Dakota is plenty tough for citizens. House Bill 1169 would have made it almost impossible.
HB 1169 required that signatures representing 5% of the votes cast for governor in the most recent election be collected from each of the state’s 35 Senate districts to get an initiated constitutional amendment on the ballot. Current law calls for collecting signatures totaling 10% of the votes cast for governor in the last election. Those signatures can come from anywhere in the state.
HB 1169 would have been something of a jobs program for accountants. Not only would petition carriers have needed to figure out 5% of the votes cast for governor in each Senate district, but they would also have had to make sure that their overall total of signatures equaled 10% of the vote total for governor.
The good news about HB 1169 is that it was vetoed by Gov. Larry Rhoden. In his veto message to the Legislature, Rhoden said he feared that the geographic requirement for the collection of signatures would be workable only for big-money groups that have the resources to canvass the entire state.
Legislature sustains veto of geographic signature requirement for constitutional amendment petitions

To override a veto, a two-thirds vote is needed in both chambers in the Legislature. That’s 24 votes in the 35-member Senate and 47 votes in the 70-member House. Fortunately, the Senate vote of 16-16 was not enough to override the veto. The governor’s veto stands, and that’s the good news. However, there’s plenty of bad news to go around.
Part of the bad news is the wide-ranging support that such an onerous change had in the Legislature. Bills with such success are usually destined to become law. HB 1169 flew through the House State Affairs Committee on a vote of 10-1 and through the House on a vote of 60-9. In the Senate State Affairs Committee, it fared just as well, earning passage on a 7-1 vote. It was only in the Senate where the bill met some resistance, but still passed, 19-15.
There was more bad news on the last day of the legislative session as the House voted 50-18 to override the veto. Fortunately, both chambers need to override the veto for the bill to become law.
Clearly, HB 1169 has plenty of backers in the Legislature. The bill’s main sponsor, Rep. Rebecca Reimer, a Chamberlain Republican, recognizes that and said in a South Dakota Searchlight story that she would work on the language in the legislation and bring it back next year.
In her testimony to the House State Affairs Committee, Reimer said passage of HB 1169 would ensure that rural voices are heard rather than letting petitioners set up shop in only Rapid City or Sioux Falls to collect signatures. She said the bill “ensures fairness, strengthens voter representation, protects the integrity of our constitutional amendment process.”
Maybe that’s one way to describe the bill. Another would be to say that it’s a cynical, bordering on sinister, attempt to cut citizens out of the initiated amendment process.
This isn’t the Legislature’s only accomplishment when it came to making it tougher for citizens to get their measures on the ballot. Already the subject of a lawsuit, legislators endorsed a bill that would cut the amount of time for gathering signatures by three months. Another measure they placed on the 2026 ballot would raise the threshold for approving a constitutional amendment to 60% rather than relying on a simple majority of voters.
It’s easier for lawmakers to get something on the ballot. They only have to convince a majority of their colleagues. If you’re not lucky enough to be in the Legislature, you have to collect 17,508 signatures for an initiated measure or referred law, or 35,017 signatures for an initiated constitutional amendment.
The bill that was so popular with lawmakers didn’t take into consideration the eccentric nature of legislative districts, the borders of which can veer off in odd directions. It would take a cavalry scout and a GPS for petitioners to figure out if they’re collecting their signatures in the right Senate district.
If one legislative district is stingy with its signatures, the entire effort fails. The state Supreme Court in Idaho struck down a similar law, saying it amounted to giving each legislative district veto power and calling it “tyranny of the minority.”
If Reimer has her way, that tyranny will make its way back to the Legislature in the next legislative session. Here’s hoping the governor has his veto pen ready.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republicans in the North Carolina Senate released their blueprint for state spending Monday evening, outlining a budget that raises pay for teachers and state workers, moves ahead with planned income tax cuts and sets aside money for future Hurricane Helene recovery spending.
The new plan from the GOP majority came with a pledge from its leader that legislators would eliminate “waste” and “bloated” spending from state government.
The two-year budget proposal sets out modest increases in spending, totaling $32.6 billion in 2025-26 and $33.3 billion the year after.
“Without a doubt, this is one of the fastest timelines that we’ve seen for pulling a budget together,” said Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) during a press conference.
Senators will begin moving the budget through their chamber this week; it is set for its first hearing Tuesday morning. When it passes the full Senate, it will move to the House. Leaders have agreed to a top-line spending total with the Senate, but the NC House will make changes and additions of their own.
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, has requested that the GOP-led legislature approve more extensive pay raises, spending on child care and affordable housing.
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch strongly criticized the plan Monday, calling it a “blueprint for neglect and cowardice.” She said it offered “pathetic raises” to public servants and “shortchanges” infrastructure needs.
“Budgets reflect priorities,” Batch said. “And this one, unfortunately, sends a loud, clear message about what my Republican colleagues care about: protecting the wealthy, ignoring working families, and leaving workers behind.”
Pay raises for teachers, state workers
The Senate Republicans’ budget would increase salaries for teachers, law enforcement and government workers over the next two years.
Educators would receive an average 2.3% pay increase next year, and an average 3.5% total increase over the next two years. They’ll also receive a $3,000 bonus over the next two years.
That would bring the average teacher salary in the state to $62,407, according to Berger.
Most state workers would see a 1.25% raise next year, as well as a $3,000 bonus over the next two years. That’s in addition to raises for correctional officers, probation and parole officers, state-funded nurses and other workers.
“This makes concerted efforts to target funds to areas with the most pressing workforce shortages,” Berger said.
Setting aside money for future Helene recovery
State lawmakers have thus far spent about $1.4 billion on recovery from Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina. Any future spending will likely come in a separate bill — but Senate Republicans would set aside another $700 million for future relief spending.
In the meantime, some money would flow to western colleges and Stein’s teams spearheading recovery efforts.
The state is facing major uncertainty on the federal level, with FEMA ending its cost-share and other programs and no new congressional spending on the horizon.
“We remain hopeful that the federal government will provide increased and expedited reimbursement,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell). “But we must be prepared to fend for ourselves.”
Income tax cuts continue, and pledge to cut ‘waste’
The governor has urged lawmakers to pause a series of planned cuts to the state’s income tax rate. He points to a joint forecast of legislative and executive branch economists who predict a shortfall in the coming years.
The Senate Republicans’ budget effectively doubles down on those tax cuts, guaranteeing they take effect in 2027 and 2028 and adding two more triggered cuts in years down the line.
Berger, who has been a leading advocate for the cuts, said Monday he was skeptical of the joint forecast, saying he had “rejected it in the past.” It was used to model this year’s budget, he said, but that he did not have confidence in its accuracy long-term.
“What we have seen is the state’s economy continuing to grow and flourish,” Berger said.
And echoing sentiments on the federal level, Berger said their budget would target “waste” within state government to curb unnecessary spending. He did not provide specifics Monday on what those eliminations might look like, besides a proposal to consolidate community colleges’ administration.
Much of it could come from eliminating long-empty jobs. The budget plan lays out workforce reductions in many departments and agencies that have struggled to chip away at a 20% vacancy rate. It’s not clear as of Monday evening whether those cuts could impact currently employed workers as well.
Health care, Rainy Day funds and DEQ
The Senate Republicans’ budget proposal also :

Requests the Department of Health & Human Services to add work requirements to Medicaid, and repeal “certificate of need” requirement for health care facilities.
Continues to fund NC Innovation, the private research nonprofit that has come under scrutiny by lawmakers, but changes the way it’s funded.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A highway closure Monday morning postponed a scheduled trip to the Pecos for members of New Mexico’s federal delegation, state and tribal officials, who instead gathered at Harry’s Roadhouse to discuss next moves in protecting the fragile Upper Pecos watershed from mining and logging.
Last week, all five members of the all-Democratic federal delegation reintroduced a bill to ban new mining activity in the Upper Pecos watershed, citing Source NM reporting that the new federal administration has reversed its plans to pursue such a ban.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration issued executive orders to increase logging and mining projects across the country. U.S.Sen. Martin Heinrich and Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, both of whom had announced plans to be in the Pecos area Monday, condemned the reversal in interviews with media Monday and noted that local and tribal governments, farming, ranching, acequias, conservation, hunting and fishing groups have called for added federal protections.
“When you have a process like this temporary mineral withdrawal just upended because somebody made a decision in Washington without speaking to anyone on the ground, I think that that should make us concerned for more decisions coming down the line,” Heinrich said.
Pueblo of Jemez 2nd Lt. Gov. Matthew Gachupin Jr., joined the delegation on Monday, as his pueblo has cultural ties to the area.
“The Pecos Watershed Protection Act is a tool we need now, it’s the weapon we need to fight this battle,” he said Monday. “We are in full support of this legislation and pray it will be successful.”
That being said, the Republican Party holds majorities in both chambers of Congress and will slow the bill’s progress, Leger Fernández said.
“We can’t tell you exactly when it will get heard,” she said. “What we are telling you is that if there is an opportunity to move it, to bring attention to the legislation, we will.”
Ralph Vigil, an organizer in Pecos for the nonprofit New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, as well as a member of the Stop Terrero Mine Coalition, said the group will continue to host meetings and river cleanups to keep the issue at the front of people’s minds.
“We have to keep getting people more involved in the community so we can really make a stand, if things go backwards,” Vigil said.
Much of the community opposition dates to the 1991 Terrero mining spill, when floodwaters breached a defunct mine and sent tailing sludge downriver, killing thousands of fish and buried Willow Creek. Cleanup remains ongoing and has cost tens of millions of dollars, including state environment officials’ request for $5.7 million from the Legislature this year.

Heinrich praised state efforts including a ban from the New Mexico State Land Commissioner and designating the Upper Pecos watershed a New Mexico “outstanding natural resource water,” which requires the state’s strictest water quality protections and offers some guardrails for the 200-some mining claims already existing in the region.
“When those designations went in place at the state level, they made it so that those mining claims — even if they are developed — do not have a right to put pollution in any of those tributaries,” Heinrich said. “So it really hems in how much damage could be done.”
Claresse Romero, the president of the San Miguel del Bado Land Grant, said the community will fight back harder, and will seek lawyers to fight new claims by Australian company New World Cobalt to do some exploratory drilling in the old Terrero mine and nearby deposits.
“I feel that our very lives are at stake,” Romero said in a phone call with Source NM. “Our health, the health of our community, the health of our ecosystem, the health of the farming communities, the health of our culture; because it ultimately is all under attack by these corporate means.”
Rep. Anita Gonzales (D-Las Vegas) who attended the impromptu gathering at Harry’s Roadhouse, told Source NM the state will work quickly to adopt a state program to take over regulating pollution in New Mexico’s surface waters — including from future mining — which was made possible by a law governor signed last week.
In the meantime, Gonzales said the local groups will lobby for the legislation to pass through Congress.
“We’ve done a good job of getting the support in place from the tribal governments, acequias, land grant governments, city, county and state. The next step is this federal protection,” Gonzales said. “We just have to hold the line long enough to where we’re able to pick up the momentum again, federally.”

The Trump administration has cracked down on international students they say have forfeited their right to be educated in the U.S., leaving hundreds at risk of deportation. 
Inside Higher Ed has identified more than 1,000 international students and recent graduates who have had their legal status suddenly changed. Attorneys for many of the students have alleged they were targeted for their speech. The Trump administration announced last week it would monitor immigrants’ social media for “antisemitism.” 
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last month the State Department had revoked more than 300 student visas from international students, many of whom engaged in pro-Palestine demonstrations that have swept college campuses.
The Trump administration has taken a hard line against universities where students have protested Israel in the nearly 18 months since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack in which some 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed and more than 250 people kidnapped. The incident kicked off a war between Israel and the extremist organization in which nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the United Nations, mostly women, children and elderly people. 
Trump and other Republicans have painted the largely peaceful protests — and support of Palestine in general — as antisemitic. His administration has threatened 60 universities, including Tulane, with the revocation of federal funding if they fail “to protect Jewish students on campus.”

Josh Shapiro’s official residence was held without bail after his first court appearance Monday afternoon.
Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg pleaded not guilty to eight counts, including attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. 
District Judge Dale Klein denied a request by Balmer’s attorney for reasonable bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released. Balmer is being held at the State Correctional Institue- Camp Hill in Cumberland County..
Balmer’s arraignment had been scheduled for earlier in the day Monday. But, it was postponed when he suffered a medical event not related to his arrest or the events of the night before, state police said.
He was brought to court after receiving treatment at an hospital wearing civilian clothes – blue jeans and an inside-out thermal shirt. Bald-headed, sunken-eyed and wearing a large beard, Balmer let out a long sigh after taking a seat in the courtroom and stared straight ahead waiting for the judge.
During the brief hearing in West Hanover Township outside Harrisburg, Balmer gave terse answers to Klein’s questions. Asked whether he suffered mental illness, he replied, “That’s the rumor, but no ma’am.”

Balmer also told the judge he has “a lot of children,” but refused to disclose how many and said he had been living with his parents for the last year. 
In charges filed Sunday, state police accused Balmer of scaling a fence at the governor’s residence in downtown Harrisburg and using Molotov cocktails to set fire to a ceremonial dining room where Shapiro had celebrated the first night of Passover with family and guests hours earlier.
In a news conference after Balmer turned himself in at state police headquarters in Harrisburg, Shapiro said he and his wife Lori were thankful to first responders and others who had offered support. He added that the attack would not prevent him from serving Pennsylvanians or proudly celebrating his Jewish faith.

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)The only difference between trial lawyers and insurance companies, Gov. Jeff Landry told state lawmakers Monday in his speech to open the 2025 legislative session, is that one wants to skin you from the ankle up and the other wants to skin you from the ear down. 
Landry’s stance that both sides are to blame puts him at odds with the historical approach his fellow Republicans have taken, which has largely put trial lawyers and their roadside billboards in their crosshairs. With his flashy statements, the governor teed up the fight over insurance legislation, which is certain to take center stage in the 59-day session. 
“The only thing worse than a little boy crying wolf is two little boys crying wolf,” Landry said, referring to trial attorneys and the insurance industry. 
 While no Republican lawmakers joined Landry’s staff in standing to cheer for his remarks about insurance, legislative leaders are not necessarily against his plan to hold both parties responsible. 
“It needs to be everybody,” House Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, said in an interview after the governor’s remarks. “I agree with that 100% because none of us are perfect, and certainly those two groups have room to be better.” 
Legislative Democrats seemed inclined to work with the governor. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Matt Willard, D-New Orleans, praised Landry for calling for legislation that would prohibit credit checks for setting insurance premiums. 
“This is a time to do right by the rate payers, by the people of Louisiana,” Willard said in a press conference after the speech.

Lawmakers will start debating insurance bills Tuesday, with the aim of getting the legislation approved as soon as possible. Lawmakers hope Landry will embrace the bills they send him. If not, their early passage could give them the opportunity to override his vetoes. 
Last year, Landry vetoed a highly anticipated, so-called “tort reform” bill that would have further capped damages an auto accident victim can seek from the insurance company of the driver at fault. Trial lawyers, who donated considerable amounts of money to Landry’s gubernatorial campaign, opposed the bill. 
Exiting his honeymoon period after 15 months in office – and on the heels of voters rejecting four of his priority constitutional amendments – Landry is now taking a tougher tone with the trial lawyers community that has largely supported him. 
“I am just as tired of seeing Morris Bart as I am of seeing the lizard,” Landry said at a news conference last week, referring to billboards and commercials from the New Orleans personal injury lawyer and the national insurance company Geico. 
Bart later hit back on social media. 
“Maybe I should learn how to hunt?!!” Bart wrote, referencing a turkey hunting trip to Texas that Landry took the week before with Gordon McKernan, one of Bart’s competitors, and several members of legislative leadership. Those gathered discussed insurance legislation, The Advocate reported. 
At the same time, Landry’s relationship with Commissioner of Insurance Tim Temple has declined, with the pair openly feuding. In an interview Monday, Temple was hesitant to criticize Landry but said he was looking forward to working on the insurance issue with Landry. 
While insurance prices will be the primary theme of the session, Landry also previewed his other legislative priorities for the year, including reorganizing the state Department of Transportation and Development, funding vouchers for private school and a list of “Make America Healthy Again” or MAHA bills. 
Landry’s proposal to provide more funding for private school vouchers through his LA GATOR program, one of his major legislative victories last year, faces an uphill battle. Lawmakers are also seeking money to keep teacher pay at last year’s level, which will require finding approximately $200 million. 
LA GATOR is supposed to cost the state $50 million this year, and some lawmakers are hesitant to fund private school tuition while cutting public school teachers’ pay. 
“Make America Healthy Again” is the slogan of President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime Landry ally. The governor and Kennedy are largely ideologically aligned, including on vaccine skepticism. 
Landry is backing Sen. Patrick McMath’s Senate Bill 14, which would ban “ultra-processed” foods in schools. Similar proposals are being considered or passed by other states. 
Several other bills are being touted as MAHA bills, but Landry has not yet taken a stance on them. They include proposals to remove fluoride from public water systems, to prohibit injecting chemicals into the sky to control the weather and creating the crime of “intentional exposure to a self-spreading pathogen.” 
While Willard commended Landry for wanting to make the population healthier, he emphasized the importance of making decisions based on science. 
“So encouraging exercise and healthy eating patterns, that’s great,” Willard said. “Removing fluoride from the water source and some of the other proposals out there, you know, major concerns.”
